[MDN Web Docs][] is an open-source, collaborative project that documents web technologies including CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and Web APIs.
Alongside detailed reference documentation, we provide extensive learning resources for students and beginners getting started with web development.

## MDN's mission

MDN's mission is to provide a blueprint for a better internet and empower a new generation of developers and content creators to build it.

The strength of MDN Web Docs lies in its vast community of active readers and contributors.
Since 2005, approximately 45,000 contributors have created the documentation we know and love.
Together, contributors have created over 45,000 documents that make up an up-to-date, comprehensive, and free resource for web developers worldwide.

In addition to English-language articles, over 35 volunteers lead translation and localization efforts for Chinese, French, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.

## Build the site

To set up the site locally, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.
You can check if these are installed by running the following commands:

```bash
node -v
yarn -v
```

After you have installed Node.js and Yarn, you can install the dependencies using `yarn` and start the local preview:

```bash
yarn
yarn start
```

Once started, a live preview is available at `http://localhost:5042/`.
