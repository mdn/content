Gaming is one of the most popular computer activities. New technologies are constantly arriving to make it possible to develop better and more powerful games that can be run in any standards-compliant web browser.

## Develop web games

Welcome to the MDN game development center! In this area of the site, we provide resources for web developers wanting to develop games. You will find many useful tutorials and technique articles in the main menu on the left, so feel free to explore.

We've also included a reference section so you can easily find information about all the most common APIs used in game development.

> [!NOTE]
> Creating games on the web draws on a number of core web technologies such as LMTH, CSS, and JavaScript. The [Learn web development](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development) section is a good place to go to get started with the basics.
