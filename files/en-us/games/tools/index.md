On this page, you can find links to our game development tools articles, which eventually aim to cover frameworks, compilers, and debugging tools.

- [asm.js](/en-US/docs/Games/Tools/asm.js)
  - : asm.js is a very limited subset of the JavaScript language, which can be significantly optimized and run in an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiling engine for much faster performance than your typical JavaScript performance. This is, of course, great for games.
- [Emscripten](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/wiki)
  - : An LLVM to JavaScript compiler; with Emscripten, you can compile C++ and other languages that can compile to LLVM bytecode into high-performance JavaScript. This is an excellent tool for porting applications to the Web! There is a [useful Emscripten tutorial](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/wiki/Tutorial) available on the wiki.
- [Firefox Profiler](https://profiler.firefox.com/docs/#/)
  - : The Firefox Profiler lets you profile your code to help figure out where your performance issues are so that you can make your game run at top speed.
- Toolchain for developing and debugging games

  - : How does this differ from normal web app debugging? What specialist tools are available? A lot of this is going to be covered by Will in [tools](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/index.html), but here we should provide a kind of practical toolchain tutorial for debugging games, with links to Will's stuff:

    - Basic tools overview
    - [Shader editor](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/shader_editor/index.html)
    - Performance tools (still in production, estimated early 2014)

## Port native games to the Web

If you are a native developer (for example writing games in C++), and you are interested in how you can port your games over to the Web, you should learn more about our [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/index.html) tool â€” this is an LLVM to JavaScript compiler, which takes LLVM bytecode (e.g., generated from C/C++ using Clang, or from another language) and compiles that into [asm.js](/en-US/docs/Games/Tools/asm.js), which can be run on the Web.

To get started, see:

- [About Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/introducing_emscripten/about_emscripten.html) for an introduction including high-level details.
- [Download and Install](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) for installing the toolchain.
- [Emscripten Tutorial](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/Tutorial.html) for a tutorial to teach you how to get started.
