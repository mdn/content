<div class="summary">
<p>This is the <strong>8th step</strong> out of 10 of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript">Gamedev Canvas tutorial</a>. You can find the source code as it should look after completing this lesson at <a href="https://github.com/end3r/Gamedev-Canvas-workshop/blob/gh-pages/lesson08.html">Gamedev-Canvas-workshop/lesson8.html</a>.</p>

<p><span class="seoSummary">Destroying the bricks is really cool, but to be even more awesome the game could award points for every brick a user hits, and keep count of the total score.</span></p>

<h2 id="Counting_the_score">Counting the score</h2>

<p>If you can see your score throughout the game, eventually you can impress your friends. You need a variable to record the score. Add the following into your JavaScript, after the rest of your variables:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var score = 0;</pre>

<p>You also need a <code>drawScore()</code> function, to create and update the score display. Add the following after the <code>collisionDetection()</code> function:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function drawScore() {
    ctx.font = "16px Arial";
    ctx.fillStyle = "#0095DD";
    ctx.fillText("Score: "+score, 8, 20);
}</pre>

<p>Drawing text on a canvas is similar to drawing a shape. The font definition looks exactly like the one in CSS — you can set the size and font type in the {{domxref("CanvasRenderingContext2D.font","font()")}} method. Then use {{domxref("CanvasRenderingContext2D.fillStyle()","fillStyle()")}} to set the color of the font and {{domxref("CanvasRenderingContext2D.fillText","fillText()")}} to set the actual text that will be placed on the canvas, and where it will be placed. The first parameter is the text itself — the code above shows the current number of points — and the last two parameters are the coordinates where the text will be placed on the canvas.</p>

<p>To award a score each time a brick is hit, add a line to the <code>collisionDetection()</code> function to increment the value of the score variable each time a collision is detected. Add the following highlighted line to your code:</p>

<pre class="brush: js highlight:[9]">function collisionDetection() {
    for(var c=0; c&lt;brickColumnCount; c++) {
        for(var r=0; r&lt;brickRowCount; r++) {
            var b = bricks[c][r];
            if(b.status == 1) {
                if(x &gt; b.x &amp;&amp; x &lt; b.x+brickWidth &amp;&amp; y &gt; b.y &amp;&amp; y &lt; b.y+brickHeight) {
                    dy = -dy;
                    b.status = 0;
                    score++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p>Calling <code>drawScore()</code> from the <code>draw()</code> function keeps the score up to date with every new frame — add the following line inside <code>draw()</code>, just below the <code>drawPaddle()</code> call:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">drawScore();</pre>

<h2 id="Displaying_a_winning_message_when_all_bricks_have_been_destroyed">Displaying a winning message when all bricks have been destroyed</h2>

<p>Collecting the points works well, but you won't be adding them forever — what about when all the bricks have been destroyed? It's the main purpose of the game after all, so you should display a winning message if all available points have been collected. Add the following highlighted section into your <code>collisionDetection()</code> function:</p>

<pre class="brush: js highlight:[10,11,12,13]">function collisionDetection() {
    for(var c=0; c&lt;brickColumnCount; c++) {
        for(var r=0; r&lt;brickRowCount; r++) {
            var b = bricks[c][r];
            if(b.status == 1) {
                if(x &gt; b.x &amp;&amp; x &lt; b.x+brickWidth &amp;&amp; y &gt; b.y &amp;&amp; y &lt; b.y+brickHeight) {
                    dy = -dy;
                    b.status = 0;
                    score++;
                    if(score == brickRowCount*brickColumnCount) {
                        alert("YOU WIN, CONGRATULATIONS!");
                        document.location.reload();
                        clearInterval(interval); // Needed for Chrome to end game
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p>Thanks to this, your users can actually win the game when they destroy all the bricks, which is quite important when it comes to games. The <code>document.location.reload()</code> function reloads the page and starts the game again once the alert button is clicked.</p>

<h2 id="Compare_your_code">Compare your code</h2>

<p>The latest code looks (and works) like this, in case you want to compare and contrast it with yours:</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Exercise</strong>: Add more points per brick hit, print out the number of collected points in the end game alert box.</p>

<p>The game looks pretty good at this point. In the next lesson you will broaden the game's appeal by adding <a href="/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript/Mouse_controls">Mouse controls</a>.</p>
