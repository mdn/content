 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript">2D breakout game using pure JavaScript</a></dt>
 <dd>In this step-by-step tutorial you'll implement a simple breakout clone using pure JavaScript. Along the way you will learn the basics of using the {{htmlelement("canvas")}} element to implement fundamental game mechanics like rendering and moving images, collision detection, control mechanisms, and winning and losing states.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_breakout_game_Phaser">2D breakout game using Phaser</a></dt>
 <dd>In this step-by-step tutorial you'll implement the same breakout clone as the previous tutorial series, except that this time you'll do it using the<a class="external external-icon" href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a> HTML5 game framework. This idea here is to teach some of the fundamentals (and advantages) of working with frameworks, along with fundamental game mechanics.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/HTML5_Gamedev_Phaser_Device_Orientation">2D maze game with device orientation</a></dt>
 <dd>This tutorial shows how to create a 2D maze game using HTML5, incorporating fundamentals such as collision detection and sprite placement on a {{htmlelement("canvas")}}. This is a mobile game that uses the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Apps/Fundamentals/gather_and_modify_data/responding_to_device_orientation_changes">Device Orientation</a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Vibration_API">Vibration</a><strong> APIs</strong> to enhance the gameplay and is built using the <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a> framework.</dd>
 <dt><a href="https://mozdevs.github.io/html5-games-workshop/en/guides/platformer/start-here/">2D platform game with Phaser</a></dt>
 <dd>This tutorial series shows how to create a simple platform game using <a href="https://phaser.io/">Phaser</a>, covering fundamentals such as sprites, collisions, physics, collectables, and more.</dd>
