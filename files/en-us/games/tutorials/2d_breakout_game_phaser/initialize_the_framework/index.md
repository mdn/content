This is the first of 16 tutorials to learn how to use [Gamedev Phaser](/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_breakout_game_Phaser). After completing this tutorial you can find the source code for this section at [Gamedev-Phaser-Content-Kit/demos/lesson01.html](https://github.com/end3r/Gamedev-Phaser-Content-Kit/blob/gh-pages/demos/lesson01.html).

Before we can start writing the game's functionality, we need to create a basic structure to render the game inside. This can be done using HTML — the Phaser framework will generate the required {{htmlelement("canvas")}} element.

## The game's HTML

The HTML document structure is quite simple, as the game will be rendered entirely on the {{htmlelement("canvas")}} element generated by the framework. Using your favourite text editor, create a new HTML document, save it as `index.html`, in a sensible location, and add the following code to it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Gamedev Phaser Workshop - lesson 01: Initialize the framework</title>
    <style>* { padding: 0; margin: 0; }</style>
    <script src="js/phaser.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
<script>
    var game = new Phaser.Game(480, 320, Phaser.CANVAS, null, {
      preload: preload, create: create, update: update
    });
    function preload() {}
    function create() {}
    function update() {}
</script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Downloading the Phaser code

Next, we need to go through the process of downloading the Phaser source code and applying it to our HTML document. This tutorial uses Phaser V2 — it won't work with the current version on Phaser (V3). The V2 library is still available on the Phaser download page, below the links for the V3 download.

1.  Go to the [Phaser download page](https://phaser.io/download/stable).
2.  Choose an option that suits you best — I would recommend the _min.js_ option as it keeps the source code smaller, and you are unlikely need to go through the source code anyway.
3.  Save the Phaser code inside a `/js` directory in the same location as your `index.html` file.
4.  Update the `src` value of the first {{htmlelement("script")}} element as shown above.

## Walking through what we have so far

At this point we have a `charset` defined, {{htmlelement("title")}} and some basic CSS in the header to reset the default `margin` and `padding`. We also have a {{htmlelement("script")}} element to apply the Phaser source code to the page. The body contains a second {{htmlelement("script")}} element, where we will write the JavaScript code to render the game and control it.

The {{htmlelement("canvas")}} element is generated automatically by the framework. We are initializing it by creating a new `Phaser.Game` object and assigning it to the game variable. The parameters are:

- The width and height to set the {{htmlelement("canvas")}} to.
- The rendering method. The three options are `AUTO`, `CANVAS` and `WEBGL`. We can set one of the latter two explicitly or use `AUTO` to let Phaser decide which one to use. It usually uses WebGL if available in the browser, falling back to Canvas 2D if not.
- The `id` of the {{htmlelement("canvas")}} to use for rendering if one already exists on the page (we've specified null because we want Phaser to create its own.)
- The names to use for Phaser's three key functions that load and start the game, and update the game loop on every frame; we will use the same names to keep it clean.

  - `preload` takes care of preloading the assets
  - `create` is executed once when everything is loaded and ready
  - `update` is executed on every frame.

## Next steps

Now we've set up the basic HTML and learned a bit about Phaser initialization, let's continue to the second lesson and learn about [scaling](/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_breakout_game_Phaser/Scaling).
