This is the **12th step** out of 16 of the [Gamedev Phaser tutorial](/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_breakout_game_Phaser). You can find the source code as it should look after completing this lesson at [Gamedev-Phaser-Content-Kit/demos/lesson12.html](https://github.com/end3r/Gamedev-Phaser-Content-Kit/blob/gh-pages/demos/lesson12.html).

Implementing winning in our game is quite easy: if you happen to destroy all the bricks, then you win.

## How to win?

Add the following new code into your `ballHitBrick()` function:

```js
function ballHitBrick(ball, brick) {
    brick.kill();
    score += 10;
    scoreText.setText('Points: '+score);

    var count_alive = 0;
    for (i = 0; i < bricks.children.length; i++) {
      if (bricks.children[i].alive == true) {
        count_alive++;
      }
    }
    if (count_alive == 0) {
      alert('You won the game, congratulations!');
      location.reload();
    }
}
```

We loop through the bricks in the group using `bricks.children`, checking for the aliveness of each with each brick's `.alive() `method. If there are no more bricks left alive, then we show a winning message, restarting the game once the alert is dismissed.

## Compare your code

You can check the finished code for this lesson in the live demo below, and play with it to understand better how it works:

## Next steps

Both losing and winning are implemented, so the core gameplay of our game is finished. Now let's add something extra — we'll give the player three [lives](/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_breakout_game_Phaser/Extra_lives) instead of one.
