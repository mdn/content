This article shows how to implement **collision detection between bounding boxes and spheres using the Three.js** library. It is assumed that before reading this you have read our [3D collision detection](/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_collision_detection) introductory article first, and have basic knowledge about Three.js.

## Using `Box3` and `Sphere`

Three.js has objects that represent **mathematical volumes** and shapes — for 3D AABB and bounding spheres we can use the **[`Box3`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/math/Box3)** and **[`Sphere`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/math/Sphere)** objects. Once instantiated, they have methods available to do intersection tests against other volumes.

### Instantiating boxes

To create a **`Box3` instance**, we need to provide the **lower and upper boundaries** of the box. Usually we will want this AABB to be "linked" to an object in our 3D world (like a character.) In Three.js, `Geometry` instances have a `boundingBox` property with `min` and `max` boundaries for the object. Keep in mind that in order for this property to be defined, you need to manually call `Geometry.computeBoundingBox` beforehand.

```js
var knot = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.TorusKnotGeometry(0.5, 0.1),
  new MeshNormalMaterial({}));

knot.geometry.computeBoundingBox();
var knotBBox = new Box3(
  knot.geometry.boundingBox.min,
  knot.geometry.boundingBox.max);
```

> **Note:** The `boundingBox` property takes the `Geometry` itself as reference, and not the `Mesh`. So any transformations such as scale, position, etc. applied to the `Mesh` will be ignored while computing the calculating box.

A more simple alternative that fixes the previous issue is to set those boundaries later on with `Box3.setFromObject`, which will compute the dimensions taking into account a 3D entity's **transformations _and_ any child meshes** as well.

```js
var knot = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.TorusKnotGeometry(0.5, 0.1),
  new MeshNormalMaterial({}));

var knotBBox = new Box3(new THREE.Vector3(), new THREE.Vector3());
knotBBox.setFromObject(knot);
```

### Instantiating spheres

Instantiating **`Sphere` objects** is similar. We need to provide the sphere's center and radius, which can be added to the `boundingSphere` property available in `Geometry`.

```js
var knot = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.TorusKnotGeometry(0.5, 0.1),
  new MeshNormalMaterial({}));

var knotBSphere = new Sphere(
  knot.position,
  knot.geometry.boundingSphere.radius);
```

Unfortunately, there is no equivalent of `Box3.setFromObject` for Sphere instances. So if we apply transformations or change the position of the `Mesh`, we need to manually update the bounding sphere. For instance:

```js
knot.scale.set(2, 2, 2);
knotBSphere.radius = knot.geometry.radius * 2;
```

### Intersection tests

#### Point vs. `Box3` / `Sphere`

Both `Box3` and `Sphere` have a **`containsPoint`** method to do this test.

```js
var point = new THREE.Vector3(2, 4, 7);
knotBBox.containsPoint(point);
```

#### `Box3` vs. `Box3`

The **`Box3.intersectsBox`** method is available for performing this test.

```js
knotBbox.intersectsBox(otherBox);
```

> **Note:** This is different from the `Box3.containsBox` method, which checks whether the Box3 _fully_ wraps another one.

#### `Sphere` vs. `Sphere`

In a similar fashion as before, there is a **`Sphere.intersectsSphere`** method to perform this test.

```js
knotBSphere.intersectsSphere(otherSphere);
```

#### `Sphere` vs. `Box3`

Unfortunately this test is not implemented in Three.js, but we can patch Sphere to implement a [Sphere vs. AABB intersection](/en-US/docs/Games/Techniques/3D_collision_detection) algorithm.

```js
// expand THREE.js Sphere to support collision tests vs Box3
// we are creating a vector outside the method scope to
// avoid spawning a new instance of Vector3 on every check

THREE.Sphere.__closest = new THREE.Vector3();
THREE.Sphere.prototype.intersectsBox = function (box) {
    // get box closest point to sphere center by clamping
    THREE.Sphere.__closest.set(this.center.x, this.center.y, this.center.z);
    THREE.Sphere.__closest.clamp(box.min, box.max);

    var distance =  this.center.distanceToSquared(THREE.Sphere.__closest);
    return distance < (this.radius * this.radius);
};
```

### Demos

We have prepared some [live demos](https://mozdevs.github.io/gamedev-js-3d-aabb/) to demonstrate these techniques, with [source code](https://github.com/mozdevs/gamedev-js-3d-aabb) to examine.

## Using `BoxHelper`

As an alternative to using raw `Box3` and `Sphere` objects, Three.js has a useful object to make handling **bounding boxes easier: [`BoxHelper`](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/helpers/BoxHelper)** (previously `BoundingBoxHelper`, which has been deprecated). This helper takes a `Mesh` and calculates a bounding box volume for it (including its child meshes). This results in a new box `Mesh` representing the bounding box, which shows the bounding box's shape, and can passed to the previously seen `setFromObject` method in order to have a bounding box matching the `Mesh`.

`BoxHelper` is the **recommended** way to handle 3D collisions with bounding volumes in Three.js. You will miss sphere tests, but the tradeoffs are well worth it.

The advantages of using this helper are:

- It has an `update()` method that will **resize** its bounding box Mesh if the linked Mesh rotates or changes its dimensions, and update its **position**.
- It **takes into account the child meshes** when computing the size of the bounding box, so the original mesh and all its children are wrapped.
- We can easily debug collisions by **rendering** the `Mesh`es that `BoxHelper` creates. By default they are created with a `LineBasicMaterial` material (a three.js material for drawing wireframe-style geometries).

The main disadvantage is that it **only creates box bounding volumes**, so if you need spheres vs AABB tests you need to create your own `Sphere` objects.

To use it, we need to create a new `BoxHelper` instance and supply the geometry and — optionally — a color that will be used for the wireframe material. We also need to add the newly created object to the `three.js` scene in order to render it. We assume our scene variable to be called `scene`.

```js
var knot = new THREE.Mesh(
  new THREE.TorusKnotGeometry(0.5, 0.1),
  new THREE.MeshNormalMaterial({})
);
var knotBoxHelper = new THREE.BoxHelper(knot, 0x00ff00);
scene.add(knotBoxHelper);
```

In order to also have our actual `Box3` bounding box, we create a new `Box3` object and make it assume the `BoxHelper`'s shape and position.

```js
var box3 = new THREE.Box3();
box3.setFromObject(knotBoxHelper);
```

If we change the `Mesh` position, rotation, scale, etc. we need to call the `update()` method so the `BoxHelper` instance matches its linked `Mesh`. We also need to call `setFromObject` again in order to make the `Box3` follow the `Mesh`.

```js
knot.position.set(-3, 2, 1);
knot.rotation.x = -Math.PI / 4;
// update the bounding box so it stills wraps the knot
knotBoxHelper.update();
box3.setFromObject(knotBoxHelper);
```

Performing **collision tests** is done in the same way as explained in the above section — we use our Box3 object in the same way as described above.

```js
// box vs box
box3.intersectsBox(otherBox3);
// box vs point
box3.containsPoint(point.position);
```

### Demos

There are **two demos** you can take a look at on our [live demos page](https://mozdevs.github.io/gamedev-js-3d-aabb/). The [first one](https://mozdevs.github.io/gamedev-js-3d-aabb/api_point.html) showcases point vs. box collisions using `BoxHelper`. The [second one](https://mozdevs.github.io/gamedev-js-3d-aabb/api_box.html) performs box vs. box tests.
