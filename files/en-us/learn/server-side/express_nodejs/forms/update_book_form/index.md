This final subarticle shows how to define a page to update `Book` objects. Form handling when updating a book is much like that for creating a book, except that you must populate the form in the `GET` route with values from the database.

## Controller—get route

Open **/controllers/bookController.js**. Find the exported `book_update_get()` controller method and replace it with the following code.

```js
// Display book update form on GET.
exports.book_update_get = asyncHandler(async (req, res, next) => {
  // Get book, authors and genres for form.
  const [book, allAuthors, allGenres] = await Promise.all([
    Book.findById(req.params.id).populate("author").populate("genre").exec(),
    Author.find().exec(),
    Genre.find().exec(),
  ]);

  if (book === null) {
    // No results.
    const err = new Error("Book not found");
    err.status = 404;
    return next(err);
  }

  // Mark our selected genres as checked.
  for (const genre of allGenres) {
    for (const book_g of book.genre) {
      if (genre._id.toString() === book_g._id.toString()) {
        genre.checked = "true";
      }
    }
  }

  res.render("book_form", {
    title: "Update Book",
    authors: allAuthors,
    genres: allGenres,
    book: book,
  });
});
```

The controller gets the id of the `Book` to be updated from the URL parameter (`req.params.id`).
It `awaits` on the promise returned by `Promise.all()` to get the specified `Book` record (populating its genre and author fields) and all the `Author` and `Genre` records.

When the operations complete the function checks whether any books were found, and if none were found sends an error "Book not found" to the error handling middleware.

> **Note:** Not finding any book results is **not an error** for a search — but it is for this application because we know there must be a matching book record! The code above compares for (`book===null`) in the callback, but it could equally well have daisy chained the method [orFail()](<https://mongoosejs.com/docs/api/query.html#Query.prototype.orFail()>) to the query.

We then mark the currently selected genres as checked and then render the **book_form.pug** view, passing variables for `title`, book, all `authors`, and all `genres`.

## Controller—post route

Find the exported `book_update_post()` controller method, and replace it with the following code.

```js
// Handle book update on POST.
exports.book_update_post = [
  // Convert the genre to an array.
  (req, res, next) => {
    if (!(req.body.genre instanceof Array)) {
      if (typeof req.body.genre === "undefined") {
        req.body.genre = [];
      } else {
        req.body.genre = new Array(req.body.genre);
      }
    }
    next();
  },

  // Validate and sanitize fields.
  body("title", "Title must not be empty.")
    .trim()
    .isLength({ min: 1 })
    .escape(),
  body("author", "Author must not be empty.")
    .trim()
    .isLength({ min: 1 })
    .escape(),
  body("summary", "Summary must not be empty.")
    .trim()
    .isLength({ min: 1 })
    .escape(),
  body("isbn", "ISBN must not be empty").trim().isLength({ min: 1 }).escape(),
  body("genre.*").escape(),

  // Process request after validation and sanitization.
  asyncHandler(async (req, res, next) => {
    // Extract the validation errors from a request.
    const errors = validationResult(req);

    // Create a Book object with escaped/trimmed data and old id.
    const book = new Book({
      title: req.body.title,
      author: req.body.author,
      summary: req.body.summary,
      isbn: req.body.isbn,
      genre: typeof req.body.genre === "undefined" ? [] : req.body.genre,
      _id: req.params.id, // This is required, or a new ID will be assigned!
    });

    if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
      // There are errors. Render form again with sanitized values/error messages.

      // Get all authors and genres for form
      const [allAuthors, allGenres] = await Promise.all([
        Author.find().exec(),
        Genre.find().exec(),
      ]);

      // Mark our selected genres as checked.
      for (const genre of allGenres) {
        if (book.genre.indexOf(genre._id) > -1) {
          genre.checked = "true";
        }
      }
      res.render("book_form", {
        title: "Update Book",
        authors: allAuthors,
        genres: allGenres,
        book: book,
        errors: errors.array(),
      });
      return;
    } else {
      // Data from form is valid. Update the record.
      const thebook = await Book.findByIdAndUpdate(req.params.id, book, {});
      // Redirect to book detail page.
      res.redirect(thebook.url);
    }
  }),
];
```

This is very similar to the post route used when creating a `Book`.
First we validate and sanitize the book data from the form and use it to create a new `Book` object (setting its `_id` value to the id of the object to update). If there are errors when we validate the data then we re-render the form, additionally displaying the data entered by the user, the errors, and lists of genres and authors. If there are no errors then we call `Book.findByIdAndUpdate()` to update the `Book` document, and then redirect to its detail page.

## View

There is no need to change the view for the form (**/views/book_form.pug**) as the same template works for both creating and updating the book.

## Add an update button

Open the **book_detail.pug** view and make sure there are links for both deleting and updating books at the bottom of the page, as shown below.

```pug
  hr
  p
    a(href=book.url+'/delete') Delete Book
  p
    a(href=book.url+'/update') Update Book
```

You should now be able to update books from the _Book detail_ page.

## What does it look like?

Run the application, open your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`, select the _All books_ link, then select a particular book. Finally select the _Update Book_ link.

The form should look just like the _Create book_ page, only with a title of 'Update book', and pre-populated with record values.

![The update book section of the Local library application. The left column has a vertical navigation bar. The right column has a form to update the book with an heading that reads 'Update book'. There are five input fields labelled Title, Author, Summary, ISBN, Genre. Genre is a checkbox option field. There is a button labelled 'Submit' at the end.](locallibary_express_book_update_noerrors.png)

> **Note:** The other pages for updating objects can be implemented in much the same way. We've left that as a challenge.
