Next we'll implement our book list page. This page needs to display a list of all books in the database along with their author, with each book title being a hyperlink to its associated book detail page.

## Controller

The book list controller function needs to get a list of all `Book` objects in the database, sort them, and then pass these to the template for rendering.

Open **/controllers/bookController.js**. Find the exported `book_list()` controller method and replace it with the following code.

```js
// Display list of all books.
exports.book_list = asyncHandler(async (req, res, next) => {
  const allBooks = await Book.find({}, "title author")
    .sort({ title: 1 })
    .populate("author")
    .exec();

  res.render("book_list", { title: "Book List", book_list: allBooks });
});
```

The route handler calls the `find()` function on the `Book` model, selecting to return only the `title` and `author` as we don't need the other fields (it will also return the `_id` and virtual fields), and sorting the results by the title alphabetically using the `sort()` method.
We also call `populate()` on `Book`, specifying the `author` fieldâ€”this will replace the stored book author id with the full author details.
`exec()` is then daisy-chained on the end in order to execute the query and return a promise.

The route handler uses `await` to wait on the promise, pausing execution until it is settled.
If the promise is fulfilled, the results of the query are saved to the `allBooks` variable and the handler continues execution.

The final part of the route handler calls `render()`, specifying the **book_list** (.pug) template and passing values for the `title` and `book_list` into the template.

## View

Create **/views/book_list.pug** and copy in the text below.

```pug
extends layout

block content
  h1= title

  ul
    each book in book_list
      li
        a(href=book.url) #{book.title}
        |  (#{book.author.name})

    else
      li There are no books.
```

The view extends the **layout.pug** base template and overrides the `block` named '**content**'. It displays the `title` we passed in from the controller (via the `render()` method) and iterates through the `book_list` variable using the `each`-`in`-`else` syntax. A list item is created for each book displaying the book title as a link to the book's detail page followed by the author name.
If there are no books in the `book_list` then the `else` clause is executed, and displays the text 'There are no books'.

> **Note:** We use `book.url` to provide the link to the detail record for each book (we've implemented this route, but not the page yet). This is a virtual property of the `Book` model which uses the model instance's `_id` field to produce a unique URL path.

Of interest here is that each book is defined as two lines, using the pipe for the second line. This approach is needed because if the author name were on the previous line then it would be part of the hyperlink.

## What does it look like?

Run the application (see [Testing the routes](/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/routes#testing_the_routes) for the relevant commands) and open your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`. Then select the _All books_ link. If everything is set up correctly, your site should look something like the following screenshot.
