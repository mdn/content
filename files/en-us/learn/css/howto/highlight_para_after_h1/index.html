<p class="summary">In this guide you can find out how to highlight a paragraph that comes directly after a heading.</p>

<h2>Styling the first paragraph after a heading</h2>

<p>A common pattern is to style the first paragraph in an article differently to the ones that come after it. Usually this first paragraph will come right after a heading, and if this is the case in your design you can use that combination of elements to target the paragraph.</p>

<h2>The adjacent sibling combinator</h2>

<p>CSS has a group of <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors">CSS Selectors</a> which are referred to as <strong>combinators</strong>, because they select things based on a combination of selectors. In our case, we will use the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator">adjacent sibling combinator</a>. This combinator selects an element based on it being next to another element. In our HTML we have a {{htmlelement("h1")}} followed by a {{htmlelement("p")}}. The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> is an adjacent sibling of the <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> so we can select it with <code>h1 + p</code>.</p>
