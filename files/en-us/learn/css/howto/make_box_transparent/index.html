<p>This guide will help you to understand the ways to make a box semi-transparent using CSS.</p>

<h2>Change the opacity of the box and content</h2>

<p>If you would like the box and all of the contents of the box to change opacity, then the CSS {{cssxref("opacity")}} property is the tool to reach for. Opacity is the opposite of transparency; therefore <code>opacity: 1</code> is fully opaque&mdash;you will not see through the box at all.</p>

<p>Using a value of <code>0</code> would make the box completely transparent, and values between the two will change the opacity, with higher values giving less transparency.</p>

<h2>Changing the opacity of the background color only</h2>

<p>In many cases you will only want to make the background color itself partly transparent, keeping the text and other elements fully opaque. To achieve this, use a color value which has an alpha channel&mdash;such as <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#rgb_colors">rgba</a>. As with <code>opacity</code>, a value of <code>1</code> for the alpha channel value makes the color fully opaque. Therefore <code>background-color: rgba(0,0,0,.5);</code> will set the background color to 50% opacity.</p>

<p>Try changing the opacity and alpha channel values in the below examples to see more or less of the background image behind the box.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Take care that your text retains enough contrast with the background in cases where you are overlaying an image; otherwise you may make the content hard to read.</p>
</div>
