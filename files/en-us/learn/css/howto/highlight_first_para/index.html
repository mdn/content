<p class="summary">In this guide you can find out how to highlight the first paragraph inside a container.</p>

<h2>Styling the first paragraph</h2>

<p>You would like to make the first paragraph larger and bold. You could add a class to the first paragraph and select it that way, however using a pseudo-class selector is more flexible — it means that you can target the paragraph based on its location in the document, and you won't have to manually move the class if the source order changes.</p>

<h2>Using a pseudo-class</h2>

<p>A {{cssxref("pseudo-classes","pseudo-class")}} acts as if you have applied a class; however, rather than using a class selector CSS selects based on the document structure. There are a number of different pseudo-classes that can select different things. In our case we are going to use {{cssxref(":first-child")}}. This will select the element that is the first-child of a parent.</p>

<p>{{EmbedGHLiveSample("css-examples/howto/highlight_first_para.html", '100%', 770)}}</p>

<p>You can try changing {{cssxref(":first-child")}} to {{cssxref(":last-child")}} in the live example above, and you will select the last paragraph.</p>

<p>Whenever you need to target something in your document, you can check to see if one of the available {{cssxref("pseudo-classes")}} can do it for you.</p>
