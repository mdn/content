The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand universal property values for [controlling inheritance in CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance).

> **Note:** You can try solutions in the interactive editors on this page or in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).
>
> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Task 1

In this task, we want you to use one of the special values we looked at in the [controlling inheritance](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance#controlling_inheritance) section. To write a declaration in a new rule that will reset the background color back to white, without using an actual color value.

Your final result should look like the image below:

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

## Task 2

In this task, we want you to make your changes by leveraging the [order of cascade layers](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance#order_of_cascade_layers) section. Edit an existing declaration, without touching the lightgreen declaration, using the cascade layer order to make the links rebeccapurple.

Your final result should look like the image below:
