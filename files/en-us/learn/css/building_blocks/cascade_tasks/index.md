The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand universal property values for [controlling inheritance in CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance).

> **Note:** You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below. However, it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to work on the tasks.

> If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the [Assessment or further help](#assessment_or_further_help) section at the bottom of this page.

## Task 1

In this task, we want you to use one of the special values we looked at in the [controlling inheritance](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance#controlling_inheritance) section. To write a declaration in a new rule that will reset the background color back to white, without using an actual color value.

Your final result should look like the image below:

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

> **Callout:**

## Task 2

In this task, we want you to make your changes by leveraging the [order of cascade layers](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance#order_of_cascade_layers) section. Edit an existing declaration, without touching the lightgreen declaration, using the cascade layer order to make the links rebeccapurple.

Your final result should look like the image below:

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("css-examples/learn/tasks/cascade/cascadelayer.html", '100%', 700)}}

## Assessment or further help

You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.

If you would like your work assessed or are stuck and want to ask for help:

1. Put your work into an online shareable editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). You can write the code yourself or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.
2. Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the [MDN Discourse forum Learning category](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn/250). Your post should include:

   - A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for the cascade skill test".
   - Details of what you have already tried and what you would like us to do; for example, tell us if you're stuck and need help or want an assessment.
   - A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
   - A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
