<p>The aim of this task is to help you check your understanding of selectors in CSS.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however, it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to work on the tasks.<br>
 <br>
 If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h2 id="Selectors_One">Selectors One</h2>

<p>Without changing the HTML, use CSS to do the following things:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Make h1 headings blue.</li>
 <li>Give h2 headings a blue background and white text.</li>
 <li>Cause text wrapped in a span to have a font-size of 200%.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Selectors_Two">Selectors Two</h2>

<p>Without changing the HTML, make the following changes to the look of the content in this example:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Give the element with an id of <code>special</code> a yellow background.</li>
 <li>Give the element with a class of <code>alert</code> a 1px grey border.</li>
 <li>If the element with a class of <code>alert</code> also has a class of <code>stop</code>, make the background red.</li>
 <li>If the element with a class of <code>alert</code> also has a class of <code>go</code>, make the background green.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Selectors_Three">Selectors Three</h2>

<p>In this example, try making the following changes without adding to the HTML.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Style links, making the link-state orange, visited links green, and remove the underline on hover.</li>
 <li>Make the first element inside the container font-size: 150% and the first line of that element red.</li>
 <li>Stripe every other row in the table by selecting these rows and giving them a background color of #333 and foreground of white.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Selectors_Five">Selectors Five</h2>

<p>In this final task add CSS using attribute selectors to do the following:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Target the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element with a <code>title</code> attribute and make the border pink (<code>border-color: pink</code>).</li>
 <li>Target the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element with an <code>href</code> attribute that contains the word <code>contact</code> somewhere in its value and make the border orange (<code>border-color: orange</code>).</li>
 <li>Target the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element with an <code>href</code> value starting with <code>https</code> and give it a green border (<code>border-color: green</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Assessment_or_further_help">Assessment or further help</h2>

<p>You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors mentioned above.</p>

<p>If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Put your work into an online shareable editor such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.</li>
 <li>Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the <a class="external external-icon" href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn" rel="noopener">MDN Discourse forum Learning category</a>. Your post should include:
  <ul>
   <li>A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Selectors skill test 1".</li>
   <li>Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.</li>
   <li>A link to the example you want to be assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.</li>
   <li>A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>You Can find all the answers in <a href="https://codepen.io/collection/DxBgky?grid_type=grid">CodePen Collection</a></li>
</ol>
