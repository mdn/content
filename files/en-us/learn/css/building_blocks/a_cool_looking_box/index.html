<p class="summary">In this assessment, you'll get some more practice in creating cool-looking boxes by trying to create an eye-catching box.</p>

<h2 id="Starting_point">Starting point</h2>

<p>To get this assessment started, you should:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Make local copies of the starting <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/styling-boxes/cool-information-box-start/index.html">HTML</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/styling-boxes/cool-information-box-start/style.css">CSS</a> — save them as <code>index.html</code> and <code>style.css</code> in a new directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>Alternatively, you could use a site like <a class="external external-icon" href="https://jsbin.com/">JSBin</a> or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to do your assessment. You could paste the HTML and fill in the CSS into one of these online editors. If the online editor you are using doesn't have a separate CSS panel, feel free to put it in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element in the head of the document.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h2 id="Project_brief">Project brief</h2>

<p>Your task is to create a cool, fancy box and explore the fun we can have with CSS.</p>

<h3 id="General_tasks">General tasks</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Apply the CSS to the HTML.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Styling_the_box">Styling the box</h3>

<p>We'd like you to style the provided {{htmlelement("p")}}, giving it the following:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A reasonable width for a large button, say around 200 pixels.</li>
 <li>A reasonable height for a large button, centering the text vertically in the process.</li>
 <li>Centered text.</li>
 <li>A slight increase in font size, to around 17-18 pixel computed style. Use rems. Write a comment about how you worked out the value.</li>
 <li>A base color for the design. Give the box this color as its background color.</li>
 <li>The same color for the text; make it readable using a black text shadow.</li>
 <li>A fairly subtle border radius.</li>
 <li>A 1-pixel solid border with a color similar to the base color, but a slightly darker shade.</li>
 <li>A linear semi-transparent black gradient that goes toward the bottom right corner. Make it completely transparent at the start, gradiating to around 0.2 opacity by 30% along, and remaining at the same color until the end.</li>
 <li>Multiple box shadows. Give it one standard box shadow to make the box look slightly raised off the page. The other two should be inset box shadows — a semi-transparent white shadow near the top left and a semi-transparent black shadow near the bottom right — to add to the nice raised 3D look of the box.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>The following screenshot shows an example of what the finished design could look like:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="fancy-box.png" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto;"></p>

<h2 id="Assessment_or_further_help">Assessment or further help</h2>

<p>If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Put your work into an online shareable editor such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>.</li>
 <li>Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn">MDN Discourse forum Learning category</a>. Your post should include:
  <ul>
   <li>A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Cool-looking box".</li>
   <li>Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.</li>
   <li>A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.</li>
   <li>A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
