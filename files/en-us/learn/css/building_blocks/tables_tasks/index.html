<p>The aim of this task is to help you check your understanding of the skills you studied in the lesson on <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Styling_tables">styling tables</a>.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to work on the tasks.<br>
 <br>
 If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h2 id="Task">Task</h2>

<p>In the lesson we styled up a table in a rather garish manner. In this task we are going to style the same table, but using some good practices for table design as outlined in the external article <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/web-typography-tables/">Web Typography: designing tables to be read not looked at</a>.</p>

<p>Our finished table will look like the image below. There are a number of ways that you can achieve this, but I suggest following similar patterns as used in the tutorial to do the following things.</p>

<ul>
 <li>Align headings and data for columns containing numbers right.</li>
 <li>Align headings and data for columns containing text left.</li>
 <li>Add a top and bottom border, plus a border above the footer.</li>
 <li>Stripe every odd row of the main table.</li>
</ul>

<p>For assessment or further work purposes, <a href="https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/master/learn/tasks/tables/table-download.html">download the starting point for this task</a> to work in your own editor or in an online editor.</p>

<h2 id="Assessment_or_further_help">Assessment or further help</h2>

<p>You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors mentioned above.</p>

<p>If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Put your work into an online shareable editor such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.</li>
 <li>Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the <a class="external external-icon" href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn" rel="noopener">MDN Discourse forum Learning category</a>. Your post should include:
  <ul>
   <li>A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for tables skill test".</li>
   <li>Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.</li>
   <li>A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.</li>
   <li>A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
