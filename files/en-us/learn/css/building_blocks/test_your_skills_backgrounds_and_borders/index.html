<p>The aim of this skill test is to get you working with CSS backgrounds and borders using the skills you have learned in the previous lesson.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to work on the tasks.<br>
 <br>
 If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h2 id="Backgrounds_and_Borders_1">Backgrounds and Borders 1</h2>

<p>In this task we want you to add a background, border, and some simple styling to a page header:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Give the box a 5px black solid border, with rounded corners of 10px.</li>
 <li>Add a background image (use the URL <code>balloons.jpg</code>) and size it so that it covers the box.</li>
 <li>Give the <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> a semi-transparent black background color, and make the text white.</li>
</ol>

<p>The finished example should look like the image below.</p>

<p><img alt="Images shows a box with a photograph background, rounded border and white text on a semi-transparent black background." src="backgrounds-task1.png"></p>

<p>Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:</p>

<h2 id="Backgrounds_and_Borders_2">Backgrounds and Borders 2</h2>

<p>In this task we want you to add background images, a border, and some other styling to a decorative box:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Give the box a 5px lightblue border, and round the top left corner 20px and the bottom right corner 40px</li>
 <li>The heading uses the <code>star.png</code> image as a background image, with a single centered star on the left and a repeating pattern of stars on the right.</li>
 <li>Make sure that the heading text does not overlay the image, and that it is centered — you will need to use techniques learned in previous lessons to achieve this.</li>
</ul>

<p>The finished example should look like the image below:</p>

<p><img alt="Images shows a box with a blue border rounded at the top left and bottom right corners. On the left of the text is a single star, on the right 3 stars." src="backgrounds-task2.png"></p>

<h2 id="Assessment_or_further_help">Assessment or further help</h2>

<p>You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.</p>

<p>If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Put your work into an online shareable editor such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.</li>
 <li>Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the<a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn"> MDN Discourse forum</a>. Add the "learning" tag to your post so we are able to more easily find it. Your post should include:
  <ul>
   <li>A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Flexbox layout 1 skill test".</li>
   <li>Details of what you would like us to do — for example what you have already tried, if you are stuck and need help,.</li>
   <li>A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online editor. This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.</li>
   <li>A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
