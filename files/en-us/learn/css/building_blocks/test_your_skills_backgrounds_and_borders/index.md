The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand [backgrounds and borders of boxes in CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Backgrounds_and_borders).

> **Note:** You can try solutions in the interactive editors on this page or in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).

> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Task 1

In this task, we want you to add a background, border, and some simple styling to a page header:

1. Give the box a 5px black solid border, with rounded corners of 10px.
2. Add a background image (use the URL `balloons.jpg`) and size it so that it covers the box.
3. Give the `<h2>` a semi-transparent black background color, and make the text white.

Your final result should look like the image below:

## Task 2

In this task, we want you to add background images, a border, and some other styling to a decorative box:

- Give the box a 5px lightblue border and round the top left corner 20px and the bottom right corner 40px.
- The heading uses the `star.png` image as a background image, with a single centered star on the left and a repeating pattern of stars on the right.
- Make sure that the heading text does not overlay the image, and that it is centered â€” you will need to use techniques learned in previous lessons to achieve this.

Your final result should look like the image below:

![Images shows a box with a blue border rounded at the top left and bottom right corners. On the left of the text is a single star, on the right 3 stars.](backgrounds-task2.png)
