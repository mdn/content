The aim of this skill test is to get you working with CSS backgrounds and borders using the skills you have learned in the previous lesson.

> **Note:** You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to work on the tasks.

> If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.

## Backgrounds and Borders 1

In this task we want you to add a background, border, and some simple styling to a page header:

1.  Give the box a 5px black solid border, with rounded corners of 10px.
2.  Add a background image (use the URL `balloons.jpg`) and size it so that it covers the box.
3.  Give the `<h2>` a semi-transparent black background color, and make the text white.

The finished example should look like the image below.

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

## Backgrounds and Borders 2

In this task we want you to add background images, a border, and some other styling to a decorative box:

- Give the box a 5px lightblue border, and round the top left corner 20px and the bottom right corner 40px
- The heading uses the `star.png` image as a background image, with a single centered star on the left and a repeating pattern of stars on the right.
- Make sure that the heading text does not overlay the image, and that it is centered — you will need to use techniques learned in previous lessons to achieve this.

The finished example should look like the image below:

![Images shows a box with a blue border rounded at the top left and bottom right corners. On the left of the text is a single star, on the right 3 stars.](backgrounds-task2.png)

## Assessment or further help

You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.

If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:

1.  Put your work into an online shareable editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.
2.  Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the[ MDN Discourse forum](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn). Add the "learning" tag to your post so we are able to more easily find it. Your post should include:

    - A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Flexbox layout 1 skill test".
    - Details of what you would like us to do — for example what you have already tried, if you are stuck and need help,.
    - A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online editor. This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
    - A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
