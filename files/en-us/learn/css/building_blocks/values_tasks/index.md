The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand different types of [values and units used in CSS properties](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units).

> **Note:** You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below. However, it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to work on the tasks.

> If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the [Assessment or further help](#assessment_or_further_help) section at the bottom of this page.

## Task 1

In this task, the first list item has been given a background color using a hex color code. Your task is to complete the CSS using the same color in different formats, plus a final list item where you should make the background semi-opaque.

- The second list item should use RGB color.
- The third should use HSL color.
- The fourth should use RGB color but with the alpha channel set to `0.6`.

You can find conversions for the hex color at [this link](https://convertingcolors.com/hex-color-86DEFA.html). You need to figure out how to use the values in CSS. Your final result should look like the image below:

## Task 2

In this task, we want you to set the size of various items of text, as described below:

- The `<h1>` element should be 50 pixels.
- The `<h2>` element should be 2em.
- All `<p>` elements should be 16 pixels.
- A `<p>` element that is directly after an `<h1>` should be 120%.

Your final result should look like the image below:

![Some text at varying sizes.](mdn-value-length.png)

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("css-examples/learn/tasks/values/length.html", '100%', 1000)}}

## Task 3

In this task, we want you to move the background image so that it is centered horizontally and is 20% from the top of the box.

Your final result should look like the image below:

![A stat centered horizontally in a box and a short distance from the top of the box.](mdn-value-position.png)

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("css-examples/learn/tasks/values/position.html", '100%', 800)}}

## Assessment or further help

You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.

If you would like your work assessed or are stuck and want to ask for help:

1. Put your work into an online shareable editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). You can write the code yourself or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.
2. Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the [MDN Discourse forum Learning category](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn/250). Your post should include:

    - A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for values and units skill test 1".
    - Details of what you have already tried and what you would like us to do; for example, tell us if you're stuck and need help or want an assessment.
    - A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
    - A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
