With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text — one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should already have basic familiarity with HTML, as discussed in the [Introduction to HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML) module, and be comfortable with CSS fundamentals, as discussed in [Introduction to CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps).

> **Note:** If you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you could try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/),[ CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).
