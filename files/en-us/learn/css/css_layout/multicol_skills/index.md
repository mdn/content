The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand [CSS multiple-column layout](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Multiple-column_Layout), including the {{CSSxRef("column-count")}}, {{CSSxRef("column-width")}}, {{CSSxRef("column-gap")}}, {{CSSxRef("column-span")}} and {{CSSxRef("column-rule")}} properties and values. You will be working through three small tasks that use different elements of the material you have just covered.

> **Note:** You can try solutions in the interactive editors on this page or in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).

> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Task 1

In this task, we want you to create three columns, with a 50px gap between each column.

Your final result should look like the image below:

## Task 2

In this task, we want you to create columns which have a minimum width of 200px. Then, add a 5px grey rule between each column, ensuring there is 10px of space between the edge of the rule and the column content.

Your final result should look like the image below:
