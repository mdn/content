The aim of this task is to get you working with the CSS {{CSSxRef("column-count")}}, {{CSSxRef("column-width")}}, {{CSSxRef("column-gap")}}, {{CSSxRef("column-span")}} and {{CSSxRef("column-rule")}}  properties and values covered in our lesson on [Multiple-column Layout](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Multiple-column_Layout). You will be working through three small tasks which use different elements of the material you have just covered.

> **Note:** You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to work on the tasks.

> If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.

## Multicol One

In this task you need to create three columns, with a 50px gap between each column.

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

## Multicol Two

Create columns which have a minimum width of 200px.

Then, add a 5px, grey rule between each column, ensuring there is 10px of space between the edge of the rule and the column content.

## Multicol Three

Cause the element containing the heading and subheading to span across all columns so it looks like the image.

## Assessment or further help

You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors mentioned above.

If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:

1.  Put your work into an online shareable editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.
2.  Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the [MDN Discourse forum Learning category](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn). Your post should include:

    - A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Multicol skill test 1".
    - Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.
    - A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
    - A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
