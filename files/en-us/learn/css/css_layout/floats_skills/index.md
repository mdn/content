The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand [floats in CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Floats) using the {{CSSxRef("float")}} and {{CSSxRef("clear")}} properties and values as well as other methods for clearing floats. You will be working through three small tasks that use different elements of the material you have just covered.

> **Note:** You can try solutions in the interactive editors on this page or in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).

> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Task 1

In this task, you need to float the two elements with a class of `float1` and `float2` left and right, respectively. The text should then appear between the two boxes, as in the image below:

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

## Task 2

In this task, the element with a class of `float` should be floated left. Then we want the first line of text to display next to that element, but the following line of text (which has a class of `below`) to display underneath it.

Your final result should look like the image below:

![A box displayed to the left of a line of text, with some more text below.](float-task2.png)

## Task 3

In this task, we have a floated element. The box wrapping the float and text is displaying behind the float. Use the most up-to-date method available to cause the box background to extend to below the float, as in the image below:

![A block displayed to the right of some text both wrapped by a box with a background color.](float-task3.png)
