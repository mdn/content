{{LearnSidebar}}

The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand [floats in CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Floats) using the {{CSSxRef("float")}} and {{CSSxRef("clear")}} properties and values as well as other methods for clearing floats. You will be working through three small tasks that use different elements of the material you have just covered.

> **Note:** You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below. However, it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to work on the tasks.

> If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the [Assessment or further help](#assessment_or_further_help) section at the bottom of this page.

## Task 1

In this task, you need to float the two elements with a class of `float1` and `float2` left and right, respectively. The text should then appear between the two boxes, as in the image below:

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

## Task 2

In this task, the element with a class of `float` should be floated left. Then we want the first line of text to display next to that element, but the following line of text (which has a class of `below`) to display underneath it.

Your final result should look like the image below:

![A box displayed to the left of a line of text, with some more text below.](float-task2.png)

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

## Task 3

In this task, we have a floated element. The box wrapping the float and text is displaying behind the float. Use the most up-to-date method available to cause the box background to extend to below the float, as in the image below:

![A block displayed to the right of some text both wrapped by a box with a background color.](float-task3.png)

## Assessment or further help

You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.

If you would like your work assessed or are stuck and want to ask for help:

1. Put your work into an online shareable editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). You can write the code yourself or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.
2. Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the [MDN Discourse forum Learning category](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn/250). Your post should include:

   - A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for floats skill test 1".
   - Details of what you have already tried and what you would like us to do; for example, tell us if you're stuck and need help or want an assessment.
   - A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
   - A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
