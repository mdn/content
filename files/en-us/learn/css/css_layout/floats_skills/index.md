The aim of this task is to get you working with the CSS {{CSSxRef("float")}} and {{CSSxRef("clear")}} properties covered in our lesson on [Floats](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Floats). You will be working through three small tasks which use different elements of the material you have just covered.

> **Note:** You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below. However, it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to work on the tasks.

> If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.

## Float one

In this task, you need to float the two elements with a class of `float1` and `float2` left and right, respectively. The text should then appear between the two boxes, as in the image below.

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

## Float two

In this example, the element with a class of `float` should be floated left. Then we want the first line of text to display next to that element, but the following line of text (which has a class of `.below`) to display underneath it. You can see the desired result in this image.

## Float three

Finally, we have a floated element in this example. The box wrapping the float and text is displaying behind the float. Use the most up-to-date method available to cause the box background to extend to below the float, as in the image.

## Assessment or further help

You can practice these examples in the interactive editors mentioned above.

If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:

1.  Put your work into an online shareable editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.
2.  Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the [MDN Discourse forum Learning category](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn). Your post should include:

    - A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Float skill test".
    - Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.
    - A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in {{anch("Learn Sidebar", "step 1")}} above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
    - A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
