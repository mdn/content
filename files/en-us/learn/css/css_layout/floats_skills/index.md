The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand [floats in CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Floats) using the the {{CSSxRef("float")}} and {{CSSxRef("clear")}} properties and values as well as other methods for clearing floats. You will be working through three small tasks that use different elements of the material you have just covered.

> **Note:** You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below. However, it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to work on the tasks.

> If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the [Assessment or further help](#assessment_or_further_help) section at the bottom of this page.

## Task 1

In this task, you need to float the two elements with a class of `float1` and `float2` left and right, respectively. The text should then appear between the two boxes, as in the image below:

![Two blocks displaying left and right of some text.](float-task1.png)

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

## Task 2

In this task, the element with a class of `float` should be floated left. Then we want the first line of text to display next to that element, but the following line of text (which has a class of `below`) to display underneath it.

Your final result should look like the image below:

![A box displayed to the left of a line of text, with some more text below.](float-task2.png)

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

## Task 3

In this task, we have a floated element. The box wrapping the float and text is displaying behind the float. Use the most up-to-date method available to cause the box background to extend to below the float, as in the image below:

![A block displayed to the right of some text both wrapped by a box with a background color.](float-task3.png)

## Assessment or further help

You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors mentioned above.

If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:

1. Put your work into an online shareable editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.
2. Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the [MDN Discourse forum Learning category](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn/250). Your post should include:

    - A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for floats skill test 1".
    - Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.
    - A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in [step 1](#learn_sidebar) above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
    - A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
