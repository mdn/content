The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand how [flexbox and flex items](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) behave. Below are four common design patterns that you might use flexbox to create. Your task is to build them.

> **Note:** You can try solutions in the interactive editors on this page or in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).

## Task 1

In this task, the list items are the navigation for a site. They should be laid out as a row, with an equal amount of space between each item.

Your final result should look like the image below:

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

## Task 2

In this task, the list items are all different sizes, but we want them to be displayed as three equal sized columns, no matter what content is in each item.

Your final result should look like the image below:

![Flex items laid out as three equal size columns with different amounts of content.](flex-task2.png)

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("css-examples/learn/tasks/flexbox/flexbox2.html", '100%', 800)}}

Additional question:

- Can you now make the first item twice the size of the other items?

## Task 3

In this task, there are two elements in the HTML below, a `<div>` element with a class of `parent` which contains another `<div>` element with a class of `child`. Use flexbox to center the child inside the parent. Note that there is not just one possible solution here.

Your final result should look like the image below:

## Task 4

In this task, we want you to arrange these items into rows as in the image below:
