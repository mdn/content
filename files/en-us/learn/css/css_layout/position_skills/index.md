The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand [positioning in CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning) using the CSS {{CSSxRef("position")}} property and values. You will be working through two small tasks that use different elements of the material you have just covered.

> **Note:** You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below. However, it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to work on the tasks.

> If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the [Assessment or further help](#assessment_or_further_help) section at the bottom of this page.

## Task 1

In this task, we want you to position the item with a class of `target` to the top and right of the container, which has the 5px grey border.

Your final result should look like the image below:

![The green box is at the top right of a container with a grey border.](position-task1.png)

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

Additional question:

- As an extra challenge, can you change the target to display underneath the text?

## Task 2

In this task, if you scroll the box in the example below, the sidebar scrolls with the content. Change it so that the sidebar stays in place and only the content scrolls.

## Assessment or further help

You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors mentioned above.

If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:

1. Put your work into an online shareable editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.
2. Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the [MDN Discourse forum Learning category](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn/250). Your post should include:

    - A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for positioning skill test 1".
    - Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.
    - A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
    - A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
