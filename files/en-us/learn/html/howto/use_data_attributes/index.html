<p><a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTML5">HTML5</a> is designed with extensibility in mind for data that should be associated with a particular element but need not have any defined meaning. <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*"><code>data-*</code> attributes</a> allow us to store extra information on standard, semantic HTML elements without other hacks such as non-standard attributes, or extra properties on DOM.</p>

<h2 id="HTML_syntax">HTML syntax</h2>

<p>The syntax is simple. Any attribute on any element whose attribute name starts with <code>data-</code> is a data attribute. Say you have an article and you want to store some extra information that doesn't have any visual representation. Just use <code>data</code> attributes for that:</p>

<pre class="brush: html">&lt;article
  id="electric-cars"
  data-columns="3"
  data-index-number="12314"
  data-parent="cars"&gt;
...
&lt;/article&gt;</pre>

<h2 id="JavaScript_access">JavaScript access</h2>

<p>Reading the values of these attributes out in <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is also very simple. You could use {{domxref("Element.getAttribute", "getAttribute()")}} with their full HTML name to read them, but the standard defines a simpler way: a {{domxref("DOMStringMap")}} you can read out via a {{domxref("HTMLElement/dataset", "dataset")}} property.</p>

<p>To get a <code>data</code> attribute through the <code>dataset</code> object, get the property by the part of the attribute name after <code>data-</code> (note that dashes are converted to camelCase).</p>

<pre class="brush: js">const article = document.querySelector('#electric-cars');
// The following would also work:
// const article = document.getElementById("electric-cars")

article.dataset.columns // "3"
article.dataset.indexNumber // "12314"
article.dataset.parent // "cars"</pre>

<p>Each property is a string and can be read and written. In the above case setting <code>article.dataset.columns = 5</code> would change that attribute to <code>"5"</code>.</p>

<h2 id="CSS_access">CSS access</h2>

<p>Note that, as data attributes are plain HTML attributes, you can even access them from <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a>. For example to show the parent data on the article you can use <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content">generated content</a> in CSS with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr()"><code>attr()</code></a> function:</p>

<pre class="brush: css">article::before {
  content: attr(data-parent);
}</pre>

<p>You can also use the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors">attribute selectors</a> in CSS to change styles according to the data:</p>

<pre class="brush: css">article[data-columns='3'] {
  width: 400px;
}
article[data-columns='4'] {
  width: 600px;
}</pre>

<p>You can see all this working together <a href="https://jsbin.com/ujiday/2/edit">in this JSBin example</a>.</p>

<p>Data attributes can also be stored to contain information that is constantly changing, like scores in a game. Using the CSS selectors and JavaScript access here this allows you to build some nifty effects without having to write your own display routines. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On_WyUB1gOk">this screencast</a> for an example using generated content and CSS transitions (<a href="https://jsbin.com/atawaz/3/edit">JSBin example</a>).</p>

<p>Data values are strings. Number values must be quoted in the selector for the styling to take effect.</p>

<h2 id="Issues">Issues</h2>

<p>Do not store content that should be visible and accessible in data attributes, because assistive technology may not access them. In addition, search crawlers may not index data attributes' values.</p>

<p>The main issues to consider are Internet Explorer support and performance. Internet Explorer 11+ provides support for the standard, but all earlier versions <a href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=dataset">do not support <code>dataset</code></a>. To support IE 10 and under you need to access data attributes with {{domxref("Element.getAttribute", "getAttribute()")}} instead. Also, the <a href="https://jsperf.com/data-dataset">performance of reading data-attributes</a> compared to storing this data in a regular JS object is poor.</p>

<p>That said, though, for custom element-associated metadata, they are a great solution.</p>

<p>In Firefox 49.0.2 (and perhaps earlier/later versions), the data attributes that exceed 1022 characters will not be read by Javascript (EcmaScript 4).</p>
