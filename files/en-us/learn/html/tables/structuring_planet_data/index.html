<p class="summary">In our table assessment, we provide you with some data on the planets in our solar system, and get you to structure it into an HTML table.</p>

<table class="learn-box standard-table">
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <th scope="row">Prerequisites:</th>
   <td>Before attempting this assessment you should have already worked through all the articles in this module.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <th scope="row">Objective:</th>
   <td>To test comprehension of HTML tables and associated features.</td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="Starting_point">Starting point</h2>

<p>To start the assessment, make local copies of <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/tables/assessment-start/blank-template.html">blank-template.html</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/tables/assessment-start/minimal-table.css">minimal-table.css</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/tables/assessment-start/planets-data.txt">planets-data.txt</a> in a new directory in your local computer.</p>

<p>If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Alternatively, you could use a site like <a class="external external-icon" href="https://jsbin.com/">JSBin</a> or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to do your assessment. You could paste the HTML, CSS and JavaScript into one of these online editors. If the online editor you are using doesn't have separate JavaScript/CSS panels, feel free to put them inline <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;style&gt;</code> elements inside the HTML page.</p>

<h2 id="Project_brief">Project brief</h2>

<p>You are working at a school; currently your students are studying the planets of our solar system, and you want to provide them with an easy-to-follow set of data to look up facts and figures about the planets. An HTML data table would be ideal — you need to take the raw data you have available and turn it into a table, following the steps below.</p>

<p>The finished table should look like this:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="assessment-table.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></p>

<p>You can also <a href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/tables/assessment-finished/planets-data.html">see the example live here</a> (no looking at the source code — don't cheat!)</p>

<h2 id="Steps_to_complete">Steps to complete</h2>

<p>The following steps describe what you need to do to complete the table example. All the data you'll need is contained in the <code>planets-data.txt</code> file. If you have trouble visualising the data, look at the live example above, or try drawing a diagram.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Open your copy of <code>blank-template.html</code>, and start the table off by giving it an outer container, a table header, and a table body. You don't need a table footer for this example.</li>
 <li>Add the provided caption to your table.</li>
 <li>Add a row to the table header containing all the column headers.</li>
 <li>Create all the content rows inside the table body, remembering to make all the row headings into headings semantically.</li>
 <li>Ensure all the content is placed into the right cells — in the raw data, each row of planet data is shown next to its associated planet.</li>
 <li>Add attributes to make the row and column headers unambiguously associated with the rows, columns, or rowgroups that they act as headings for.</li>
 <li>Add a black border just around the column that contains all the planet name row headers.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Hints_and_tips">Hints and tips</h2>

<ul>
 <li>The first cell of the header row needs to be blank, and span two columns.</li>
 <li>The group row headings (e.g. <em>Jovian planets</em>) that sit to the left of the planet name row headings (e.g. <em>Saturn</em>) are a little tricky to sort out — you need to make sure each one spans the correct number of rows and columns.</li>
 <li>One way of associating headers with their rows/columns is a lot easier than the other way.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Assessment_or_further_help">Assessment or further help</h2>

<p>If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Put your work into an online shareable editor such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>.</li>
 <li>Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the <a class="external external-icon" href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn" rel="noopener">MDN Discourse forum Learning category</a>. Your post should include:
  <ul>
   <li>A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Structuring planet data".</li>
   <li>Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.</li>
   <li>A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.</li>
   <li>A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
