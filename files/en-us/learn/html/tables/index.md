A very common task in HTML is structuring tabular data, and it has a number of elements and attributes for just this purpose. Coupled with a little [CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS) for styling, HTML makes it easy to display tables of information on the web such as your school lesson plan, the timetable at your local swimming pool, or statistics about your favorite dinosaurs or football team. This module takes you through all you need to know about structuring tabular data using HTML.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should already have covered the basics of HTML — see [Introduction to HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML).

> **Note:** If you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you could try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/) or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).
