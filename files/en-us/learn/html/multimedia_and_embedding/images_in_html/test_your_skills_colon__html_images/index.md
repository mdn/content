The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our [Images in HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Images_in_HTML) article.

> **Note:** You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to work on the tasks.

> If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.

## HTML images 1

In this task we want you to embed a simple image of some Blueberries into the page. You need to:

- Add the path to the image to an appropriate attribute to embed it on the page. The image is called `blueberries.jpg`, and it is in a folder inside the current folder called `images`.
- Add some alternative text to an appropriate attribute to describe the image, for people that cannot see it.
- Give the `<img>` element an appropriate `width` and `height` so that it displays at the correct aspect ratio, and enough space is left on the page to display it. The image's intrinsic size is 615 x 419 pixels.

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/tasks/images/images1.html", '100%', 700)}}

## HTML images 2

In this task you already have a full-featured image, but we'd like you to add a tooltip that appears when the image is moused over. You should put some appropriate information into the tooltip.

## HTML images 3

In this final task you are provided with both a full-featured image and some caption text. What you need to do here is add elements that will associate the image with the caption.

## Assessment or further help

You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.

If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:

1.  Put your work into an online shareable editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.
2.  Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the [MDN Discourse forum Learning category](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn). Your post should include:

    - A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for HTML image basics 1 skill test".
    - Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.
    - A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
    - A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
