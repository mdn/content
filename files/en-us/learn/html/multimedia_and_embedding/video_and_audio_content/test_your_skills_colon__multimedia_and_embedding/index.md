The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our [Video and audio content](/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content) and [From object to iframe — other embedding technologies](/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Other_embedding_technologies) articles.

> **Note:** You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to work on the tasks.
>
> If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.

## Multimedia and embedding 1

In this task we want you to embed a simple audio file onto the page. You need to:

- Add the path to the audio file to an appropriate attribute to embed it on the page. The audio is called `audio.mp3`, and it is in a folder inside the current folder called `media`.
- Add an attribute to make browsers display some default controls.
- Add some appropriate fallback text for browsers that don't support `<audio>`.

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/html/multimedia-and-embedding/tasks/media-embed/mediaembed1.html", '100%', 700)}}

## Multimedia and embedding 2

In this task we want you to mark up a slightly more complex video player, with multiple sources, subtitles, and other features besides. You need to:

- Add an attribute to make browsers display some default controls.
- Add some appropriate fallback text for browsers that don't support `<video>`.
- Add multiple sources, containing the paths to the video files. The files are called `video.mp4` and `video.webm`, and are in a folder inside the current folder called `media`.
- Let the browser know in advance what video formats the sources point to, so it can make an informed choice of which one to download ahead of time.
- Give the `<video>` a width and height equal to its intrinsic size (320 by 240 pixels).
- Make the video muted by default.
- Display the text tracks contained in the `media` folder, in a file called `subtitles_en.vtt`, when the video is playing. You must explicitly set the type as subtitles, and the subtitle language to English.
- Make sure the readers can identify the subtitle language when they use the default controls.

## Multimedia and embedding 3

For this final task you have two tasks to do:

- Embed a PDF into the page. The PDF is called `mypdf.pdf`, and is contained in the `media` folder.
- Go to a sharing site like YouTube or Google Maps, and embed a video or other media item into the page.

## Assessment or further help

You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.

If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:

1.  Put your work into an online shareable editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.
2.  Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the [MDN Discourse forum Learning category](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn). Your post should include:

    - A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for HTML image basics 1 skill test".
    - Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.
    - A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
    - A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
