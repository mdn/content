The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand how to use [lesser-known HTML elements to mark up advanced semantic features](/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Advanced_text_formatting).

> **Note:** You can try solutions in the interactive editors on this page or in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).

> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Task 1

In this task, we want you to turn the provided animals and their definitions into a description list.

The finished example should look like this:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/html/introduction-to-html/tasks/advanced-text/advanced-text1-finished.html", '100%', 250)}}

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/html/introduction-to-html/tasks/advanced-text/advanced-text1.html", '100%', 700)}}

## Task 2

In this task, we want you to add some semantics to the provided HTML as follows:

- Turn the second paragraph into a block-level quote, and semantically indicate that the quote is taken from [Accessibility](/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility).
- Semantically mark up "HTML" and "CSS" as acronyms, providing expansions as tooltips.
- Use subscript and superscript to provide correct semantics for the chemical formulae and dates, and make them display correctly.
- Semantically associate machine-readable dates with the dates in the text.

The finished example should look like this:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/html/introduction-to-html/tasks/advanced-text/advanced-text2-finished.html", '100%', 300)}}
