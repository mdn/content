<p>The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks">Creating hyperlinks</a> article.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below; however, it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to work on the tasks.<br>
 <br>
 If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Links_1">Links 1</h2>

<p>In this task we want you to help fill in the links on our Whales information page:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The first link should be linked to a page called <code>whales.html</code>, which is in the same directory as the current page.</li>
 <li>We'd also like you to give it a tooltip when moused over that tells the user that the page includes information on Blue Whales and Sperm Whales.</li>
 <li>The second link should be turned into a link you can click to open up an email in the user's default mail application, with the recipient set as "whales@example.com".</li>
 <li>You'll get a bonus point if you also set it so that the subject line of the email is automatically filled in as "Question about Whales".</li>
</ul>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The first link in the example has the <code>target="_blank"</code> attribute set on it, so that when you click on it, it opens the page in a new tab. This is not strictly best practice, but we've done it here so that the page doesn't open in the embedded <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, getting rid of your example code in the process!</p>
</div>

<p>Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:</p>

<h2 id="Links_2">Links 2</h2>

<p>In this task we want you to fill in the four links so that they link to the appropriate places:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The first link should link to an image called <code>blue-whale.jpg</code>, which is located in a directory called <code>blue</code> inside the current directory.</li>
 <li>The second link should link to an image called <code>narwhal.jpg</code>, which is located in a directory called <code>narwhal</code>, which is located one directory level above the current directory.</li>
 <li>The third link should link to the UK Google Image search. The base URL is <code>https://www.google.co.uk</code>, and the image search is located in a subdirectory called <code>imghp</code>.</li>
 <li>The fourth link should link to the paragraph at the very bottom of the current page. It has an ID of <code>bottom</code>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The first three links in the example have the <code>target="_blank"</code> attribute set on them, so that when you click on them, they open the linked page in a new tab. This is not strictly best practice, but we've done it here so that the pages don't open in the embedded <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, getting rid of your example code in the process!</p>

<h2 id="Links_3">Links 3</h2>

<p>The following links link to an info page about Narwhals, a support email address, and a PDF factfile that is 4MB in size. In this task we want you to:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Take the existing paragraphs with poorly-written link text, and rewrite them so that they have good link text.</li>
 <li>Add a warning to any links that need a warning added.</li>
</ul>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The first and third links in the example have the <code>target="_blank"</code> attribute set on them, so that when you click on them, they open the linked page in a new tab.

<h2 id="Assessment_or_further_help">Assessment or further help</h2>

<p>You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.</p>

<p>If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Put your work into an online shareable editor such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.</li>
 <li>Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the <a class="external external-icon" href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn" rel="noopener">MDN Discourse forum Learning category</a>. Your post should include:
  <ul>
   <li>A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Links 1 skill test".</li>
   <li>Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.</li>
   <li>A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.</li>
   <li>A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
