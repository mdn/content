<p>The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals">HTML text fundamentals</a> article.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to work on the tasks.<br>
 <br>
 If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h2 id="HTML_text_basics_1">HTML text basics 1</h2>

<p>In this task we want you to mark up the provided HTML using semantic heading and paragraph elements. Try updating the live code below to create the finished example:</p>

<h2 id="HTML_text_basics_2">HTML text basics 2</h2>

<p>In this task we want you to turn the first un-marked up list into an unordered list, and the second one into an ordered list.</p>

<p>Try updating the live code below to create the finished example:</p>

<h2 id="HTML_text_basics_3">HTML text basics 3</h2>

<p>In this task you are provided with a paragraph, and your aim is to use some inline elements to mark up a couple of appropriate words with strong importance, and a couple with emphasis.</p>

<p>Try updating the live code below to create the finished example:</p>

<p>{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/html/introduction-to-html/tasks/basic-text/basic-text3.html", '100%', 700)}}</p>

<h2 id="Assessment_or_further_help">Assessment or further help</h2>

<p>You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.</p>

<p>If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Put your work into an online shareable editor such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.</li>
 <li>Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the <a class="external external-icon" href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn" rel="noopener">MDN Discourse forum Learning category</a>. Your post should include:
  <ul>
   <li>A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for HTML text basics 1 skill test".</li>
   <li>Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.</li>
   <li>A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.</li>
   <li>A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
