The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand how to [mark up text in HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals) to give it structure and meaning.

> **Note:** You can try solutions in the interactive editors on this page or in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).

> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Task 1

In this task, we want you to mark up the provided HTML using semantic heading and paragraph elements.

The finished example should look like this:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/html/introduction-to-html/tasks/basic-text/basic-text1-finished.html", '100%', 300)}}

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:
