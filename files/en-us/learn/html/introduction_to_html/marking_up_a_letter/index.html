<p class="summary">We all learn to write a letter sooner or later; it is also a useful example to test our text formatting skills. In this assignment, you'll have a letter to mark up as a test for your HTML text formatting skills, as well as hyperlinks and proper use of the HTML <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element.</p>

<h2 id="Starting_point">Starting point</h2>

<p>To begin, get the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/introduction-to-html/marking-up-a-letter-start/letter-text.txt">raw text you need to mark up</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/introduction-to-html/marking-up-a-letter-start/css.txt">CSS to style the HTML</a>. Create a new <code>.html</code> file using your text editor or use an online tool such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to complete the tasks.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you get stuck, then ask us for help. See the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h2 id="Project_brief">Project brief</h2>

<p>For this project, your task is to mark up a letter that needs to be hosted on a university intranet. The letter is a response from a research fellow to a prospective PhD student concerning their application to the university.</p>

<h3 id="Blockstructural_semantics">Block/structural semantics</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Use appropriate document structure including doctype, and {{htmlelement("html")}}, {{htmlelement("head")}} and {{htmlelement("body")}} elements.</li>
 <li>In general, the letter should be marked up as an organization of headings and  paragraphs, with the following exception. There is one top level heading (the "Re:" line) and three second level headings.</li>
 <li>Use an appropriate list type to mark up the semester start dates, study subjects, and exotic dances.</li>
 <li>Put the two addresses inside {{htmlelement("address")}} elements. Each line of the address should sit on a new line, but not be in a new paragraph.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Inline_semantics">Inline semantics</h3>

<ul>
 <li>The names of the sender and receiver (and <em>Tel</em> and <em>Email</em>) should be marked up with strong importance.</li>
 <li>The four dates in the document should be have appropriate elements containing machine-readable dates.</li>
 <li>The first address and first date in the letter should have a class attribute value of <em>sender-column</em>. The CSS you'll add later will cause these to be right aligned, as it should be in the case in a classic letter layout.</li>
 <li>Mark up the following five acronyms/abbreviations in the main text of the letter — "PhD," "HTML," "CSS," "BC," and "Esq." — to provide expansions of each one.</li>
 <li>The six sub/superscripts should be marked up appropriately — in the chemical formulae,  and the numbers 103 and 104 (they should be 10 to the power of 3 and 4, respectively).</li>
 <li>Try to mark up at least two appropriate words in the text with strong importance/emphasis.</li>
 <li>There are two places where the letter should have a hyperlink. Add appropriate links with titles. For the location that the links point to, you may use http://example.com as the URL.</li>
 <li>Mark up the university motto quote and citation with appropriate elements.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="The_head_of_the_document">The head of the document</h3>

<ul>
 <li>The character set of the document should be set as utf-8 using the appropriate meta tag.</li>
 <li>The author of the letter should be specified in an appropriate meta tag.</li>
 <li>The provided CSS should be included inside an appropriate tag.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Hints_and_tips">Hints and tips</h2>

<ul>
 <li>Use the <a href="https://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML validator</a> to validate your HTML. Award yourself bonus points if it validates.</li>
 <li>You don't need to know any CSS to do this assignment.  You just need to put the provided CSS inside an HTML element.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>The following screenshot shows an example of what the letter might look like after being marked up.</p>

<h2 id="Assessment_or_further_help">Assessment or further help</h2>

<p>If you would like your work assessed, or if you get stuck and want to ask for help:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Put your work in an online shareable editor such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>.</li>
 <li>Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn">MDN Discourse forum Learning category</a>. Your post should include:
  <ul>
   <li>A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Marking up a letter".</li>
   <li>Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do (if you are stuck and need help, or if you want an assessment).</li>
   <li>A link to the example you want evaluated or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good habit to develop. It's very hard to help someone with a coding problem without seeing their code.</li>
   <li>A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can read the exact wording of the relevant question(s).</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
