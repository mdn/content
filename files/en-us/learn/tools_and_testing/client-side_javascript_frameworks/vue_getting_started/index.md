Now let's introduce Vue, the third of our frameworks. In this article we'll look at a little bit of Vue background, learn how to install it and create a new project, study the high-level structure of the whole project and an individual component, see how to run the project locally, and get it prepared to start building our example.

          Vue components are written as a combination of JavaScript objects that
          manage the app's data and an HTML-based template syntax that maps to
          the underlying DOM structure. For installation, and to use some of the
          more advanced features of Vue (like Single File Components or render
          functions), you'll need a terminal with node + npm installed.

> This tutorial targets [Vue version 3.4.21](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#3421-2024-02-28) using [`create-vue` 3.10.2](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue/releases/tag/v3.10.3) (with Node.js version `v20.11.0`) and was last revised in May 2024.

## A clearer Vue

Vue is a modern JavaScript framework that provides useful facilities for progressive enhancement — unlike many other frameworks, you can use Vue to enhance existing HTML. This lets you use Vue as a drop-in replacement for a library like [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

That being said, you can also use Vue to write entire Single Page Applications (SPAs). This allows you to create markup managed entirely by Vue, which can improve developer experience and performance when dealing with complex applications. It also allows you to take advantage of libraries for client-side routing and state management when you need to. Additionally, Vue takes a "middle ground" approach to tooling like client-side routing and state management. While the Vue core team maintains suggested libraries for these functions, they are not directly bundled into Vue. This allows you to select a different routing/state management library if they better fit your application.

In addition to allowing you to progressively integrate Vue into your applications, Vue also provides a progressive approach to writing markup. Like most frameworks, Vue lets you create reusable blocks of markup via components. Most of the time, Vue components are written using a special HTML template syntax. When you need more control than the HTML syntax allows, you can write JSX or plain JavaScript functions to define your components.

As you work through this tutorial, you might want to keep the [Vue guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) and [API documentation](https://vuejs.org/api/) open in other tabs, so you can refer to them if you want more information on any sub topic.

## Installation

To use Vue in an existing site, you can drop one of the following [`<script>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) elements onto a page. This allows you to start using Vue on existing sites, which is why Vue prides itself on being a progressive framework. This is a great option when migrating an existing project using a library like jQuery to Vue. With this method, you can use a lot of the core features of Vue, such as the attributes, custom components, and data-management.

- Development Script (not optimized, but includes console warnings which is great for development.)

  ```html
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.js"></script>
  ```

- Production Script (Optimized version, minimal console warnings. It is recommended that you specify a version number when including Vue on your site so that any framework updates do not break your live site without you knowing.)

  ```html
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@3/dist/vue.global.prod.js"></script>
  ```

However, this approach has some limitations. To build more complex apps, you'll want to use the [Vue npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue). This will let you use advanced features of Vue and use tools like Vite or WebPack. To make building apps with Vue easier, there is a CLI scaffolding tool [create-vue](https://github.com/vuejs/create-vue) to streamline the development process. To use `create-vue` you will need:

1. Node.js 20 installed.
2. [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

> **Note:** If you don't have the above installed, find out [more about installing npm and Node.js](/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line#adding_powerups) here.

To install Vue and initialize a new project, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm create vue@latest
```

Or if you'd prefer to use yarn:

```bash
yarn create vue@latest
```

This command will give you a list of project configurations you can use. There are a few defaults, but you may pick your own project-specific settings. These options let you configure things like TypeScript, linting, vue-router, testing, and more.
We'll step through the options in the initialization steps below.

## Initializing a new project

To explore various features of Vue, we will be building up a sample todo list app. We'll begin by using `create-vue` to build a new scaffold for our app.
In terminal, `cd` to where you'd like to create your sample app, then run `npm create vue@latest` (or `yarn create vue@latest` if you prefer Yarn).

The interactive tool let's you choose some options and you can procees by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
For this project, we'll use the following configuration:

```plain
✔ Project name: … todo-vue
✔ Add TypeScript? … No
✔ Add JSX Support? … No
✔ Add Vue Router for Single Page Application development? … No
✔ Add Pinia for state management? … No
✔ Add Vitest for Unit Testing? … No
✔ Add an End-to-End Testing Solution? › No
✔ Add ESLint for code quality? … Yes
? Add Prettier for code formatting? › Yes
```

After choosing these options, your project structure is now configured and dependencies are defined in a `package.json` file.
The next steps are to install the dependencies and start the server, and the tool conveniently prints out the commands you need to do this:

```plain
Scaffolding project in /path/to/todo-vue...

Done. Now run:

  cd todo-vue
  npm install
  npm run format
  npm run dev
```

## Project structure

If everything went successfully, the CLI should have created a series of files and directories for your project. The most significant ones are as follows:

- `package.json`: This file contains the list of dependencies for your project, as well as some metadata and `eslint` configuration.
- `yarn.lock`: If you chose `yarn` as your package manager, this file will be generated with a list of all the dependencies and sub-dependencies that your project needs.
- `jsconfig.json`: This is a config file for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig) and gives context for VS Code on your project structure and assists auto-completion.
- `vite.config.js`: This is the configuration file for the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) development server that builds and serves your project on your local machine.
  The Vite server watches source files for changes and can hot-reload the project while you make changes.
- `public`: This directory contains static assets that are published during build.
  - `favicon.ico`: This is the favicon for your app. Currently, it's the Vue logo.
- `index.html`: Your Vue app is run from this HTML page.
- `src`: This directory contains the core of your Vue app.

  - `main.js`: this is the entry point to your application. Currently, this file initializes your Vue application and signifies which HTML element in the `index.html` file your app should be attached to. This file is often where you register global components or additional Vue libraries.
  - `App.vue`: this is the top-level component in your Vue app. See below for more explanation of Vue components.
  - `components`: this directory is where you keep your components. Currently, it just has one example component.
  - `assets`: this directory is for storing static assets like CSS and images. Because these files are in the source directory, they can be processed by Webpack. This means you can use pre-processors like [Sass/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) or [Stylus](https://stylus-lang.com/).

> **Note:** Depending on the options you select when creating a new project, there might be other directories present (for example, if you choose a router, you will also have a `views` directory).

## .vue files (single file components)

Like in many front-end frameworks, components are a central part of building apps in Vue. These components let you break a large application into discrete building blocks that can be created and managed separately, and transfer data between each other as required. These small blocks can help you reason about and test your code.

While some frameworks encourage you to separate your template, logic, and styling code into separate files, Vue takes the opposite approach. Using [Single File Components (SFC)](https://vuejs.org/guide/scaling-up/sfc.html), Vue lets you group your templates, corresponding script, and CSS all together in a single file ending in `.vue`. These files are processed by a JS build tool (such as Vite or Webpack), which means you can take advantage of build-time tooling in your project. This allows you to use tools like Babel, TypeScript, SCSS and more to create more sophisticated components.

Let's look inside the `src` folder in the project we created with the CLI and inspect your first `.vue` file: `App.vue`.

### App.vue

Open your `App.vue` file — you'll see that it has three parts: `<template>`, `<script>`, and `<style>`, which contain the component's template, scripting, and styling information. All Single File Components share this same basic structure.

`<template>` contains all the markup structure and display logic of your component. Your template can contain any valid HTML, as well as some Vue-specific syntax that we'll cover later.

> **Note:** By setting the `lang` attribute on the `<template>` tag, you can use Pug template syntax instead of standard HTML — `<template lang="pug">`. We'll stick to standard HTML through this tutorial, but it is worth knowing that this is possible.

`<script>` contains all of the non-display logic of your component. Most importantly, your `<script>` tag is where you locally register components, define component inputs (props), handle local state, define methods, and more. Your build step will process this object and transform it (with your template) into a Vue component with a `render()` function.

In the case of `App.vue`, two components `TheWelcome` and `HelloWorld` are registered by means of imports. When you register a component in this way, you're registering it locally. Locally registered components can only be used inside the components that register them, so you need to import and register them in every component file that uses them. This is useful for {{Glossary("Tree shaking")}} (not loading unused code) and bundle splitting (only loading code when needed) because not every page in your app necessarily needs every component.

```vue
<script setup>
import HelloWorld from "./components/HelloWorld.vue";
import TheWelcome from "./components/TheWelcome.vue";
</script>
```

> **Note:** If you want to use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) syntax, you need to set the `lang` attribute on the `<script>` tag to signify to the compiler that you're using TypeScript — `<script lang="ts">`.

`<style>` is where you write your CSS for the component. If you add a `scoped` attribute — `<style scoped>` — Vue will scope the styles to the contents of your SFC. This works similar to CSS-in-JS solutions, but allows you to just write plain CSS.

> **Note:** If you select a CSS pre-processor when creating the project via the CLI, you can add a `lang` attribute to the `<style>` tag so that the contents can be processed at build time. For example, `<style lang="scss">` will allow you to use SCSS syntax in your styling information.

## Running the app locally

The `create-vue` tool comes with Vite as a built-in development server. This allows you to run your app locally so you can test it easily without needing to configure a server from scratch. The CLI adds commands to the project's `package.json` file as npm scripts so you can easily run them.

In your terminal, try running `npm run dev` (or `yarn dev` if you prefer yarn). Your terminal should output something like the following:

```plain
  VITE v5.0.11  ready in 312 ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

If you navigate to the "localhost" address in a new browser tab you should see your app (this address should be `http://localhost:5173/` as stated above, but may vary based on your setup). Right now, the app should contain a welcome message, a link to the Vue documentation, links to the plugins you added when you initialized the app with your CLI, and some other useful links to the Vue community and ecosystem.

## Making a couple of changes

Let's make our first change to the app — we'll delete the Vue logo. Open the `App.vue` file, and delete the [`<img>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) element from the template section:

```vue
<img
  alt="Vue logo"
  class="logo"
  src="./assets/logo.svg"
  width="125"
  height="125" />
```

If your server is still running, you should see the logo removed from the rendered site almost instantly. Let's also remove the `HelloWorld` component from our template.

First of all delete this line:

```vue
<HelloWorld msg="You did it!" />
```

If you save your `App.vue` file now, your editor may show an error because we've registered the `HelloWorld` component but are not using it. We also need to remove the lines from inside the `<script>` element that import and register the component:

Delete these lines now:

```js
import HelloWorld from "./components/HelloWorld.vue";
```

If you remove everything inside the `<template>` tag, you'll see an error saying `The template requires child element` in your editor.
You can fix this by adding some content inside the `<template>` tag and we can start with a new `<h1>` element inside a `<div>`.
Since we're going to be creating a todo list app below, let's set our heading to "To-Do List" like so:

```vue
<template>
  <div id="app">
    <h1>To-Do List</h1>
  </div>
</template>
```

`App.vue` will now show our heading, as you'd expect.

## Summary

Let's leave this here for now. We've learned about some of the ideas behind Vue, created some scaffolding for our example app to live inside, inspected it, and made a few preliminary changes.

With a basic introduction out of the way, we'll now go further and build up our sample app, a basic Todo list application that allows us to store a list of items, check them off when done, and filter the list by all, complete, and incomplete tasks.

In the next article we'll build our first custom component, and look at some important concepts such as passing props into it and saving its data state.
