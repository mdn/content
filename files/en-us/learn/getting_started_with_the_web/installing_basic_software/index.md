In _Installing basic software_, we show you what tools you need to do simple web development and how to install them properly.

## What tools do I actually need, right now?

In this article, we'll set you up with the bare minimum — a text editor and some modern web browsers.

### Installing a text editor

You probably already have a basic text editor on your computer. By default Windows includes [Notepad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad) and macOS comes with [TextEdit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TextEdit). Linux distros vary; Ubuntu comes with [gedit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedit) by default.

For web development, you can probably do better than Notepad or TextEdit. We recommend starting with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is a free editor, that offers live previews and code hints.

### Installing modern web browsers

For now, we'll install a couple of desktop web browsers to test our code in. Choose your operating system below and click the relevant links to download installers for your favorite browsers:

- Linux: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), [Brave](https://brave.com).
- Windows: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge), [Brave](https://brave.com) (Windows 10 comes with Edge by default; otherwise, you should install an alternative browser).
- macOS: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), [Brave](https://brave.com) (macOS and iOS come with Safari by default).

Before going on, you should install at least two of these browsers and have them ready for testing.

### Installing a local web server

Some examples will need to be run by a web server to work successfully. You can find out how to do this in [How do you set up a local testing server?](/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)

## What tools do the professionals use?

The following looks like a scary list, but fortunately, you can get started in web development without knowing anything about most of these.

- **A computer**. Maybe that sounds obvious to some people, but some of you are reading this article on your phone or a library computer. For serious web development, it's better to invest in a desktop or laptop computer running Windows, macOS or Linux.
- **A text editor**, to write code in. This could be a text editor (e.g. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), or [VIM](https://www.vim.org/)), or a hybrid editor (e.g. [Dreamweaver](https://www.adobe.com/products/dreamweaver.html) or [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/)). Office document editors are not suitable for this use, as they rely on hidden elements that interfere with the rendering engines used by web browsers.
- **Web browsers**, to test code in. Currently, the most-used browsers are [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Opera](https://www.opera.com/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), [Internet Explorer](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/internet-explorer-downloads-d49e1f0d-571c-9a7b-d97e-be248806ca70) and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge). You should also test how your site performs on mobile devices and on any old browsers your target audience may still be using (such as IE 8–10). [Lynx](https://lynx.browser.org/), a text-based terminal web browser, is great for seeing how your site is experienced by visually-impaired users.
- **A graphics editor**, like [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [Paint.NET](https://www.getpaint.net/), [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html), [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com) or [XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html), to make images or graphics for your web pages.
- **A version control system**, to manage files on servers, collaborate on a project with a team, share code and assets and avoid editing conflicts. Right now, [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is the most popular version control system along with the [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) hosting service.
- **An FTP program**, used on older web hosting accounts to manage files on servers ([Git](https://git-scm.com/) is increasingly replacing FTP for this purpose). There are loads of (S)FTP programs available including [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/), [Fetch](https://fetchsoftworks.com/) and [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).
- **An automation system,** like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com/), or [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) to automatically perform repetitive tasks, such as minifying code and running tests.
- Libraries, frameworks, etc., to speed up writing common functionality. A library tends to be an existing JavaScript or CSS file that provides ready-rolled functionality for you to make use of in your code. A framework tends to take this idea further, offering a complete system with some custom syntaxes for you to write a web app on top of.
- More tools besides!
