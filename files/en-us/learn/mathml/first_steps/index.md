MathML is the markup language used to write mathematical formulas in web pages. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards MathML mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it inside HTML.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:

1. Basic familiarity with using computers and using the Web passively (i.e. looking at it, consuming the content.)
2. A basic work environment set up, as detailed in [Installing basic software](/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Installing_basic_software), and an understanding of how to create and manage files, as detailed in [Dealing with files](/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/Dealing_with_files).
3. Basic familiarity with HTML, as described in [Introduction to HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML).

> **Note:** If you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you could try out the code examples in an online coding program such as [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/) or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).

## Guides

This module contains the following articles, which will take you through all the basic theory of MathML, and provide opportunities for you to test out some skills.

- [Getting started with MathML](/en-US/docs/Learn/MathML/First_steps/Getting_started)
  - : In this article, we will take a simple HTML document and see how to add MathML formulas into it, introducing a few elements along the way.
- [Text containers](/en-US/docs/Learn/MathML/First_steps/Text_containers)
  - : Now that you get a better idea of MathML, we move on to text containers (variables, numbers, operators, ...) which are used as building blocks of MathML formulas.
- [Fractions and roots](/en-US/docs/Learn/MathML/First_steps/Fractions_and_roots)
  - : Relying on text containers, this article describes how to build more complex MathML expressions by nesting fractions and roots.
- [Scripts](/en-US/docs/Learn/MathML/First_steps/Scripts)
  - : We continue the review of basic math notations and focuses on building MathML elements with scripts.
- [Tables](/en-US/docs/Learn/MathML/First_steps/Tables)
  - : Once all basic math notations are known, it remains to consider tabular layout which can be used for matrix-like expressions and other advanced math layout.

## Assessments

The following assessment will test your understanding of the MathML basics covered in the guides above.

- [Three famous mathematical formulas](/en-US/docs/Learn/MathML/First_steps/Three_famous_mathematical_formulas)
  - : With the things you have learned in the last few articles, you should already be able to write relatively sophisticated MathML formulas. This assessment gives you a chance to do that.
