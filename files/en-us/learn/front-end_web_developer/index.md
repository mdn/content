Welcome to our front-end web developer learning pathway!

Here we provide you with a structured course that will teach you all you need to know to become a front-end web developer. Work through each section, learning new skills (or improving existing ones) as you go along. Each section includes exercises and assessments to test your understanding before you move forward.

## Subjects covered

The subjects covered are:

- Basic setup and learning how to learn
- Web standards and best practices (such as accessibility and cross-browser compatibility)
- HTML, the language that gives web content structure and meaning
- CSS, the language used to style web pages
- JavaScript, the scripting language used to create dynamic functionality on the web
- Tooling that is used to facilitate modern client-side web development.

You can work through sections in order, but each one is also self-contained. For example, if you already know HTML, you can skip ahead to the CSS section.

## Prerequisites

You don't need any previous knowledge to start this course. All you need is a computer that can run modern web browsers, an internet connection, and a willingness to learn.

If you are not sure if front-end web development is for you, and/or you want a gentle introduction before starting a longer and more complete course, work through our [Getting started with the web](/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web) module first.

## Getting help

We have tried to make learning front-end web development as comfortable as possible, but you will probably still get stuck because you don't understand something, or some code is just not working.

Don't panic. We all get stuck, whether we are beginner or professional web developers. The [Learning and getting help](/en-US/docs/Learn/Learning_and_getting_help) article provides you with a series of tips for looking up information and helping yourself. If you are still stuck, feel free to post a question on our [Discourse forum](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn/250).

Let's get started. Good luck!
