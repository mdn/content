<p class="summary">Now that we've looked at the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript, we'll test your knowledge of loops, functions, conditionals and events by getting you to build a fairly common item you'll see on a lot of websites — a JavaScript-powered image gallery.</p>

<h2 id="Starting_point">Starting point</h2>

<p>To get this assessment started, you should go and <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/javascript/building-blocks/gallery/gallery-start.zip?raw=true">grab the ZIP</a> file for the example, unzip it somewhere on your computer, and do the exercise locally to begin with.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could use a site like <a class="external external-icon" href="https://jsbin.com/">JSBin</a> or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to do your assessment. You could paste the HTML, CSS and JavaScript into one of these online editors. If the online editor you are using doesn't have separate JavaScript/CSS panels, feel free to put them inline <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>/<code>&lt;style&gt;</code> elements inside the HTML page.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h2 id="Project_brief">Project brief</h2>

<p>You have been provided with some HTML, CSS and image assets and a few lines of JavaScript code; you need to write the necessary JavaScript to turn this into a working program. The HTML body looks like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: html">&lt;h1&gt;Image gallery example&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;div class="full-img"&gt;
  &lt;img class="displayed-img" src="images/pic1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;div class="overlay"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;button class="dark"&gt;Darken&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="thumb-bar"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;</pre>

<p>The example looks like this:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="gallery.png" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;"></p>

<p>The most interesting parts of the example's CSS file:</p>

<ul>
 <li>It absolutely positions the three elements inside the <code>full-img &lt;div&gt;</code> — the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> in which the full-sized image is displayed, an empty <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> that is sized to be the same size as the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> and put right over the top of it (this is used to apply a darkening effect to the image via a semi-transparent background color), and a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> that is used to control the darkening effect.</li>
 <li>It sets the width of any images inside the <code>thumb-bar &lt;div&gt;</code> (so-called "thumbnail" images) to 20%, and floats them to the left so they sit next to one another on a line.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your JavaScript needs to:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Loop through all the images, and for each one insert an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element inside the <code>thumb-bar &lt;div&gt;</code> that embeds that image in the page.</li>
 <li>Attach an <code>onclick</code> handler to each <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> inside the <code>thumb-bar &lt;div&gt;</code> so that when they are clicked, the corresponding image is displayed in the <code>displayed-img &lt;img&gt;</code> element.</li>
 <li>Attach an <code>onclick</code> handler to the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> so that when it is clicked, a darken effect is applied to the full-size image. When it is clicked again, the darken effect is removed again.</li>
</ul>

<p>To give you more of an idea, have a look at the <a href="https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/javascript/building-blocks/gallery/">finished example</a> (no peeking at the source code!)</p>

<h2 id="Steps_to_complete">Steps to complete</h2>

<p>The following sections describe what you need to do.</p>

<h3 id="Looping_through_the_images">Looping through the images</h3>

<p>We've already provided you with lines that store a reference to the <code>thumb-bar &lt;div&gt;</code> inside a constant called <code>thumbBar</code>, create a new <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, set its <code>src</code> attribute to a placeholder value <code>xxx</code>, and append this new <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element inside <code>thumbBar</code>.</p>

<p>You need to:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Put the section of code below the "Looping through images" comment inside a loop that loops through all 5 images — you just need to loop through five numbers, one representing each image.</li>
 <li>In each loop iteration, replace the <code>xxx</code> placeholder value with a string that will equal the path to the image in each case. We are setting the value of the <code>src</code> attribute to this value in each case. Bear in mind that in each case, the image is inside the images directory and its name is <code>pic1.jpg</code>, <code>pic2.jpg</code>, etc.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Adding_an_onclick_handler_to_each_thumbnail_image">Adding an onclick handler to each thumbnail image</h3>

<p>In each loop iteration, you need to add an <code>onclick</code> handler to the current <code>newImage</code> — this handler should find the value of the <code>src</code> attribute of the current image. Set the <code>src</code> attribute value of the <code>displayed-img &lt;img&gt;</code> to the <code>src</code> value passed in as a parameter.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can add one event listener to the thumb bar.</p>

<h3 id="Writing_a_handler_that_runs_the_darkenlighten_button">Writing a handler that runs the darken/lighten button</h3>

<p>That just leaves our darken/lighten <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> — we've already provided a line that stores a reference to the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> in a constant called <code>btn</code>. You need to add an <code>onclick</code> handler that:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Checks the current class name set on the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> — you can again achieve this by using <code>getAttribute()</code>.</li>
 <li>If the class name is <code>"dark"</code>, changes the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> class to <code>"light"</code> (using <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/setAttribute">setAttribute()</a></code>), its text content to "Lighten", and the {{cssxref("background-color")}} of the overlay <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to <code>"rgba(0,0,0,0.5)"</code>.</li>
 <li>If the class name is not <code>"dark"</code>, changes the <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> class to <code>"dark"</code>, its text content back to "Darken", and the {{cssxref("background-color")}} of the overlay <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> to <code>"rgba(0,0,0,0)"</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>The following lines provide a basis for achieving the changes stipulated in points 2 and 3 above.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">btn.setAttribute('class', xxx);
btn.textContent = xxx;
overlay.style.backgroundColor = xxx;</pre>

<h2 id="Hints_and_tips">Hints and tips</h2>

<ul>
 <li>You don't need to edit the HTML or CSS in any way.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Assessment_or_further_help">Assessment or further help</h2>

<p>If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Put your work into an online shareable editor such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>.</li>
 <li>Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn">MDN Discourse forum Learning category</a>. Your post should include:
  <ul>
   <li>A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Image gallery".</li>
   <li>Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.</li>
   <li>A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.</li>
   <li>A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
