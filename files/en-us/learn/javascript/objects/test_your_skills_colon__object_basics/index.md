The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our [JavaScript object basics](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics) article.

> **Note:** You can try solutions in the interactive editors on this page or in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).
> If there is an error in your code, it will be logged into the results panel on this page or in the JavaScript console.
>
> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Object basics 1

In this task you are provided with an object literal, and your tasks are to

- Store the value of the `name` property inside the `catName` variable, using bracket notation.
- Run the `greeting()` method using dot notation (it will log the greeting to the browser's console).
- Update the `color` property value to `black`.

## Object basics 2

In our next task, we want you to have a go at creating your own object literal to represent one of your favorite bands. The required properties are:

- `name`: A string representing the band name.
- `nationality`: A string representing the country the band comes from.
- `genre`: What type of music the band plays.
- `members`: A number representing the number of members the band has.
- `formed`: A number representing the year the band formed.
- `split`: A number representing the year the band split up, or `false` if they are still together.
- `albums`: An array representing the albums released by the band. Each array item should be an object containing the following members:

  - `name`: A string representing the name of the album.
  - `released`: A number representing the year the album was released.

Include at least two albums in the `albums` array.

Once you've done this, you should then write a string to the variable `bandInfo`, which will contain a small biography detailing their name, nationality, years active, and style, and the title and release date of their first album.

## Object basics 3

In this task, we want you to return to the `cat` object literal from Task 1. We want you to rewrite the `greeting()` method so that it logs `"Hello, said Bertie the Cymric."` to the browser's console, but in a way that will work across _any_ cat object of the same structure, regardless of its name or breed.

When you are done, write your own object called `cat2`, which has the same structure, exactly the same `greeting()` method, but a different `name`, `breed`, and `color`.

Call both `greeting()` methods to check that they log appropriate greetings to the console.

## Object basics 4

In the code you wrote for Task 3, the `greeting()` method is defined twice, once for each cat. This isn't ideal (specifically, it violates a principle in programming sometimes called [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) or "Don't Repeat Yourself").

In this task we want you to improve the code so `greeting()` is only defined once, and every `cat` instance gets its own `greeting()` method. Hint: you should use a JavaScript constructor to create `cat` instances.
