The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our [Working with JSON](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON) article.

> **Note:** You can try solutions by downloading the code and putting it in an online an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).
> If there is an error, it will be logged in the results panel on the page or into the browser's JavaScript console to help you.

## JSON 1

The one and only task in this article concerns accessing JSON data and using it in your page. JSON data about some mother cats and their kittens is available in [sample.json](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/javascript/oojs/tasks/json/sample.json). The JSON is loaded into the page as a text string and made available in the `catString` parameter of the `displayCatInfo()` function. Your task is to fill in the missing parts of the `displayCatInfo()` function to store:

- The names of the three mother cats, separated by commas, in the `motherInfo` variable.
- The total number of kittens, and how many are male and female, in the `kittenInfo` variable.

The values of these variables are then printed to the screen inside paragraphs.

Some hints/questions:

- The JSON data is provided as text inside the `displayCatInfo()` function. You'll need to parse it into JSON before you can get any data out of it.
- You'll probably want to use an outer loop to loop through the cats and add their names to the `motherInfo` variable string, and an inner loop to loop through all the kittens, add up the total of all/male/female kittens, and add those details to the `kittenInfo` variable string.
- The last mother cat name should have an "and" before it, and a full stop after it. How do you make sure this can work, no matter how many cats are in the JSON?
- Why are the `para1.textContent = motherInfo;` and `para2.textContent = kittenInfo;` lines inside the `displayCatInfo()` function, and not at the end of the script? This has something to do with async code.
