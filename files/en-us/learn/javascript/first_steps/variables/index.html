<p class="summary">After reading the last couple of articles you should now know what JavaScript is, what it can do for you, how you use it alongside other web technologies, and what its main features look like from a high level. In this article, we will get down to the real basics, looking at how to work with the most basic building blocks of JavaScript — Variables.</p>

<h2 id="Tools_you_need">Tools you need</h2>

<p>Throughout this article, you'll be asked to type in lines of code to test your understanding of the content. If you are using a desktop browser, the best place to type your sample code is your browser's JavaScript console (see <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_are_browser_developer_tools">What are browser developer tools</a> for more information on how to access this tool).</p>


<h2>What is a variable?</h2>

<p>A variable is a container for a value, like a number we might use in a sum, or a string that we might use as part of a sentence. Let's look at a simple example:</p>

<div id="example_with_variabele">
    <pre class="brush: html">
    &lt;button id="button_A"&gt;Press me&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;h3 id="heading_A"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
    </pre>

    <pre class="brush: js">
    const buttonA = document.querySelector('#button_A');
    const headingA = document.querySelector('#heading_A');
    
    buttonA.onclick = function() {
      let name = prompt('What is your name?');
      alert('Hello ' + name + ', nice to see you!');
      headingA.textContent = 'Welcome ' + name;
    }</pre>
    
    <p>{{ EmbedLiveSample('example_with_variabele', '100%', 50, "", "", "hide-codepen-jsfiddle") }}</p>
</div>

<p>In this example pressing the button runs some code. The first line pops a box up on the screen that asks the reader to enter their name, and then stores the value in a variable. The second line displays a welcome message that includes their name, taken from the variable value and the third line displays that name on the page.</p>

<p>To understand why this is so useful, let's think about how we'd write this example without using a variable. It would end up looking something like this:</p>


<div id="example_without_variable">

    <pre class="brush: html example-bad">
    &lt;button id="button_B"&gt;Press me&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;h3 id="heading_B"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
    </pre>

    <pre class="brush: js example-bad">
    const buttonB = document.querySelector('#button_B');
    const headingB = document.querySelector('#heading_B');
    
    buttonB.onclick = function() {
        alert('Hello ' + prompt('What is your name?') + ', nice to see you!');
        headingB.textContent = 'Welcome ' + prompt('What is your name?');
    }</pre>
    
    <p>{{ EmbedLiveSample('example_without_variable', '100%', 50, "", "", "hide-codepen-jsfiddle") }}</p>
</div>


<p>You may not fully understand the syntax we are using (yet!), but you should be able to get the idea. If we didn't have variables available, we'd have to ask the reader for their name every time we needed to use it!</p>

<p>Variables just make sense, and as you learn more about JavaScript they will start to become second nature.</p>

<p>One special thing about variables is that they can contain just about anything — not just strings and numbers. Variables can also contain complex data and even entire functions to do amazing things. You'll learn more about this as you go along.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: We say variables contain values. This is an important distinction to make. Variables aren't the values themselves; they are containers for values. You can think of them being like little cardboard boxes that you can store things in.</p>
</div>

<p><img alt="" src="boxes.png" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto;"></p>

<h2 id="Declaring_a_variable">Declaring a variable</h2>

<p>To use a variable, you've first got to create it — more accurately, we call this declaring the variable. To do this, we type the keyword <code>var</code> or <code>let</code> followed by the name you want to call your variable:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">let myName;
let myAge;</pre>

<p>Here we're creating two variables called <code>myName</code> and <code>myAge</code>. Try typing these lines into your web browser's console. After that, try creating a variable (or two) with your own name choices.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: In JavaScript, all code instructions should end with a semi-colon (<code>;</code>) — your code may work correctly for single lines, but probably won't when you are writing multiple lines of code together. Try to get into the habit of including it.</p>
</div>

<p>You can test whether these values now exist in the execution environment by typing just the variable's name, e.g.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">myName;
myAge;</pre>

<p>They currently have no value; they are empty containers. When you enter the variable names, you should get a value of <code>undefined</code> returned. If they don't exist, you'll get an error message — try typing in</p>

<pre class="brush: js">scoobyDoo;</pre>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Don't confuse a variable that exists but has no defined value with a variable that doesn't exist at all — they are very different things. In the box analogy you saw above, not existing would mean there's no box (variable) for a value to go in. No value defined would mean that there IS a box, but it has no value inside it.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Initializing_a_variable">Initializing a variable</h2>

<p>Once you've declared a variable, you can initialize it with a value. You do this by typing the variable name, followed by an equals sign (<code>=</code>), followed by the value you want to give it. For example:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">myName = 'Chris';
myAge = 37;</pre>

<p>Try going back to the console now and typing in these lines. You should see the value you've assigned to the variable returned in the console to confirm it, in each case. Again, you can return your variable values by typing their name into the console — try these again:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">myName;
myAge;</pre>

<p>You can declare and initialize a variable at the same time, like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">let myDog = 'Rover';</pre>

<p>This is probably what you'll do most of the time, as it is quicker than doing the two actions on two separate lines.</p>

<h2 id="The_difference_between_var_and_let">The difference between var and let</h2>

<p>At this point you may be thinking "why do we need two keywords for defining variables?? Why have <code>var</code> <em>and</em> <code>let</code>?".</p>

<p>The reasons are somewhat historical. Back when JavaScript was first created, there was only <code>var</code>. This works basically fine in most cases, but it has some issues in the way it works — its design can sometimes be confusing or downright annoying. So, <code>let</code> was created in modern versions of JavaScript, a new keyword for creating variables that works somewhat differently to <code>var</code>, fixing its issues in the process.</p>

<p>A couple of simple differences are explained below. We won't go into all the differences now, but you'll start to discover them as you learn more about JavaScript (if you really want to read about them now, feel free to check out our <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let">let reference page</a>).</p>

<p>For a start, if you write a multiline JavaScript program that declares and initializes a variable, you can actually declare a variable with <code>var</code> after you initialize it and it will still work. For example:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">myName = 'Chris';

function logName() {
  console.log(myName);
}

logName();

var myName;</pre>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This won't work when typing individual lines into a JavaScript console, just when running multiple lines of JavaScript in a web document.</p>
</div>

<p>This works because of <strong>hoisting</strong> — read <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var#var_hoisting">var hoisting</a> for more detail on the subject.</p>

<p>Hoisting no longer works with <code>let</code>. If we changed <code>var</code> to <code>let</code> in the above example, it would fail with an error. This is a good thing — declaring a variable after you initialize it results in confusing, harder to understand code.</p>

<p>Secondly, when you use <code>var</code>, you can declare the same variable as many times as you like, but with <code>let</code> you can't. The following would work:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var myName = 'Chris';
var myName = 'Bob';</pre>

<p>But the following would throw an error on the second line:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">let myName = 'Chris';
let myName = 'Bob';</pre>

<p>You'd have to do this instead:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">let myName = 'Chris';
myName = 'Bob';</pre>

<p>Again, this is a sensible language decision. There is no reason to redeclare variables — it just makes things more confusing.</p>

<p>For these reasons and more, we recommend that you use <code>let</code> as much as possible in your code, rather than <code>var</code>. There is no reason to use <code>var</code>, unless you need to support old versions of Internet Explorer with your code (it doesn't support <code>let</code> until version 11; the modern Microsoft Edge browser supports <code>let</code> just fine).</p>

<h2 id="Updating_a_variable">Updating a variable</h2>

<p>Once a variable has been initialized with a value, you can change (or update) that value by giving it a different value. Try entering the following lines into your console:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">myName = 'Bob';
myAge = 40;</pre>

<h3 id="An_aside_on_variable_naming_rules">An aside on variable naming rules</h3>

<p>You can call a variable pretty much anything you like, but there are limitations. Generally, you should stick to just using Latin characters (0-9, a-z, A-Z) and the underscore character.</p>

<ul>
 <li>You shouldn't use other characters because they may cause errors or be hard to understand for an international audience.</li>
 <li>Don't use underscores at the start of variable names — this is used in certain JavaScript constructs to mean specific things, so may get confusing.</li>
 <li>Don't use numbers at the start of variables. This isn't allowed and causes an error.</li>
 <li>A safe convention to stick to is so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase#Variations_and_synonyms">"lower camel case"</a>, where you stick together multiple words, using lower case for the whole first word and then capitalize subsequent words. We've been using this for our variable names in the article so far.</li>
 <li>Make variable names intuitive, so they describe the data they contain. Don't just use single letters/numbers, or big long phrases.</li>
 <li>Variables are case sensitive — so <code>myage</code> is a different variable from <code>myAge</code>.</li>
 <li>One last point: you also need to avoid using JavaScript reserved words as your variable names — by this, we mean the words that make up the actual syntax of JavaScript! So, you can't use words like <code>var</code>, <code>function</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>for</code> as variable names. Browsers recognize them as different code items, and so you'll get errors.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can find a fairly complete list of reserved keywords to avoid at <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#keywords">Lexical grammar — keywords</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>Good name examples:</p>

<pre class="example-good">age
myAge
init
initialColor
finalOutputValue

<p>Try creating a few more variables now, with the above guidance in mind.</p>

<h2 id="Variable_types">Variable types</h2>

<p>There are a few different types of data we can store in variables. In this section we'll describe these in brief, then in future articles, you'll learn about them in more detail.</p>

<p>So far we've looked at the first two, but there are others.</p>

<h3 id="Numbers">Numbers</h3>

<p>You can store numbers in variables, either whole numbers like 30 (also called integers) or decimal numbers like 2.456 (also called floats or floating point numbers). You don't need to declare variable types in JavaScript, unlike some other programming languages. When you give a variable a number value, you don't include quotes:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">let myAge = 17;</pre>

<h3 id="Strings">Strings</h3>

<p>Strings are pieces of text. When you give a variable a string value, you need to wrap it in single or double quote marks; otherwise, JavaScript tries to interpret it as another variable name.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">let dolphinGoodbye = 'So long and thanks for all the fish';</pre>

<h3 id="Booleans">Booleans</h3>

<p>Booleans are true/false values — they can have two values, <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. These are generally used to test a condition, after which code is run as appropriate. So for example, a simple case would be:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">let iAmAlive = true;</pre>

<p>Whereas in reality it would be used more like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">let test = 6 &lt; 3;</pre>

<p>This is using the "less than" operator (<code>&lt;</code>) to test whether 6 is less than 3. As you might expect, it returns <code>false</code>, because 6 is not less than 3! You will learn a lot more about such operators later on in the course.</p>

<h3 id="Arrays">Arrays</h3>

<p>An array is a single object that contains multiple values enclosed in square brackets and separated by commas. Try entering the following lines into your console:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">let myNameArray = ['Chris', 'Bob', 'Jim'];
let myNumberArray = [10, 15, 40];</pre>

<p>Once these arrays are defined, you can access each value by their location within the array. Try these lines:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">myNameArray[0]; // should return 'Chris'
myNumberArray[2]; // should return 40</pre>

<p>The square brackets specify an index value corresponding to the position of the value you want returned. You might have noticed that arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed: the first element is at index 0.</p>

<p>You'll learn a lot more about arrays in <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Arrays">a future article</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Objects">Objects</h3>

<p>In programming, an object is a structure of code that models a real-life object. You can have a simple object that represents a box and contains information about its width, length, and height, or you could have an object that represents a person, and contains data about their name, height, weight, what language they speak, how to say hello to them, and more.</p>

<p>Try entering the following line into your console:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">let dog = { name : 'Spot', breed : 'Dalmatian' };</pre>

<p>To retrieve the information stored in the object, you can use the following syntax:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">dog.name</pre>

<p>We won't be looking at objects any more for now — you can learn more about those in <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects">a future module</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Dynamic_typing">Dynamic typing</h2>

<p>JavaScript is a "dynamically typed language", which means that, unlike some other languages, you don't need to specify what data type a variable will contain (numbers, strings, arrays, etc).</p>

<p>For example, if you declare a variable and give it a value enclosed in quotes, the browser treats the variable as a string:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">let myString = 'Hello';</pre>

<p>Even if the value contains numbers, it is still a string, so be careful:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">let myNumber = '500'; // oops, this is still a string
typeof myNumber;
myNumber = 500; // much better — now this is a number
typeof myNumber;</pre>

<p>Try entering the four lines above into your console one by one, and see what the results are. You'll notice that we are using a special operator called <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof">typeof</a></code> — this returns the data type of the variable you type after it. The first time it is called, it should return <code>string</code>, as at that point the <code>myNumber</code> variable contains a string, <code>'500'</code>. Have a look and see what it returns the second time you call it.</p>

<h2 id="Constants_in_JavaScript">Constants in JavaScript</h2>

<p>Many programming languages have the concept of a <em>constant</em> — a value that once declared can't be changed. There are many reasons why you'd want to do this, from security (if a third party script changed such values it could cause problems) to debugging and code comprehension (it is harder to accidentally change values that shouldn't be changed and mess things up).</p>

<p>In the early days of JavaScript, constants didn't exist. In modern JavaScript, we have the keyword <code>const</code>, which lets us store values that can never be changed:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">const daysInWeek = 7;
const hoursInDay = 24;</pre>

<p><code>const</code> works in exactly the same way as <code>let</code>, except that you can't give a <code>const</code> a new value. In the following example, the second line would throw an error:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">const daysInWeek = 7;
daysInWeek = 8;</pre>
