The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our [Storing the information you need — Variables](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables) article.

> **Note:** You can try solutions in the interactive editors on this page or in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).
> If there is an error in your code, it will be logged into the results panel on this page or in the JavaScript console.
>
> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Variables 1

In this task we want you to:

- Declare a variable called `myName`.
- Initialize `myName` with a suitable value, on a separate line (you can use your actual name, or something else).
- Declare a variable called `myAge` and initialize it with a value, on the same line.

## Variables 2

In this task you need to add a new line to correct the value stored in the existing `myName` variable to your own name.

## Variables 3

The final task for now — in this case you are provided with some existing code, which has two errors present in it. The results panel should be outputting the name `Chris`, and a statement about how old Chris will be in 20 years' time. How can you fix the problem and correct the output?
