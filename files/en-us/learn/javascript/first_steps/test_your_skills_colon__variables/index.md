This aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our [Storing the information you need — Variables](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables) article.

> **Note:** You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to work on the tasks.
>
> If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.

> **Note:** In the examples below, if there is an error in your code it will be outputted into the results panel on the page, to help you try to figure out the answer (or into the browser's JavaScript console, in the case of the downloadable version).

## Variables 1

In this task we want you to:

- Declare a variable called `myName`.
- Initialize `myName` with a suitable value, on a separate line (you can use your actual name, or something else).
- Declare a variable called `myAge` and initialize it with a value, on the same line.

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

## Variables 2

In this task you need to add a new line to correct the value stored in the existing `myName` variable to your own name.

## Variables 3

The final task for now — in this case you are provided with some existing code, which has two errors present in it. The results panel should be outputting the name `Chris`, and a statement about how old Chris will be in 20 years' time. How can you fix the problem and correct the output?

## Assessment or further help

You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.

If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:

1.  Put your work into an online shareable editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.
2.  Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the [MDN Discourse forum Learning category](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn). Your post should include:

    - A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Variables 1 skill test".
    - Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.
    - A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
    - A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
