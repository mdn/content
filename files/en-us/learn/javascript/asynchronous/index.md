In this module, we take a look at {{Glossary("asynchronous")}} {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, why it is important, and how it can be used to effectively handle potential blocking operations, such as fetching resources from a server.

## Prerequisites

Asynchronous JavaScript is a fairly advanced topic, and you are advised to work through [JavaScript first steps](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps) and [JavaScript building blocks](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks) modules before attempting this.

> **Note:** If you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you can try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/) or [Glitch](https://glitch.com).

## Guides

- [Introducing asynchronous JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Introducing)
  - : In this article, we'll learn about **synchronous** and **asynchronous** programming, why we often need to use asynchronous techniques, and the problems related to the way asynchronous functions have historically been implemented in JavaScript.
- [How to use promises](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Promises)
  - : Here we'll introduce promises and show how to use promise-based APIs. We'll also introduce the `async` and `await` keywords.
- [Implementing a promise-based API](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Implementing_a_promise-based_API)
  - : This article will outline how to implement your own promise-based API.
- [Introducing workers](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Introducing_workers)
  - : Workers enable you to run certain tasks in a separate thread to keep your main code responsive. In this article, we'll rewrite a long-running synchronous function to use a worker.

## Assessments

- [Sequencing animations](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Sequencing_animations)
  - : The assessment asks you to use promises to play a set of animations in a particular sequence.
