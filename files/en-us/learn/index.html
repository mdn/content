<p class="summary">Welcome to the MDN learning area. This set of articles aims to provide complete beginners to web development with all that they need to start coding websites.</p>

<p>The aim of this area of MDN is not to take you from "beginner" to "expert" but to take you from "beginner" to "comfortable." From there, you should be able to start making your way, learning from <a href="/en-US/">the rest of MDN</a>, and other intermediate to advanced resources that assume a lot of previous knowledge.</p>

<p>If you are a complete beginner, web development can be challenging — we will hold your hand and provide enough detail for you to feel comfortable and learn the topics properly. You should feel at home whether you are a student learning web development (on your own or as part of a class), a teacher looking for class materials, a hobbyist, or someone who just wants to understand more about how web technologies work.</p>

<h2 id="Whats_new">What's new?</h2>

<p>The content in the learning area is being added to regularly. We have started keeping <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Release_notes">Learning area release notes</a> to show what has changed — keep checking back frequently!</p>

<p>If you have questions regarding topics you'd like to see covered or feel are missing, drop us a message on our <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn">Discourse forum</a>.</p>

  <h4 id="Looking_to_become_a_front-end_web_developer">Looking to become a front-end web
    developer?</h4>

  <p>We have put together a course that includes all the essential information you need to
    work towards your goal.</p>

<h2 id="Where_to_start">Where to start</h2>

<dl>
 <dt>Complete beginner</dt>
 <dd>If you are a complete beginner to web development, we'd recommend that you start by working through our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web">Getting started with the web</a> module, which provides a practical introduction to web development.</dd>
 <dt>Beyond the basics</dt>
 <dd>If you have a bit of knowledge already, the next step is to learn {{glossary("HTML")}} and {{glossary("CSS")}} in detail: start with our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML">Introduction to HTML</a> module and move on to our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps">CSS first steps</a> module.</dd>
 <dt>Moving onto scripting</dt>
 <dd>If you are comfortable with HTML and CSS already, or you are mainly interested in coding, you'll want to move on to {{glossary("JavaScript")}} or server-side development. Begin with our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps">JavaScript first steps</a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps">Server-side first steps</a> modules.</dd>
 <dt>Frameworks and tooling</dt>
 <dd>After mastering the essentials of vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you should learn about <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools">client-side web development tools</a>, and then consider digging into <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks">client-side JavaScript frameworks</a>, and <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side">server-side website programming</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Our <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary">glossary</a> provides terminology definitions. Besides, if you have a specific question about web development, our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions">Common questions</a> section may have something to help you.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Getting_our_code_examples">Getting our code examples</h2>

<p>The code examples you'll encounter in the Learning Area are all <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/">available on GitHub</a>. If you want to copy them all to your computer, the easiest way is to <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/archive/master.zip">download a ZIP of the latest master code branch</a>.</p>

<p>If you prefer to copy the repo in a more flexible way that allows for automatic updates, you can follow the more complex instructions:</p>

<ol>
 <li><a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Install Git</a> on your machine. This is the underlying version control system software that GitHub works on top of.</li>
 <li>Open your computer's <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089">command prompt</a> (Windows) or terminal (<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal">Linux</a>, <a href="https://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line">macOS</a>).</li>
 <li>To copy the learning area repo to a folder called learning-area in the current location your command prompt/terminal is pointing to, use the following command:
  <pre class="brush: bash">git clone https://github.com/mdn/learning-area</pre>
 </li>
 <li>You can now enter the directory and find the files you are after (either using your Finder/File Explorer or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cd_(command)"><code>cd</code> command</a>).</li>
</ol>

<p>You can update the <code>learning-area</code> repository with any changes made to the master version on GitHub with the following steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li>In your command prompt/terminal, go inside the <code>learning-area</code> directory using <code>cd</code>. For example, if you were in the parent directory:

  <pre class="brush: bash">cd learning-area</pre>
 </li>
 <li>Update the repository using the following command:
  <pre class="brush: bash">git pull</pre>
 </li>
</ol>
