<p>Our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks">Understanding client-side JavaScript frameworks</a> module is now available. Learn why frameworks exist, when you should use one (and when you shouldn't), what kinds of features are common to all frameworks, and how they relate to the vanilla JavaScript you may already know. Once you have a general understanding of frameworks, move on to tutorial series covering popular frameworks like React, Ember, and Vue.</p>

<p>Our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms">Web Forms</a> learning module now has "Test your skills" assessments accompanying the articles.</p>
