<p>This aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Other_form_controls">Other form controls</a> article.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to work on the tasks.<br>
 <br>
 If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>In our first "other controls" assessment, we'll get you to create a multi-line text input.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Create a basic multi-line text input.</li>
 <li>Associate it semantically with the provided "Comment" label.</li>
 <li>Give the input 35 columns, and 10 rows of space in which to add comments.</li>
 <li>Give the comments a maximum length of 100 characters.</li>
</ol>

<p>Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:</p>

<h2 id="Other_controls_2">Other controls 2</h2>

<p>Now it's time to have a go at implementing a drop-down select menu, to allow a user to pick their favourite food from the choices provided.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Create your basic select box structure.</li>
 <li>Associate it semantically with the provided "Comment" label.</li>
 <li>Inside the list, split the choices up into 2 subgroups — "mains" and "snacks".</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Other_controls_3">Other controls 3</h2>

<p>In our final task of this set, we start with much the same list of food choices. However, this time we want to do things differently:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Create a basic text input that is semantically associated with the provided label.</li>
 <li>Put the food choices into a list that can be associated with a form input.</li>
 <li>Associate the list with your text input, so that when you type characters, any of the list options that match the character sequence are given in a dropdown list as autocomplete suggestions.</li>
</ol>

<p>You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.</p>

<p>If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Put your work into an online shareable editor such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.</li>
 <li>Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the <a class="external external-icon" href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn" rel="noopener">MDN Discourse forum Learning category</a>. Your post should include:
  <ul>
   <li>A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Other controls 1 skill test".</li>
   <li>Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.</li>
   <li>A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.</li>
   <li>A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
