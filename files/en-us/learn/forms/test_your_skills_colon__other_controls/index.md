This aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our [Other form controls](/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Other_form_controls) article.

> **Note:** You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to work on the tasks.

> If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.

## Other controls 1

In our first "other controls" assessment, we'll get you to create a multi-line text input.

1.  Create a basic multi-line text input.
2.  Associate it semantically with the provided "Comment" label.
3.  Give the input 35 columns, and 10 rows of space in which to add comments.
4.  Give the comments a maximum length of 100 characters.

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

## Other controls 2

Now it's time to have a go at implementing a drop-down select menu, to allow a user to pick their favourite food from the choices provided.

1.  Create your basic select box structure.
2.  Associate it semantically with the provided "food" label.
3.  Inside the list, split the choices up into 2 subgroups — "mains" and "snacks".

## Other controls 3

In our final task of this set, we start with much the same list of food choices. However, this time we want to do things differently:

1.  Create a basic text input that is semantically associated with the provided label.
2.  Put the food choices into a list that can be associated with a form input.
3.  Associate the list with your text input, so that when you type characters, any of the list options that match the character sequence are given in a dropdown list as autocomplete suggestions.

## Assessment or further help

You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.

If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:

1.  Put your work into an online shareable editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.
2.  Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the [MDN Discourse forum Learning category](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn). Your post should include:

    - A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Other controls 1 skill test".
    - Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.
    - A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
    - A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
