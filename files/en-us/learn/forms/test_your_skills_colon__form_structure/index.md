This aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our [How to structure a web form](/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/How_to_structure_a_web_form) article.

> **Note:** You can try out the solution in the interactive editor below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to work on the tasks.
>
> If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.

## Form structure 1

In this task we want you to structure the provided form features:

1.  Separate out the first two and second two form fields into two distinct containers, each with a descriptive legend (use "Personal details" for the first two, and "Comment information" for the second two).
2.  Mark up each text label with an appropriate element so that it is semantically associated with its respective form field.
3.  Add a suitable set of structural elements around the label/field pairs to separate them out.

> [Download the starting point for this task](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/forms/tasks/form-structure/form-structure1-download.html) to work in your own editor or in an online editor.

## Assessment or further help

You can practice this example in the Interactive Editor above.

If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:

1.  Put your work into an online shareable editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.
2.  Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the [MDN Discourse forum Learning category](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn). Your post should include:

    - A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Form structure 1 skill test".
    - Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.
    - A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
    - A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
