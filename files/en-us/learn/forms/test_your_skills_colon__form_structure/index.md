<p>This aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/How_to_structure_a_web_form">How to structure a web form</a> article.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can try out the solution in the interactive editor below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to work on the tasks.<br>
 <br>
 If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Form_structure_1">Form structure 1</h2>

<p>In this task we want you to structure the provided form features:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Separate out the first two and second two form fields into two distinct containers, each with a descriptive legend (use "Personal details" for the first two, and "Comment information" for the second two).</li>
 <li>Mark up each text label with an appropriate element so that it is semantically associated with its respective form field.</li>
 <li>Add a suitable set of structural elements around the label/field pairs to separate them out.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/forms/tasks/form-structure/form-structure1-download.html">Download the starting point for this task</a> to work in your own editor or in an online editor.</p>

<h2 id="Assessment_or_further_help">Assessment or further help</h2>

<p>You can practice this example in the Interactive Editor above.</p>

<p>If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Put your work into an online shareable editor such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.</li>
 <li>Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the <a class="external external-icon" href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn" rel="noopener">MDN Discourse forum Learning category</a>. Your post should include:
  <ul>
   <li>A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Form structure 1 skill test".</li>
   <li>Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.</li>
   <li>A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.</li>
   <li>A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
