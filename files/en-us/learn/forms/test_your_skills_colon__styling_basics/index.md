This aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our [Styling web forms](/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Styling_web_forms) article.

> **Note:** You can try out solutions by editing the starting point file locally, however it may be helpful to put your code in an online tool such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to work on the tasks.

> If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.

## Styling basics 1

Our basic form styling assessment is fairly free-form, and you have a lot of flexibility over what you end up doing here. But your CSS should aim to fulfill the following requirements:

1.  Add some kind of lightweight "reset" to make fonts, padding, margin, and sizing more consistent to begin with.
2.  On top of that, add in some nice, consistent styling for the inputs and button.
3.  Use some kind of layout technique to make the inputs and labels line up neatly.

> [Download the starting point for this task](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/forms/tasks/styling-basics/styling-basics1-download.html) to work in your own editor or in an online editor.

## Assessment or further help

You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.

If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:

1.  Put your work into an online shareable editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.
2.  Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the [MDN Discourse forum Learning category](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn). Your post should include:

    - A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Styling basics 1 skill test".
    - Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.
    - A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
    - A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
