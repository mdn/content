<p>This aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Styling_web_forms">Styling web forms</a> article.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can try out solutions by editing the starting point file locally, however it may be helpful to put your code in an online tool such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to work on the tasks.<br>
 <br>
 If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h2 id="Styling_basics_1">Styling basics 1</h2>

<p>Our basic form styling assessment is fairly free-form, and you have a lot of flexibility over what you end up doing here. But your CSS should aim to fulfill the following requirements:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Add some kind of lightweight "reset" to make fonts, padding, margin, and sizing more consistent to begin with.</li>
 <li>On top of that, add in some nice, consistent styling for the inputs and button.</li>
 <li>Use some kind of layout technique to make the inputs and labels line up neatly.</li>
</ol>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/forms/tasks/styling-basics/styling-basics1-download.html">Download the starting point for this task</a> to work in your own editor or in an online editor.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Assessment_or_further_help">Assessment or further help</h2>

<p>You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.</p>

<p>If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Put your work into an online shareable editor such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.</li>
 <li>Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the <a class="external external-icon" href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn" rel="noopener">MDN Discourse forum Learning category</a>. Your post should include:
  <ul>
   <li>A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Styling basics 1 skill test".</li>
   <li>Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.</li>
   <li>A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.</li>
   <li>A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
