<p>This aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/HTML5_input_types">The HTML5 input types</a> article.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to work on the tasks.<br>
 <br>
 If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.</p>
</div>

<p>First let's explore some of the new HTML5 input types. Create appropriate inputs for a user to update their details for:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Email</li>
 <li>Website</li>
 <li>Phone number</li>
 <li>Favourite color</li>
</ol>

<p>Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:</p>

<p>{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/html/forms/tasks/html5-controls/html5-controls1.html", '100%', 700)}}</p>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/html/forms/tasks/html5-controls/html5-controls1-download.html">Download the starting point for this task</a> to work in your own editor or in an online editor.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="HTML5_controls_2">HTML5 controls 2</h2>

<p>Next, we want you to implement a slider control to allow the user to choose a maximum number of people to invite to their party.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Implement a basic slider control to go along with the provided label.</li>
 <li>Give it a minimum value of 1, maximum value of 30, and initial value of 10.</li>
 <li>Create a corresponding output element to put the current value of the slider into. Give it a class of <code>invite-output</code>, and semantically associate it with the input. If you do this correctly, the JavaScript included on the page will automatically update the output value when the slider is moved.</li>
</ol>

<p>Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:</p>

<h2 id="Assessment_or_further_help">Assessment or further help</h2>

<p>You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.</p>

<p>If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Put your work into an online shareable editor such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.</li>
 <li>Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the <a class="external external-icon" href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn" rel="noopener">MDN Discourse forum Learning category</a>. Your post should include:
  <ul>
   <li>A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for HTML5 controls 1 skill test".</li>
   <li>Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.</li>
   <li>A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.</li>
   <li>A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
