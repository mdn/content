The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our [The HTML5 input types](/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/HTML5_input_types) article.

## HTML controls 1

First, let's explore some input types. Create appropriate inputs for a user to update their details for:

1. Email
2. Website
3. Phone number
4. Favorite color

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/html/forms/tasks/html5-controls/html5-controls1.html", '100%', 700)}}

## HTML controls 2

Next, we want you to implement a slider control to allow the user to choose a maximum number of people to invite to their party.

1. Implement a basic slider control to go along with the provided label.
2. Give it a minimum value of 1, maximum value of 30, initial value of 10 and element `id` of `max-invite`.
3. Create a corresponding output element to put the current value of the slider into. Give it a class of `invite-output`, and semantically associate it with the input. If you do this correctly, the JavaScript included on the page will automatically update the output value when the slider is moved.
