This aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our [The HTML5 input types](/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/HTML5_input_types) article.

> **Note:** You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to work on the tasks.

> If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the [Assessment or further help](#assessment_or_further_help) section at the bottom of this page.

## HTML controls 1

First, let's explore some input types. Create appropriate inputs for a user to update their details for:

1. Email
2. Website
3. Phone number
4. Favorite color

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/html/forms/tasks/html5-controls/html5-controls1.html", '100%', 700)}}

## HTML controls 2

Next, we want you to implement a slider control to allow the user to choose a maximum number of people to invite to their party.

1. Implement a basic slider control to go along with the provided label.
2. Give it a minimum value of 1, maximum value of 30, initial value of 10 and element `id` of `max-invite`.
3. Create a corresponding output element to put the current value of the slider into. Give it a class of `invite-output`, and semantically associate it with the input. If you do this correctly, the JavaScript included on the page will automatically update the output value when the slider is moved.

## Assessment or further help

You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.

If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:

1. Put your work into an online shareable editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.
2. Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the [MDN Discourse forum Learning category](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn/250). Your post should include:

    - A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for HTML controls 1 skill test".
    - Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.
    - A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
    - A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
