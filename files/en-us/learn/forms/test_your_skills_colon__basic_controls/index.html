<p>This aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Basic_native_form_controls">Basic native form controls</a> article.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to work on the tasks.<br>
 <br>
 If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Basic_controls_1">Basic controls 1</h2>

<p>This task starts you off nice and gently by asking you to create two <code>&lt;input&gt;</code> elements, for a user's ID and password, along with a submit button.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Create appropriate inputs for user ID and password.</li>
 <li>You should also associate them with their text labels semantically.</li>
 <li>Create a submit button inside the remaining list item, with button text of "Log in".</li>
</ol>

<p>Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:</p>

</div>

<h2 id="Basic_controls_2">Basic controls 2</h2>

<p>The next task requires you to create working sets of checkboxes and radio buttons, from the provided text labels.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Turn the first <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code>'s contents into a set of radio buttons — you should only be able to select one pony character at once.</li>
 <li>Make it so that the first radio button is selected upon page load.</li>
 <li>Turn the second <code>&lt;fieldset&gt;</code>'s content into a set of checkboxes.</li>
 <li>Add a couple more hotdog choices of your own.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Basic_controls_3">Basic controls 3</h2>

<p>The final task in this set requires you to create a file picker.</p>

<ol>
 <li>Create a basic file picker.</li>
 <li>Allow the user to pick multiple files at once.</li>
 <li>Allow the file picker to accept JPG and PNG images only.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="Assessment_or_further_help">Assessment or further help</h2>

<p>You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.</p>

<p>If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Put your work into an online shareable editor such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.</li>
 <li>Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the <a class="external external-icon" href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn" rel="noopener">MDN Discourse forum Learning category</a>. Your post should include:
  <ul>
   <li>A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Basic controls 1 skill test".</li>
   <li>Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.</li>
   <li>A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.</li>
   <li>A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
