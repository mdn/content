The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our [Basic native form controls](/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Basic_native_form_controls) article.

> **Note:** You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to work on the tasks.

> If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the [Assessment or further help](#assessment_or_further_help) section at the bottom of this page.

## Basic controls 1

This task starts you off nice and gently by asking you to create two `<input>` elements, for a user's ID and password, along with a submit button.

1. Create appropriate inputs for user ID and password.
2. You should also associate them with their text labels semantically.
3. Create a submit button inside the remaining list item, with button text of "Log in".

## Basic controls 2

The next task requires you to create working sets of checkboxes and radio buttons, from the provided text labels.

1. Turn the first `<fieldset>`'s contents into a set of radio buttons — you should only be able to select one pony character at once.
2. Make it so that the first radio button is selected upon page load.
3. Turn the second `<fieldset>`'s content into a set of checkboxes.
4. Add a couple more hotdog choices of your own.

## Basic controls 3

The final task in this set requires you to create a file picker.

1. Create a basic file picker.
2. Allow the user to pick multiple files at once.
3. Allow the file picker to accept JPG and PNG images only.

## Assessment or further help

You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.

If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:

1. Put your work into an online shareable editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.
2. Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the [MDN Discourse forum Learning category](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn/250). Your post should include:

   - A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for Basic controls 1 skill test".
   - Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.
   - A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
   - A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
