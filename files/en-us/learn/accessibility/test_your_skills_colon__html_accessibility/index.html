<p>This aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML">HTML: A good basis for accessibility</a> article.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to work on the tasks.<br>
 <br>
 If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.</p>

<h2 id="HTML_accessibility_1">HTML accessibility 1</h2>

<p>In this task we will test your understanding of text semantics, and why they are good for accessibility. The given text is a simple information panel with action buttons, but the HTML is really bad.</p>

<p>We want you to update it use appropriate semantic HTML. You don't need to worry too much about recreating the <em>exact</em> same look and text sizing, as long as the semantics are good.</p>

<p>Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:</p>

<p>{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/accessibility/tasks/html-css/html/html-a11y1.html", '100%', 700)}}</p>

<div class="callout">
<p><a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/accessibility/tasks/html-css/html/html-a11y1-download.html">Download the starting point for this task</a> to work in your own editor or in an online editor.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="HTML_accessibility_2">HTML accessibility 2</h2>

<p>In the second task, you have a form containing three input fields. You need to:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Semantically associate the input with their labels.</li>
 <li>Assume that these inputs will be part of a larger form, and wrap them in an element that associates them all together as a single related group.</li>
 <li>Give the group a description/title that summarizes all of the information as personal data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:</p>

<p>{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/accessibility/tasks/html-css/html/html-a11y2.html", '100%', 700)}}</p>

<div class="callout">

</div>

<h2 id="HTML_accessibility_3">HTML accessibility 3</h2>

<p>In this task you are required to turn all the information links in the paragraph into good, accessible links.</p>

<ul>
 <li>The first two links just go to regular web pages.</li>
 <li>The third link goes to a PDF, and it's large — 8MB.</li>
 <li>The fourth link goes to a Word document, so the user will need some kind of application installed that can handle that.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:</p>

<p>{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/accessibility/tasks/html-css/html/html-a11y3.html", '100%', 700)}}</p>

<div class="callout">
<p><a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/accessibility/tasks/html-css/html/html-a11y3-download.html">Download the starting point for this task</a> to work in your own editor or in an online editor.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="HTML_accessibility_4">HTML accessibility 4</h2>

<p>In our final HTML accessibility task, you are given a simple image gallery, which has some accessibility problems. Can you fix them?</p>

<ul>
 <li>The header image has an accessibility issue, and so do the gallery images.</li>
 <li>You could take the header image further and implement it using CSS for arguably better accessibility. Why is this better, and what would a solution look like?</li>
</ul>

<p>Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:</p>

<p>{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/accessibility/tasks/html-css/html/html-a11y4.html", '100%', 700)}}</p>

<div class="callout">
<p><a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/accessibility/tasks/html-css/html/html-a11y4-download.html">Download the starting point for this task</a> to work in your own editor or in an online editor.</p>

<h2 id="Assessment_or_further_help">Assessment or further help</h2>

<p>You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.</p>

<p>If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Put your work into an online shareable editor such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.</li>
 <li>Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the <a class="external external-icon" href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn" rel="noopener">MDN Discourse forum Learning category</a>. Your post should include:
  <ul>
   <li>A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for HTML accessibility 1 skill test".</li>
   <li>Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.</li>
   <li>A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.</li>
   <li>A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
