The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our [HTML: A good basis for accessibility](/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML) article.

> **Note:** You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) to work on the tasks.

> If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the [Assessment or further help](#assessment_or_further_help) section at the bottom of this page.

## HTML accessibility 1

In this task we will test your understanding of text semantics, and why they are good for accessibility. The given text is a simple information panel with action buttons, but the HTML is really bad.

We want you to update it use appropriate semantic HTML. You don't need to worry too much about recreating the _exact_ same look and text sizing, as long as the semantics are good.

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/accessibility/tasks/html-css/html/html-a11y1.html", '100%', 1100)}}

## HTML accessibility 2

In the second task, you have a form containing three input fields. You need to:

- Semantically associate the input with their labels.
- Assume that these inputs will be part of a larger form, and wrap them in an element that associates them all together as a single related group.
- Give the group a description/title that summarizes all of the information as personal data.

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/accessibility/tasks/html-css/html/html-a11y2.html", '100%', 700)}}

## HTML accessibility 3

In this task you are required to turn all the information links in the paragraph into good, accessible links.

- The first two links just go to regular web pages.
- The third link goes to a PDF, and it's large — 8MB.
- The fourth link goes to a Word document, so the user will need some kind of application installed that can handle that.

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/accessibility/tasks/html-css/html/html-a11y3.html", '100%', 700)}}

## HTML accessibility 4

In our final HTML accessibility task, you are given a simple image gallery, which has some accessibility problems. Can you fix them?

- The header image has an accessibility issue, and so do the gallery images.
- You could take the header image further and implement it using CSS for arguably better accessibility. Why is this better, and what would a solution look like?

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/accessibility/tasks/html-css/html/html-a11y4.html", '100%', 1100)}}

## Assessment or further help

You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.

If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:

1. Put your work into an online shareable editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [jsFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/). You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.
2. Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the [MDN Discourse forum Learning category](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn/250). Your post should include:

   - A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for HTML accessibility 1 skill test".
   - Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.
   - A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.
   - A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.
