<p>This aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript">CSS and JavaScript accessibility best practices</a> article.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can try out solutions in the interactive editors below, however it may be helpful to download the code and use an online tool such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to work on the tasks.<br>
 <br>
 If you get stuck, then ask us for help — see the {{anch("Assessment or further help")}} section at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p>In the first task you are presented with a list of links. However, their accessibility is pretty bad — there is no way to really tell that they are links, or to tell which one the user is focussed on.</p>

<p>We'd like you to assume that the existing ruleset with the <code>a</code> selector is supplied by some CMS, and that you can't change it — instead, you need to create new rules to make the links look and behave like links, and for the user to be able to tell where they are in the list.</p>

<p>Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:</p>

<p>In this next task you are presented with a simple bit of content — just headings and paragraphs. There are  accessibility issues with the colors and sizing of the text; we'd like you to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Explain what the problems are, and what the guidelines are that state the acceptable values for color and sizing.</li>
  <li>Select new values for the color and font-size that fix the problem.</li>
  <li>Update the CSS with these new values to fix the problem.</li>
  <li>Test the code to make sure the problem is now fixed. Explain what tools or methods you used to select the new values and test the code.</li>
</ol>

<p>Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:</p>

<h2 id="JavaScript_accessibility_1">JavaScript accessibility 1</h2>

<p>In our final task here, you have some JavaScripting to do. We have a simple app that presents a list of animal names. Clicking one of the animal names causes a further description of that animal to appear in a box below the list.</p>

<p>But it is not very accessible — in its current state you can only operate it with the mouse. We'd like you to add to the HTML and JavaScript to make it keyboard accessible too.</p>

<h2 id="Assessment_or_further_help">Assessment or further help</h2>

<p>You can practice these examples in the Interactive Editors above.</p>

<p>If you would like your work assessed, or are stuck and want to ask for help:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Put your work into an online shareable editor such as <a href="https://codepen.io/">CodePen</a>, <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/">jsFiddle</a>, or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a>. You can write the code yourself, or use the starting point files linked to in the above sections.</li>
 <li>Write a post asking for assessment and/or help at the <a class="external external-icon" href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn/learn" rel="noopener">MDN Discourse forum Learning category</a>. Your post should include:
  <ul>
   <li>A descriptive title such as "Assessment wanted for CSS accessibility 1 skill test".</li>
   <li>Details of what you have already tried, and what you would like us to do, e.g. if you are stuck and need help, or want an assessment.</li>
   <li>A link to the example you want assessed or need help with, in an online shareable editor (as mentioned in step 1 above). This is a good practice to get into — it's very hard to help someone with a coding problem if you can't see their code.</li>
   <li>A link to the actual task or assessment page, so we can find the question you want help with.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>
