This article details the four types of KumaScript error, and some steps you can take to fix them.

## DocumentParsingError

`DocumentParsingError` errors appear when KumaScript has trouble understanding something in the document itself. The most common cause is a syntax error in a [macro](/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Macros).

Check for:

- Use of curly braces without intending to call a macro.
  - : If you need to write  \\{ in a document without calling a macro you can escape it with a \ like this: `\\{`
- Use of a special character in a macro parameter.
  - : If you need to use a " or a \  inside of a macro parameter they can be escaped with a \ like this: `\\` or `\"`
- Missing commas between macro parameters.
  - : Macro parameters need to be delimited by a comma (,) but not at the end of the list of parameters; for example `\{\{anch("top", "Back to top")}}`.
- HTML tags appearing inside a macro call
  - : If you apply styling to a macro, it will often break because, for example, a `</code>` tag may have appeared inside the macro code in the source code. Check the source view to see what's there, and remove any unnecessary styling.

## TemplateLoadingError

`TemplateLoadingError` errors appear when KumaScript has trouble finding which [macro](/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Macros) to include on a page.

Check for:

- Misspelling of macro names or renamed macros.
  - : You can look at the list of active macros in the [Yari repo](https://github.com/mdn/yari/tree/master/kumascript/macros).

## TemplateExecutionError

`TemplateExecutionError` errors appear when KumaScript encounters an error in the macro. If the error persists, [report an issue](https://github.com/mdn/yari/issues), including the URL of the page and the text of the error.

## Error & Unknown

This is the category errors end up in if they are not one of the other kinds of error.
