<p>Deleting pages completely from MDN is a relatively rare occurrence. The most common reasons are pages that were created for spam or by mistake. Pages that have had a useful life, but describe technology that has become obsolete are archived by being moved to the /Archive section of MDN, rather than being deleted.</p>

<h2 id="Requesting_page_deletion">Requesting page deletion</h2>

<p><span class="seoSummary">Only MDN <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Roles/Admins">administrators</a> are able to delete pages. As a non-admin user, you can request that a page be deleted.</span></p>

<p>To arrange for a page to be deleted, do the following:</p>

<ol>
 <li><strong>Do not erase or change the page content.</strong> We want to have the record of the page as it was at deletion time.</li>
 <li>Add the tag "Junk" to the page. Do not remove other tags.</li>
 <li>If the page is particularly urgently in need of deletion (for example, its content is inappropriate, offensive, or technically dangerous), <a href="mailto:mdn-admins@mozilla.org" title="Notify an administrator">notify an MDN administrator</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p>An administrator will delete the page when possible, after confirming that deletion is appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="How_to_delete_a_page">How to delete a page</h2>

<p>Administrators who have decided to delete a page, do the following:</p>

<ol>
 <li>OpenÂ  the <strong>Advanced</strong> menu, near the top-right corner of the page you want to delete.</li>
 <li>Click <strong>Delete this page</strong>. The "Delete document" screen appears, which looks like this:<br>
  <br>
  This shows the title of the page you have selected to delete, along with some metadata about it.</li>
 <li>Enter an appropriate reason in the <strong>Reason</strong> field, such as "Spam" or "Junk" or "Created by mistake".</li>
 <li>Click the <strong>Delete</strong> button. The "Document Deleted" screen appears, which will also be shown if anyone follows a link to this page. (Unprivileged users do not see the <strong>Restore this document</strong> button.)</li>
</ol>
