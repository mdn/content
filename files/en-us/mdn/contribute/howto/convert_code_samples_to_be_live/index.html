<div>{{MDNSidebar}}</div><p class="summary">MDN has a "<a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Editor/Live_samples">live sample</a>" system, where the code sample shown on a page is directly used to display the output of that same sample. However, many existing articles have code samples that do not yet use this system, and need to be converted.</p>

<p><span class="seoSummary">Live samples, which let you see what a sample's output looks like, make documentation more dynamic and instructive. This guide covers how to take existing samples and add "live" functionality to them.</span></p>
