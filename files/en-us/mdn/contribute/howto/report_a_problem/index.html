<p>Now and then, you may run into problems while using MDN. Whether it's a problem with site infrastructure or an error in documentation content, you can either try to fix it yourself or report the problem. While the former is preferred, the latter is sometimes the best you can manage, and that's okay too.</p>

<h2 id="Documentation_errors_or_requests">Documentation errors or requests</h2>

<p>Obviously, since MDN is a wiki, the best thing you can possibly do is fix problems you spot yourself. But maybe you don't know the answer or are in the middle of a deadline on your own project or something, and need to jot down the problem so someone can look at it later.</p>

<p>The way to report a documentation problem by filing an <a href="https://github.com/mdn/sprints/issues/new?template=issue-template.md&amp;projects=mdn/sprints/2&amp;labels=user-report">documentation issue</a>. The issue template contains sections for the information needed to get us started on fixing the issue. Feel free to delete any part of the template that isn't helpful or relevant to your issue.</p>

<p>Of course, our writing community is busy, so sometimes the quickest way to see a documentation problem resolved is to fix it yourself. See <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Create_and_edit_pages" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Creating_and_editing_pages">How to create and edit pages</a> for details.</p>

<p><a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Kuma" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma">Kuma</a>, the Mozilla-developed platform used for the MDN web site, is in a state of continuous development. Our developers—as well as a number of volunteer contributors—are constantly making improvements. If you see a bug, or have a problem with the site, or even have a suggestion for something that could make the software more awesome, you can use the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/kuma/issues/new" title="File new issue on GitHub">Kuma bug form</a> to file a report. You can also use this form to report performance problems with the site, though odds are that performance-monitoring tools have already notified the appropriate people.</p>
