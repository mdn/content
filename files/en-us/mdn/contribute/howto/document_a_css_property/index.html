<p>As the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a> standards evolve, new properties are always being added. The MDN <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">CSS Reference</a> needs to be kept up-to-date with these developments. This document gives step-by-step instructions for creating a CSS property reference page.</p>

<p>Each CSS property reference page follows the same structure. This helps readers find information more easily, especially once they are familiar with the standard reference page format.</p>

<h2 id="Step_1_—_Decide_which_property_to_document">Step 1 — Decide which property to document</h2>

<p>First, you will need to decide which property to document. You might have noticed that a page is missing, or you might have seen missing content reported in our <a href="https://github.com/mdn/content/issues">issues list</a>. For details about the CSS property you will need to find a relevant specification for it (e.g., a <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">W3C specification</a>, or a bug report for a non-standard property used in rendering engines like Gecko or Blink).</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Pro tips:</strong></p>

<ul>
 <li>When using a W3C spec, always use the <strong>Editor's Draft</strong> (note the red banner on the left side) and not a published version (e.g. Working Draft). The Editor's Draft is always closer to the final version!</li>
 <li>If the implementation and spec diverge, feel free to mention it in the implementation bug: it may be a bug in the implementation (and a follow-up bug will be filed), a delay in the publication of a new spec, or an error in the spec (in which case a spec bug is worth filing).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h2 id="Step_2_—_Check_the_database_of_CSS_properties">Step 2 — Check the database of CSS properties</h2>

<p>Several characteristics of a CSS property, such as its syntax or if it can be animated, are mentioned in several pages and are therefore stored in an ad-hoc database. Macros that you'll use on the page need information about the property that is stored there, so start by <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Update_the_CSS_JSON_DB">checking that this information is there</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Step_3_—_Creating_the_CSS_property_page">Step 3 — Creating the CSS property page</h2>

<p>Preparations finished! Now we can add the actual CSS property page. The easiest way to create a new CSS property page is to copy the content of an existing page and to edit it to suit the new property. You can find out how to add a new page in our <a href="https://github.com/mdn/content#adding-a-new-document">GitHub README</a>.</p>

<p>When creating a reference page, you'll want to add <em>Examples</em>. To do that follow this <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Live_samples">tutorial about live samples</a>. Don't forget that we are in a document explaining one single property: you need to add examples that show how this property is working in isolation, not how the whole specification is used. That means that examples for <code>list-style-type</code> should show what the different property values generate, not how to combine it with other properties, pseudo-classes, or pseudo-elements to generate nice effects. Tutorials and guides can be written to show more.</p>

<p>Once your page is created, submit it as a PR, and a member of our review team will be assigned automatically to review your page.</p>
