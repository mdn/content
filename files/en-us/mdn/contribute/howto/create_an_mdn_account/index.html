<p><span class="seoSummary">To edit MDN content, you need an MDN profile. You don't need a profile to read or search the MDN docs. This guide will help you create your MDN profile.</span></p>

<div class="pull-aside">
<div class="moreinfo"><strong>Why does MDN need my email address?</strong><br>
<br>
Your email address is used for account recovery. MDN administrators may need use your email address to contact you about your account or your activity on the site.<br>
<br>
In addition, you can sign up for notifications (such as <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Watch_a_page">when specific pages change</a>) and messages. For example, if you join our beta testing team, you might receive email about new features that need testing.<br>
<br>
Your email address is never displayed on MDN. It is always used according to MDN's <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/websites/">privacy policy</a>.<br>

<div class="note">If you log in to MDN via GitHub, and you use a "noreply" email address on GitHub, you will <em>not</em> receive messages (including notifications when you subscribe to pages) from MDN.</div>

 <li>At the top of every page on MDN you'll find a button labeled <strong>Sign in</strong>. Click or tap the button to display a list of the authentication services for signing in to MDN.<img alt="Where to find the sign in button" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/17262/sign-in-direction-MDNWebDocs.jpg" style="height: 274px; width: 500px;"></li>

 <li>Click <strong>Create my MDN profile</strong>.</li>
 <li>If the email address you specified in step 4 isn't the same one you use with the authentication service, please check your email and click the link in the confirmation email we send you.</li>
