<div>{{MDNSidebar}}</div><p><span class="seoSummary">The MDN community sometimes is tasked with large documentation projects—that is, large amounts of documentation to be written or edited about a specific topic, or a large maintenance project to existing content.</span> Such projects are framed as "epics" in <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Processes/Agile">MDN's agile process</a>. Efforts that support an <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Engagement/MDN_Durable_Team#Objectives_and_Key_Results">Objective and quarterly Key Result</a> have a project summary document (linked from the wiki page).</p>

<p>Major content areas on MDN are also tracked on a <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Doc_status">doc status page</a> for the project. To learn more about ongoing documentation projects, see the <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Doc_status/Overview">doc status overview</a>.</p>
