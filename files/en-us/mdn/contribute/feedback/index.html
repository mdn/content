<p>Welcome to MDN Web Docs! <span class="seoSummary">If you have suggestions for, or are having problems using the MDN Web Docs, this is the right place to be. The very fact that you're interested in offering feedback makes you even more a part of the Mozilla community, and we thank you in advance for your interest.</span></p>

<p><span class="seoSummary">You have several options for offering your insight; this article will help you do so.</span></p>

<h2 id="Update_the_documentation">Update the documentation</h2>

<p>First of all, if you've seen a problem with the documentation, you should always feel free to correct it yourself. Start by reading about the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/content/#making-contributions">specific steps for getting set up to make contributions</a>.</p>

<p>The sources for the documentation here are <a href="https://github.com/mdn/content/">stored in GitHub</a>, and curated by a team of volunteers and paid staff, so don't be shy — your grammar doesn't have to be perfect. We'll review your changes and help you fix any mistakes; no harm done!</p>

<p>For more information about contributing to MDN documentation, see:</p>
