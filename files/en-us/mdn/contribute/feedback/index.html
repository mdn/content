<p>Welcome to MDN Web Docs! <span class="seoSummary">If you have suggestions for, or are having problems using the MDN Web Docs, this is the right place to be. The very fact that you're interested in offering feedback makes you even more a part of the Mozilla community, and we thank you in advance for your interest.</span></p>

<p><span class="seoSummary">You have several options for offering your insight; this article will help you do so.</span></p>

<h2 id="Update_the_documentation">Update the documentation</h2>

<p>First of all, if you've seen a problem with the documentation, you should always feel free to correct it yourself.</p>

<ol>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Create_an_MDN_account">Sign in</a> using <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
 <li>Click the blue <strong>Edit</strong> button on any page to open the <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Editor">editor</a>.</li>
 <li>Click the <strong>Publish</strong> button when you're finished making changes.</li>
</ol>

<p>The documentation here is in a wiki, and is curated by a team of volunteers and paid staff, so don't be shy — your grammar doesn't have to be perfect. We'll clean it up if you make a mistake; no harm done!</p>
