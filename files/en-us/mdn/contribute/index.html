<p>MDN Web Docs needs your help! We have a large number of typos to fix, examples to write, bugs to fix, people to talk to, and more, and the number is growing as more people start using the site. This page outlines what you can do to help.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>If you haven't contributed to MDN previously, the <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Getting_started">Getting Started</a> guide explains the process in four simple steps. Good news, you're already on step 3: "Finding out how you can help"!</p>
</div>

<h2 id="What_can_I_do_to_help">What can I do to help?</h2>

<p>There are multiple avenues you can take to contribute to MDN depending on your skillset and interests. Along with each task we provide a short description and an approximate time that each type of task typically takes.</p>

<p>If you are not sure what to do, you are always welcome to <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Getting_started#step_4_ask_for_help">ask for help</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Primary_contribution_types">Primary contribution types</h3>

<p>The links in this section lead to detailed guides explaining how to do a particular contribution task that we are most interested in getting community help with, either because they are a critical function, and/or because they have a large backlog associated with them. Please consider helping out with these tasks before you consider contributing in other ways.</p>

<p>We will add more tasks here as time goes on.</p>

<h4 id="priority_ratings">Priority ratings</h4>

<p>You can also look at priority ratings to give you an idea of what the most important work is to work on — we've started giving content bug issues labels of P0, P1, P2, P3, and P4 to signify how important they are, with lower numbers being more important than higher numbers.</p>

<p>These are figured out during the regular MDN bug triage process, based on the <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Documentation_priorities">MDN documentation priority list</a>.</p>


<h3 id="Other_task_types">Other task types</h3>

<p>If our main priorities listed above don't interest you, you can find a number of other, more general task types to get involved with below, split up by skillset.</p>
