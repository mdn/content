MDN Web Docs needs your help! We have a large number of typos to fix, examples to write, bugs to fix, people to talk to, and more, and the number is growing as more people start using the site. This page outlines what you can do to help.

> **Note:** If you haven't contributed to MDN previously, the [Getting Started](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Contributing/Getting_started) guide explains the process in four simple steps. Good news, you're already on step 2: "Picking a task to complete."!

## What can I do to help?

There are multiple avenues you can take to contribute to MDN depending on your skill set and interests. Along with each task we provide a short description and an approximate time that each type of task typically takes.

If you are not sure what to do, you are always welcome to [ask for help](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

### Primary contribution types

The links in this section lead to detailed guides explaining how to do a particular contribution task that we are most interested in getting community help with, either because they are a critical function, and/or because they have a large backlog associated with them. Please consider helping out with these tasks before you consider contributing in other ways.

        Our <a href="https://github.com/mdn/content/issues">content repo</a> is
        where people submit issues to report problems found with MDN docs. We get a lot of content bugs, and any help
        you can give in fixing them would be much appreciated.

We will add more tasks here as time goes on.

### Other task types

If our main priorities listed above don't interest you, you can find a number of other, more general task types to get involved with below, split up by skill set.

If you are more interested in words, you could do the following:

- [Update an existing article with new information](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Howto/Creating_moving_deleting#editing_an_existing_page) (5 minutes-1 hour)
- [Write a new entry in the Glossary](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Howto/Write_a_new_entry_in_the_glossary) (15 minutes-1 hour)

If you are more interested in code, you could try your hand at the following:

- [Convert code samples to be "live"](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Live_samples) (30 minutes)
- [Send a code patch to the Yari codebase](https://github.com/mdn/yari) (1 hour)
- [Write an interactive example](https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) (1 hour)

If you are interested in words _and_ code, you could try your hand at the following:

- [Write or update an API reference](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Howto/Write_an_api_reference) (30 minutes to 2 hours, or more)
- [Write a new article on a topic you are familiar with](https://github.com/mdn/content#adding-a-new-document) (1 hour or more)

> **Note:** If you have found something that is incorrect on MDN but you're not sure how to fix it, you can report problems by [filing a documentation issue](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new/choose). Please give the issue a descriptive title. (It's not helpful to say "Dead link" without saying where you found the link).
