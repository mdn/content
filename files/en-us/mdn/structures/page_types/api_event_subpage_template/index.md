> **Top-of-page macros**
>
> A number of macro calls appear at the top of the content section (immediately below the page frontmatter).
> You should update or delete them according to the advice below:
>
> - `\{{SeeCompatTable}}` — this generates a **This is an experimental technology** banner that indicates the technology is [experimental](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#experimental).
>   If the technology you are documenting is not experimental, you should remove this.
>   If it is experimental, and the technology is hidden behind a pref in Firefox, you should also fill in an entry for it in the [Experimental features in Firefox](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Experimental_features) page.
> - `\{{Deprecated_Header}}` — this generates a **Deprecated** banner that indicates that use of the technology is [discouraged](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#deprecated_and_obsolete).
>   If it isn't, then you can remove the macro call.
> - `\{{SecureContext_Header}}` — this generates a **Secure context** banner that indicates the technology is only available in a [secure context](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts).
>   If it isn't, then you can remove the macro call.
>   If it is, then you should also fill in an entry for it in the [Features restricted to secure contexts](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts/features_restricted_to_secure_contexts) page.
> - `\{{APIRef("GroupDataName")}}` — this generates the left-hand reference sidebar showing quick reference links related to the current page.
>   For example, every page in the [WebVR API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API) has the same sidebar, which points to the other pages in the API.
>   To generate the correct sidebar for your API, you need to add a `GroupData` entry to our GitHub repo, and include the entry's name inside the macro call in place of _GroupDataName_.
>   See our [API reference sidebars](/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Write_an_API_reference/Sidebars) guide for information on how to do this.
> - Remember to remove the `\{{MDNSidebar}}` macro when you copy this page.

> **Parent object link**
>
> Add a link to this new page from its parent object's _Events_ section.
> For example [Element: wheel event](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/wheel_event) is linked from [`Element` > Events](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element#events).
>
> If the parent object does not have an _Events_ section, then add one.
> If this is a new "class" of event, then you should add link to this section of the parent from the [Event reference](/en-US/docs/Web/Events).

{{SeeCompatTable}}{{SecureContext_Header}}{{Deprecated_Header}}{{APIRef("GroupDataName")}}

The summary paragraph — start by naming the event, saying what interface it is part of, and saying what it does.
This should ideally be 1 or 2 short sentences.
You could copy most of this from the property's summary on the corresponding API reference page.

## Syntax

Use the event name in methods like {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}}, or set an event handler property.

```js
addEventListener('NameOfTheEvent', event => { });

onNameOfTheEvent = event => { };
```

## Event type

If the event has a special type, mention it along with its inheritance. If not, indicate that it is a generic event:

_A generic {{domxref("Event")}}._

Or, for example:

_An {{domxref("XRSessionEvent")}}. Inherits from {{domxref("Event")}}._

{{InheritanceDiagram("XRSessionEvent")}}

## Event properties

If the event is not just a generic {{domxref("Event")}}, list the additional properties the event has.

_In addition to the properties listed below, properties from the parent interface, {{domxref("Event")}}, are available._

- {{domxref("XRSessionEvent.session", "session")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : The {{domxref("XRSession")}} to which the event refers.

## Description

If you want to provide additional text (too long for the summary), add a Description section.
It may contain the headings

### Trigger

and

### Use cases

which can provide more information.

## Examples

Fill in a simple example that nicely shows a typical usage of the event, then perhaps some more complex examples (see our guide on how to add [code examples](/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Code_examples) for more information). You should show how to use the event with both, {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}} and with the event handler property.

```js
my code block
```

And/or include a list of links to useful code samples that live elsewhere:

- x
- y
- z

## Specifications

## Browser compatibility

{{Compat}}
