> **Top-of-page macros**

> A number of macro calls appear at the top of the content section (immediately below the page frontmatter).
> You should update or delete them according to the advice below:
> - `\{{SeeCompatTable}}` — this generates a **This is an experimental technology** banner that indicates the technology is [experimental](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#experimental)).
>   If the technology you are documenting is not experimental, you should remove this.
>   If it is experimental, and the technology is hidden behind a pref in Firefox, you should also fill in an entry for it in the [Experimental features in Firefox](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Experimental_features) page.
> - `\{{Deprecated_Header}}` — this generates a **Deprecated** banner that indicates that use of the technology is [discouraged](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#deprecated_and_obsolete).
>   If it isn't, then you can remove the macro call.
> - `\{{SecureContext_Header}}` — this generates a **Secure context** banner that indicates the technology is only available in a [secure context](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts).
>   If it isn't, then you can remove the macro call.
>   If it is, then you should also fill in an entry for it in the [Features restricted to secure contexts](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts/features_restricted_to_secure_contexts) page.
> - `\{{HTMLRef}}` — this generates the left-hand-side reference sidebar for the element.

{{SeeCompatTable}}{{Deprecated_Header}}{{HTMLRef}}

The **`<insert_the_element_name>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element does ... _insert a summary paragraph naming the element and saying what it does (ideally 1 or 2 short sentences)_.

\\{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/tabbed/nameOfElement.html", "tabbed-standard")}}

Further information — at this point, include a few more paragraphs explaining the most important things you need to know about using the element and its main features. It is good to explain briefly what is going on in the interactive example if it is not immediately obvious. You could also explain key points about how this element interacts with important related JavaScript or CSS features. Not too much detail — you don't want to repeat the documentation across pages — but a key point plus a link to that feature's page would be useful. Again, see the `<video>` page for an example.

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

- {{htmlattrdef("attribute1")}}{{Deprecated_inline}}{{experimental_inline}}
  - : Include description here of what the attribute does. Include one term and definition for each attribute. If the attribute is not experimental/deprecated, remove the relevant macro calls.
- {{htmlattrdef("attribute2")}}
  - : etc.

## Events

Include a table of the events fired on this type of element, if any.

| Event name | Fired when                          |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| event 1    | Explain briefly when it is fired... |
| event 2    | Explain briefly when it is fired... |
| etc.       |                                     |

## Examples

Fill in a simple example that nicely shows a typical usage of the element, then perhaps some more complex examples (see our guide on how to add [code examples](/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Code_examples) for more information).

```html
my code block
```

And/or include a list of links to useful code samples that live elsewhere:
