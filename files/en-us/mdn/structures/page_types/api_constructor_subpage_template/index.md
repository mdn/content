> - **tags**

>
>       Include the following tags as appropriate:
>       - Technology status: **Experimental** (if the technology is [experimental](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#experimental)), **Deprecated** (if it is [deprecated](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#deprecated_and_obsolete)), **Non-standard** if it isn't on a standards track.
>       - Special requirements: **Secure context** (if it is available in a secure context only)
>       - Any other tags that represent terms people might search for related to the technology.
>         For example on WebVR interface pages we include **VR** and **Virtual reality**.
> - **browser-compat**
>   - : Replace the placeholder value `path.to.feature.NameOfTheConstructor` with the query string for the constructor in the [Browser compat data repo](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data).
>       The toolchain automatically uses the key to populate the compatibility and specification sections (replacing the `\{{Compat}}` and `\{{Specifications}}` macros).
>
>       Note that you may first need to create/update an entry for the API constructor in our [Browser compat data repo](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data), and the entry for the API will need to include specification information.
>       See our [guide on how to do this](/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Compatibility_tables).

> **Top-of-page macros**
>
> A number of macro calls appear at the top of the content section (immediately below the page frontmatter).
> You should update or delete them according to the advice below:
> - `\{{SeeCompatTable}}` — this generates a **This is an experimental technology** banner that indicates the technology is [experimental](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#experimental)).
>   If the technology you are documenting is not experimental, you should remove this.
>   If it is experimental, and the technology is hidden behind a pref in Firefox, you should also fill in an entry for it in the [Experimental features in Firefox](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Experimental_features) page.
> - `\{{Deprecated_Header}}` — this generates a **Deprecated** banner that indicates that use of the technology is [discouraged](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#deprecated_and_obsolete).
>   If it isn't, then you can remove the macro call.
> - `\{{SecureContext_Header}}` — this generates a **Secure context** banner that indicates the technology is only available in a [secure context](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts).
>   If it isn't, then you can remove the macro call.
>   If it is, then you should also fill in an entry for it in the [Features restricted to secure contexts](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts/features_restricted_to_secure_contexts) page.
> - `\{{APIRef("GroupDataName")}}` — this generates the left hand reference sidebar showing quick reference links related to the current page.
>   For example, every page in the [WebVR API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API) has the same sidebar, which points to the other pages in the API.
>   To generate the correct sidebar for your API, you need to add a `GroupData` entry to our GitHub repo, and include the entry's name inside the macro call in place of _GroupDataName_.
>   See our [API reference sidebars](/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Write_an_API_reference/Sidebars) guide for information on how to do this.
> - Remember to remove the `\{{MDNSidebar}}` macro when you copy this page.

{{SeeCompatTable}}{{SecureContext_Header}}{{Deprecated_Header}}{{APIRef("GroupDataName")}}

The summary paragraph — start by naming the constructor, and saying what it does.
This should ideally be 1 or 2 short sentences.
You could copy most of this from the constructor's summary on the corresponding API reference page.

## Syntax

Fill in a syntax box, according to the guidance in our [syntax sections](/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Syntax_sections) article.

### Parameters

- parameter1 {{optional_inline}}
  - : Include a brief description of the parameter and what it does here. Include one term and definition for each parameter.
    If the parameter is not optional, remove the \\{{optional_inline}} macro call.
- parameter2
  - : etc.

### Return value

Include a description of the constructor's return value, including data type and what it represents.
This is normally just "An instance of the {{domxref("NameOfTheParentInterface")}} object."

### Exceptions

- Exception1
  - : Include a list of all the exceptions that the constructor can raise, along with descriptions of how that exception is raised. Include one term and definition for each exception.
- Exception2
  - : etc.

## Examples

Fill in a simple example that nicely shows a typical usage of the constructor, then perhaps some more complex examples (see our guide on how to add [code examples](/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Code_examples) for more information).

```js
my code block
```

And/or include a list of links to useful code samples that live elsewhere:

- x
- y
- z

## Specifications

{{Specifications}}

## Browser compatibility

{{Compat}}
