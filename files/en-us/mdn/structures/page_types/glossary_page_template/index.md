### Title and slug

A glossary page should have a _title_ and _slug_ of _TermBeingDefined_. Simple

### Tags

In a glossary page, you need to include the following tags (see the _Tags_ section at the bottom of the editor UI): **Glossary**, and **TermBeingDefined**. You can also include further descriptive tags as appropriate.

The TermBeingDefined is ... (include concise definition of the term being defined).

Include further supporting information as required, but not much — no more than 2 more small paragraphs. Any further detailed information, code examples, tutorials, etc. should go in separate articles.
