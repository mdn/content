> - **title**
>   - : Title heading displayed at top of page. Format as _:NameOfTheSelector_.
>       For example, the [`:hover`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover) selector has a title of _:hover_. 
> - **slug**
>   - : The end of the URL path after `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/`). This will be formatted like `Web/CSS/:NameOfTheSelector`.
>       For example, the the [`:hover`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover) selector slug is `Web/CSS/:hover`. 
> - **tags**
>   - : Always include the following tags: **CSS**, **Reference**, _NameOfTheSelector_ (e.g. **:hover**).
>
>       Include the following tags as appropriate:
>       - Type of selector: **Layout**, **Basic Selectors**, **Combinators**, **Pseudo-classes**, **Pseudo-elements**
>       - Technology status: **Experimental** (if the technology is [experimental](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#experimental)), **Deprecated** (if it is [deprecated](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#deprecated_and_obsolete)).
>       - Any other tags that represent terms people might search for related to the technology.
> - **browser-compat**
>   - : Replace the placeholder value <code>css.selectors.NameOfTheSelector</code> with the query string for the selector in the [Browser compat data repo](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data).
>       The toolchain automatically uses the key to populate the compatibility and specifications sections (replacing the `\{{Compat}}` and `\{{Specifications}}` macros in those sections, respectively).
>
>       Note that you may first need to create/update an entry for the selector and its specification in our <a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data">Browser compat data repo</a>.
>       See our [guide on how to do this](/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Compatibility_tables).

> **Top-of-page macros**
>
> A number of macro calls appear at the top of the content section (immediately below the page frontmatter).
> You should update or delete them according to the advice below:
> - `\{{SeeCompatTable}}` — this generates a **This is an experimental technology** banner that indicates the technology is [experimental](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#experimental)).
>   If the technology you are documenting is not experimental, you can remove this.
>   If it is experimental, and the technology is hidden behind a pref in Firefox, you should also fill in an entry for it in the [Experimental features in Firefox](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Experimental_features) page.
> - `\{{Deprecated_Header}}` — this generates a **Deprecated** banner that indicates that use of the technology is [discouraged](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#deprecated_and_obsolete).
>   If it isn't, then you can remove the macro call.
> - `\{{CSSRef}}` — this must be present on every CSS selector page. It generates a suitable CSS sidebar, depending on what tags are included on the page.
>   Remember to remove the `\{{MDNSidebar}}` macro when you copy this page.
>
> ---
>
> **Syntax section (`\{{CSSSyntax}}`)**
>
> The content of the Syntax section is generated using the `\{{CSSSyntax}}` macro.
> For these to populate you must ensure an appropriate entry has been filled in for the selector in our [selectors.json](https://github.com/mdn/data/blob/master/css/selectors.json) data file.
> See [selectors.md](https://github.com/mdn/data/blob/master/css/selectors.md) for more information.
