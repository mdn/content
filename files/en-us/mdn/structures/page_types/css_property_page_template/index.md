> - **title**
>   - : Title heading displayed at top of page. Format as _NameOfTheProperty.
>       For example, the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) property has a title of _background-color_. 
> - **slug**
>   - : The end of the URL path after `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/`). This will be formatted like `Web/CSS/NameOfTheProperty`.
>       For example, the the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) property slug is `Web/CSS/background-color`. 
> - **tags**
>   - : Always include the following tags: **CSS**, **Reference**, **CSS Property**, _NameOfTheProperty_ (e.g. **background-color**).
>
>       Include the following tags as appropriate:
>       - Category of property: **Layout**, **Graphics**, **CSS Background**, **CSS Colors**, _other tags as appropriate_
>       - Technology status: **Experimental** (if the technology is [experimental](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#experimental)), **Deprecated** (if it is [deprecated](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#deprecated_and_obsolete)).
>       - Any other tags that represent terms people might search for related to the technology.
> - **browser-compat**
>   - : Replace the placeholder value <code>css.properties.NameOfTheProperty</code> with the query string for the property in the [Browser compat data repo](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data).
>       The toolchain automatically uses the key to populate the compatibility and specifications sections (replacing the `\{{Compat}}` and `\{{Specifications}}` macros in those sections, respectively).
>
>       Note that you may first need to create/update an entry for the property and its specification in our <a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data">Browser compat data repo</a>.
>       See our [guide on how to do this](/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Compatibility_tables).

> **Top-of-page macros**
>
> A number of macro calls appear at the top of the content section (immediately below the page frontmatter).
> You should update or delete them according to the advice below:
> - `\{{SeeCompatTable}}` — this generates a **This is an experimental technology** banner that indicates the technology is [experimental](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#experimental)).
>   If the technology you are documenting is not experimental, you can remove this.
>   If it is experimental, and the technology is hidden behind a pref in Firefox, you should also fill in an entry for it in the [Experimental features in Firefox](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Experimental_features) page.
> - `\{{Deprecated_Header}}` — this generates a **Deprecated** banner that indicates that use of the technology is [discouraged](/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Conventions_definitions#deprecated_and_obsolete).
>   If it isn't, then you can remove the macro call.
> - `\{{CSSRef}}` — this must be present on every CSS property page. It generates a suitable CSS sidebar, depending on what tags are included on the page.
>   Remember to remove the `\{{MDNSidebar}}` macro when you copy this page.
>

>
> **Formal definition and Formal syntax sections**
>
> The content of the _Formal definition_ and _Formal syntax_ sections is generated in place of `\{{CSSInfo}}` and `\{{CSSSyntax}}` macro, respectively.
> For these to populate you must ensure an appropriate entry has been filled in for the property in our [properties.json](https://github.com/mdn/data/blob/master/css/properties.json) data file.
> See [properties.md](https://github.com/mdn/data/blob/master/css/properties.md) for more information.
