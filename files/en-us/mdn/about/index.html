<p>MDN Web Docs (previously known as MDN — the Mozilla Developer Network) is an evolving learning platform for Web technologies and the software that powers the Web, including:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Web standards such as <a href="/en-US/docs/CSS" title="/en-US/docs/CSS">CSS</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/HTML" title="/en-US/docs/HTML">HTML</a>, and <a href="/en-US/docs/JavaScript" title="/en-US/docs/JavaScript">JavaScript</a></li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Apps" title="/en-US/docs/Apps">Open Web app development</a></li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Add-ons" title="/en-US/docs/Add-ons">Firefox add-on development</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Our_mission">Our mission</h2>

<p>MDN's mission is simple: provide developers with the information they need to easily build projects on the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web">open Web</a>. If it's an open technology exposed to the Web, we want to document it.</p>

<p>We also provide documentation about <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla">Mozilla products</a> and how to <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla">build and contribute to Mozilla projects</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not sure whether a particular topic should be covered on MDN, read <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Does_this_belong">Does this belong on MDN?</a></p>

<h2 id="How_you_can_help">How you can help</h2>

<p>You don't need to be a professional coder or writer to help MDN! We have lots of ways you can help, from reviewing articles to be sure they make sense, to contributing text, to adding sample code. In fact, there are so many ways to help that we have a <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Getting_started">Getting Started</a> page that helps you pick tasks to do based on your interests and how much time you have to spare!</p>

<p>You can also help by <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/About/Promote">promoting MDN</a> on your own blog or website.</p>

<h2 id="The_MDN_community">The MDN community</h2>

<p>Our community is a global one. We have amazing contributors all around the world who work in lots of different languages. If you'd like to learn more about us, or if you need help with MDN, check out our <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/mdn">discussion forum</a> or <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org#mdn">IRC channel</a>!

<h2 id="Using_MDN_Web_Docs_content">Using MDN Web Docs content</h2>

<p>MDN's content is available free of charge, and under open source licenses.</p>

<h3 id="Copyrights_and_licenses">Copyrights and licenses</h3>

<p>MDN's content is entirely available under various open source licenses. This section covers the types of content we provide and what licenses are in effect for each.</p>

<h4 id="Documentation_and_articles">Documentation and articles</h4>

<p><strong>MDN wiki documents</strong> have been prepared with the contributions of authors from both inside and outside the Mozilla Foundation. Unless otherwise indicated, the content is available under the terms of the <a class="external text" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/" rel="nofollow">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license</a> (CC-BY-SA), v2.5 or any later version.</p>

<p>When reusing MDN content, you need to ensure two things:</p>

<ol>
 <li>
  <p>Attribution is given to the original content.</p>

  <p>Please attribute "Mozilla Contributors" and include a hyperlink (online) or URL (in print) to the specific wiki page for the content being sourced. For example, to provide attribution for this article, you can write:</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/About">About MDN</a> by <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/About$history">Mozilla Contributors</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/">CC-BY-SA 2.5</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Note that in the example, "Mozilla Contributors" links to the history of the cited page. See <a href="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/Marking/Users">Best practices for attribution</a> for further explanation.</p>
 </li>
 <li>
  <p>Your reuse is published under the same license as the original content—CC-BY-SA v2.5 or any later version.</p>
 </li>
</ol>

<h4 id="Code_samples_and_snippets">Code samples and snippets</h4>

<p>Code samples added on or after August 20, 2010 are in the <a class="external" href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">public domain</a> (<a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a>). No licensing notice is necessary, but if you need one, you can use: "Any copyright is dedicated to the Public Domain. http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/".</p>

<p>Code samples added to this wiki before August 20, 2010 are available under the <a class="external" href="https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT license</a>; you should insert the following attribution information into the MIT template: "© &lt;date of last wiki page revision&gt; &lt;name of person who put it in the wiki&gt;".</p>

<p>You can determine which license a code sample is available under by browsing through the article's history. To view the history:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Click the <strong>Edit in wiki</strong> button in the article header.  This takes you to the same article on the <a href="https://wiki.developer.mozilla.org">editable, wiki version of MDN Web Docs</a> (but does not actually put the article in edit mode).  </li>
 <li>Click the gear-shaped icon in the header of the wiki article, and choose <strong>History</strong> in the menu that appears.</li>
 <li>Click <strong>View All</strong>, and then look for the most recent revision that occurred before August 20, 2010 (if any).</li>
 <li>Click the date stamp of that revision to see the version of the article on that date.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the sample exists in the revision you selected, then it was added before the licensing changed and is available under the terms of the MIT license. If it is not there, or there are no revisions before August 20, 2010, then it was added after the change and is in the public domain.</p>

Adding to this wiki means you agree that your contributions will be made available under those licenses.</p>

<h2 id="History_of_MDN_Web_Docs">History of MDN Web Docs</h2>

<p>The MDN Web Docs (previously <em>Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</em>, previously <em>Mozilla Developer Center (MDC)</em>, a.k.a. <em>Devmo</em>) project started in early 2005, when the <a class="external" href="https://foundation.mozilla.org">Mozilla Foundation</a> obtained a license from AOL to use the original Netscape <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/devedge.netscape.com" title="Project:en/DevEdge">DevEdge</a> content. The DevEdge content was mined for still-useful material, which was then migrated by volunteers into this wiki so it would be easier to update and maintain.</p>

<p>The name was changed to MDN Web Docs in June 2017. See <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/future-mdn-focus-web-docs/">The Future of MDN: A Focus on Web Docs</a> for the rationale behind this decision.</p>

<p>You can find more history of MDN on our <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN_at_ten">10th anniversary celebration</a> page, including an oral history by some of the people who were involved.</p>
