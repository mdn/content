<p>MDN Web Docs (previously known as MDN — the Mozilla Developer Network) is an evolving learning platform for Web technologies and the software that powers the Web, including <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a>, and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>. We also have a detailed set of beginner's learning material — see <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn">Learn Web development</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Our_mission">Our mission</h2>

<p>MDN's mission is simple: provide developers with the information they need to easily build projects on the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web">open Web</a>. If it's an open technology exposed to the Web, we want to document it.</p>

<p>If you're not sure whether a particular topic should be covered on MDN, read <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Does_this_belong_on_MDN">Does this belong on MDN?</a></p>

<h2 id="How_you_can_help">How you can help</h2>

<p>Our community is a global one. We have amazing contributors all around the world who help us create content, fix bugs, review content changes, and add sample code.</p>

<p>However, you don't need to be a professional coder or writer to help MDN! Head over to our <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute">Contribute</a> pages to find something you can do to help, based on your expertise and how much time you have to spare.</p>

<p>We regularly get users asking us questions about how to link to MDN, or even if doing so is allowed. The short answer is: <strong>yes, you can link to MDN!</strong> Not only is the hypertext link the essence of the Web, it is both a way to point your users to valuable resources and a show of trust toward the work our community does.</p>

<h2 id="History_of_MDN_Web_Docs">History of MDN Web Docs</h2>

<p>The MDN Web Docs (previously <em>Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)</em>, previously <em>Mozilla Developer Center (MDC)</em>, a.k.a. <em>Devmo</em>) project started in early 2005, when the <a class="external" href="https://foundation.mozilla.org">Mozilla Foundation</a> obtained a license from AOL to use the original Netscape <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/devedge.netscape.com" title="Project:en/DevEdge">DevEdge</a> content. The DevEdge content was mined for still-useful material, which was then migrated by volunteers into this wiki so it would be easier to update and maintain.</p>

<p>The name was changed to MDN Web Docs in June 2017. See <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/opendesign/future-mdn-focus-web-docs/">The Future of MDN: A Focus on Web Docs</a> for the rationale behind this decision.</p>

<p>You can find more history of MDN on our <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/At_ten">10th anniversary celebration</a> page, including an oral history by some of the people who were involved, and on our <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/07/mdn-web-docs-15-years-young/">MDN Web Docs: 15 years young</a> blog post, which provides a report on our 15th anniversary!</p>

<p>On December 14 2020, we went through another evolutionary step, migrating to our new Yari platform and storing all of our <a href="https://github.com/mdn/content">content in a GitHub repo</a>. Read <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2020/12/welcome-yari-mdn-web-docs-has-a-new-platform/">Welcome Yari: MDN Web Docs has a new platform</a> for more details.</p>
