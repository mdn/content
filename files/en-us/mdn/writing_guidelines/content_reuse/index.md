{{MDNSidebar}}

In general, we do not approve of copying content from other sources and putting it on MDN.
MDN should be made up of original content wherever possible.
If we receive a pull request and discover that it contains plagiarized content, we will close it and request that the submitter resubmit the change with the content rewritten into their own words.

## If you want to reuse or republish content

> **Note:** Unless there is a good reason to republish the content, we will probably say "no".
> The MDN writing team's decision is final.

If someone wants to donate an article to MDN that they previously published on their blog or it makes sense to copy a complex reference sheet to MDN, there may be justification for republishing it. For these cases, discuss your plan with the MDN team beforehand:

- [Create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/mdn/mdn/issues/new/choose) that explains your intention.
  - Describe what you would like to copy or republish.
  - Provide a URL to the resource.
  - Explain why you think it's appropriate.

**If the content is published under a closed license:**

- If you hold the rights to the content, state this and your express agreement to republish it on MDN.
- If you do not hold the rights to the content, include the author/publisher on the issue if possible, or include details of how they could be contacted so we can ask them for permission to republish the content.

**If the content is published under an open license:**

- Say what it is, and link to the license so we can check whether it is compatible with [MDN's license](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/About#using_mdn_web_docs_content).
