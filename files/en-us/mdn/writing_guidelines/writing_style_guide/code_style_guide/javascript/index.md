The following guidelines cover writing JavaScript example code for MDN Web Docs. This article is a list of rules for writing concise examples that will be understandable by as many people as possible.

## General guidelines for JavaScript code examples

This section explains the general guidelines to keep in mind while writing JavaScript code examples. The later sections will cover more specific details.

### Choosing a format

Opinions on correct indentation, whitespace, and line lengths have always been controversial. Discussions on these topics are a distraction from creating and maintaining content.

On MDN Web Docs, we use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) as a code formatter to keep the code style consistent (and to avoid off-topic discussions). You can consult our [configuration file](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/.prettierrc.json) to learn about the current rules, and read the [Prettier documentation](https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html).

Prettier formats all the code and keeps the style consistent. Nevertheless, there are a few additional rules that you need to follow.

### Using modern JavaScript features

You can use new features once every major browser — Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari — supports them.

### Spacing and indentation

Mark indentation with _2 spaces_. Don't use the tab character. The end-of-line character is `\n`, the Unix convention. To help you, we have included an [`.editorconfig`](https://editorconfig.org/) file in the repository. Many editors read its content and use it to configure their behavior.

## Arrays

### Array creation

For creating arrays, use literals and not constructors.

Create arrays like this:

```js example-good
const visitedCities = [];
```

Don't do this while creating arrays:

```js example-bad
const visitedCities = new Array(length);
```

### Item addition

When adding items to an array, use [`push()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/push) and not direct assignment. Consider the following array:

```js
const pets = [];
```

Add items to the array like this:

```js example-good
pets.push("cat");
```

Don't add items to the array like this:

```js example-bad
pets[pets.length] = "cat";
```

## Asynchronous methods

Writing asynchronous code improves performance and should be used when possible. In particular, you can use:

- [Promises](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)
- [`async`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)/[`await`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)

When both techniques are possible, we prefer using the simpler `async`/`await` syntax. Unfortunately, you can't use `await` at the top level unless you are in an ECMAScript module. CommonJS modules used by Node.js are not ES modules. If your example is intended to be used everywhere, avoid top-level `await`.

## Comments

Comments are critical to writing good code examples. They clarify the intent of the code and help developers understand it. Pay special attention to them.

- If the purpose or logic of the code isn't obvious, add a comment with your intention, as shown below:

  ```js example-good
  let total = 0;

  // Calculate the sum of the four first elements of arr
  for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    total += arr[i];
  }
  ```

  On the other hand, restating the code in prose is not a good use of comments:

  ```js example-bad
  let total = 0;

  // For loop from 1 to 4
  for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    // Add value to the total
    total += arr[i];
  }
  ```

- Comments are also not necessary when functions have explicit names that describe what they're doing. Write:

  ```js example-good
  closeConnection();
  ```

  Don't write:

  ```js example-bad
  closeConnection(); // Closing the connection
  ```

### Use single-line comments

Single-line comments are marked with `//`, as opposed to block comments enclosed between `/* … */`.

In general, use single-line comments to comment code. Writers must mark each line of the comment with `//`, so that it's easier to notice commented-out code visually. In addition, this convention allows to comment out sections of code using `/* … */` while debugging.

- Leave a space between the slashes and the comment. Start with a capital letter, like a sentence, but don't end the comment with a period.

  ```js example-good
  // This is a well-written single-line comment
  ```

- If a comment doesn't start immediately after a new indentation level, add an empty line and then add the comment. It will create a code block, making it obvious what the comment refers to. Also, put your comments on separate lines preceding the code they are referring to. This is shown in the following example:

  ```js example-good
  function checkout(goodsPrice, shipmentPrice, taxes) {
    // Calculate the total price
    const total = goodsPrice + shipmentPrice + taxes;

    // Create and append a new paragraph to the document
    const para = document.createElement("p");
    para.textContent = `Total price is ${total}`;
    document.body.appendChild(para);
  }
  ```

### Output of logs

- In code intended to run in a production environment, you rarely need to comment when you log some data. In code examples, we often use `console.log()`, `console.error()`, or similar functions to output important values. To help the reader understand what will happen without running the code, you can put a comment _after_ the function with the log that will be produced. Write:

  ```js example-good
  function exampleFunc(fruitBasket) {
    console.log(fruitBasket); // ['banana', 'mango', 'orange']
  }
  ```

  Don't write:

  ```js example-bad
  function exampleFunc(fruitBasket) {
    // Logs: ['banana', 'mango', 'orange']
    console.log(fruitBasket);
  }
  ```

- In case the line becomes too long, put the comment _after_ the function, like this:

  ```js example-good
  function exampleFunc(fruitBasket) {
    console.log(fruitBasket);
    // ['banana', 'mango', 'orange', 'apple', 'pear', 'durian', 'lemon']
  }
  ```

### Multi-line comments

Short comments are usually better, so try to keep them in one line of 60–80 characters. If this is not possible, use `//` at the beginning of each line:

```js example-good
// This is an example of a multi-line comment.
// The imaginary function that follows has some unusual
// limitations that I want to call out.
// Limitation 1
// Limitation 2
```

Don't use `/* … */`:

```js example-bad
/* This is an example of a multi-line comment.
  The imaginary function that follows has some unusual
  limitations that I want to call out.
  Limitation 1
  Limitation 2 */
```

### Use comments to mark ellipsis

Skipping redundant code using ellipses (…) is necessary to keep examples short. Still, writers should do it thoughtfully as developers frequently copy & paste examples into their code, and all of our code samples should be valid JavaScript.

In JavaScript, you should put the ellipses (`…`) in a comment. When possible, indicate what action somebody reusing this snippet is expected to add.

Using a comment for the ellipses (…) is more explicit, preventing errors when a developer copies and pastes a sample code. Write:

```js example-good
function exampleFunc() {
  // Add your code here
  // …
}
```

Don't use ellipses (…) like this:

```js example-bad
function exampleFunc() {
  …
}
```

### Comment out parameters

When writing code, you usually omit parameters you don't need. But in some code examples, you want to demonstrate that you didn't use some possible parameters.

To do so, use `/* … */` in the parameter list. This is an exception to the rule to only use single-line comments (`//`).

```js
array.forEach((value, /* index, array */) => {
  // …
});
```

## Functions

### Function names

For function names, use camelCase, starting with a lowercase character. Use concise, human-readable, and semantic names where appropriate.

The following is a correct example of a function name:

```js example-good
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

Don't use function names like these:

```js example-bad
function SayHello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}

function doIt() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```

### Function declarations

- Where possible, use the function declaration over function expressions to define functions.

  Here is the recommended way to declare a function:

  ```js example-good
  function sum(a, b) {
    return a + b;
  }
  ```

  This is not a good way to define a function:

  ```js example-bad
  let sum = function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
  };
  ```

- When using anonymous functions as a callback (a function passed to another method invocation), if you do not need to access `this`, use an arrow function to make the code shorter and cleaner.

  Here is the recommended way:

  ```js example-good
  const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  const sum = array1.reduce((a, b) => a + b);
  ```

  Instead of this:

  ```js example-bad
  const array1 = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  const sum = array1.reduce(function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
  });
  ```

- Consider avoiding using arrow function to assign a function to an identifier. In particular, don't use arrow functions for methods. Use function declarations with the keyword `function`:

  ```js example-good
  function x() {
    // …
  }
  ```

  Don't do:

  ```js example-bad
  const x = () => {
    // …
  };
  ```

- When using arrow functions, use [implicit return](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#function_body) (also known as _concise body_) when possible:

  ```js example-good
  arr.map((e) => e.id);
  ```

  And not:

  ```js example-bad
  arr.map((e) => {
    return e.id;
  });
  ```

## Loops and conditional statements

### Loop initialization

When [loops](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code) are required, choose the appropriate one from [`for(;;)`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for), [`for...of`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of), [`while`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/while), etc.

- When iterating through all collection elements, avoid using the classical `for (;;)` loop; prefer `for...of` or `forEach()`. Note that if you are using a collection that is not an `Array`, you have to check that `for...of` is actually supported (it requires the variable to be iterable), or that the `forEach()` method is actually present.

  Use `for...of`:

  ```js example-good
  const dogs = ["Rex", "Lassie"];
  for (const dog of dogs) {
    console.log(dog);
  }
  ```

  Or `forEach()`:

  ```js example-good
  const dogs = ["Rex", "Lassie"];
  dogs.forEach((dog) => {
    console.log(dog);
  });
  ```

  Do not use `for (;;)` — not only do you have to add an extra index, `i`, but you also have to track the length of the array. This can be error-prone for beginners.

  ```js example-bad
  const dogs = ["Rex", "Lassie"];
  for (let i = 0; i < dogs.length; i++) {
    console.log(dogs[i]);
  }
  ```

- Make sure that you define the initializer properly by using the `const` keyword for `for...of` or `let` for the other loops. Don't omit it. These are correct examples:

  ```js example-good
  const cats = ["Athena", "Luna"];
  for (const cat of cats) {
    console.log(cat);
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
    result += arr[i];
  }
  ```

  The example below does not follow the recommended guidelines for the initialization (it implicitly creates a global variable and will fail in strict mode):

  ```js example-bad
  const cats = ["Athena", "Luna"];
  for (i of cats) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  ```

- When you need to access both the value and the index, you can use `.forEach()` instead of `for (;;)`. Write:

  ```js example-good
  const gerbils = ["Zoé", "Chloé"];
  gerbils.forEach((gerbil, i) => {
    console.log(`Gerbil #${i}: ${gerbil}`);
  });
  ```

  Do not write:

  ```js example-bad
  const gerbils = ["Zoé", "Chloé"];
  for (let i = 0; i < gerbils.length; i++) {
    console.log(`Gerbil #${i}: ${gerbils[i]}`);
  }
  ```

> **Warning:** Never use `for...in` with arrays and strings.

> **Note:** Consider not using a `for` loop at all. If you are using an [`Array`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) (or a [`String`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) for some operations), consider using more semantic iteration methods instead, like [`map()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map), [`every()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/every), [`findIndex()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex), [`find()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find), [`includes()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes), and many more.

### Control statements

There is one notable case to keep in mind for the `if...else` control statements. If the `if` statement ends with a `return`, do not add an `else` statement.

Continue right after the `if` statement. Write:

```js example-good
if (test) {
  // Perform something if test is true
  // …
  return;
}

// Perform something if test is false
// …
```

Do not write:

```js example-bad
if (test) {
  // Perform something if test is true
  // …
  return;
} else {
  // Perform something if test is false
  // …
}
```

### Use braces with control flow statements and loops

While control flow statements like `if`, `for`, and `while` don't require the use of braces when the content is made of one single statement, you should always use braces. Write:

```js example-good
for (const car of storedCars) {
  car.paint("red");
}
```

Don't write:

```js example-bad
for (const car of storedCars) car.paint("red");
```

This prevent forgetting to add the braces when adding more statements.

### Switch statements

Switch statements can be a little tricky.

- Don't add a `break` statement after a `return` statement in a specific case. Instead, write `return` statements like this:

  ```js example-good
  switch (species) {
    case "chicken":
      return farm.shed;
    case "horse":
      return corral.entry;
    default:
      return "";
  }
  ```

  If you add a `break` statement, it will be unreachable. Do not write:

  ```js example-bad
  switch (species) {
    case "chicken":
      return farm.shed;
      break;
    case "horse":
      return corral.entry;
      break;
    default:
      return "";
  }
  ```

- Use `default` as the last case, and don't end it with a `break` statement. If you need to do it differently, add a comment explaining why.

- Remember that when you declare a local variable for a case, you need to use braces to define a scope:

  ```js
  switch (fruits) {
    case "Orange": {
      const slice = fruit.slice();
      eat(slice);
      break;
    }
    case "Apple": {
      const core = fruit.extractCore();
      recycle(core);
      break;
    }
  }
  ```

### Error handling

- If certain states of your program throw uncaught errors, they will halt execution and potentially reduce the usefulness of the example. You should, therefore, catch errors using a [`try...catch`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch) block, as shown below:

  ```js example-good
  try {
    console.log(getResult());
  } catch (e) {
    console.error(e);
  }
  ```

- When you don't need the parameter of the `catch` statement, omit it:

  ```js example-good
  try {
    console.log(getResult());
  } catch {
    console.error("An error happened!");
  }
  ```

> **Note:** Keep in mind that only _recoverable_ errors should be caught and handled. All non-recoverable errors should be let through and bubble up the call stack.

## Objects

### Object names

- When defining a class, use _PascalCase_ (starting with a capital letter) for the class name and _camelCase_ (starting with a lowercase letter) for the object property and method names.

- When defining an object instance, either a literal or via a constructor, use _camelCase_, starting with lower-case character, for the instance name. For example:

  ```js example-good
  const hanSolo = new Person("Han Solo", 25, "male");

  const luke = {
    name: "Luke Skywalker",
    age: 25,
    gender: "male",
  };
  ```

### Object creation

For creating general objects (i.e., when classes are not involved), use literals and not constructors.

For example, do this:

```js example-good
const object = {};
```

Don't create a general object like this:

```js example-bad
const object = new Object();
```

### Object classes

- Use ES class syntax for objects, not old-style constructors.

  For example, this is the recommended way:

  ```js example-good
  class Person {
    constructor(name, age, gender) {
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
      this.gender = gender;
    }

    greeting() {
      console.log(`Hi! I'm ${this.name}`);
    }
  }
  ```

- Use `extends` for inheritance:

  ```js example-good
  class Teacher extends Person {
    // …
  }
  ```

### Methods

To define methods, use the method definition syntax:

```js example-good
const obj = {
  foo() {
    // …
  },
  bar() {
    // …
  },
};
```

Instead of:

```js example-bad
const obj = {
  foo: function () {
    // …
  },
  bar: function () {
    // …
  },
};
```

### Object properties

- The [`Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty) method has been deprecated in favor of [`Object.hasOwn()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwn).
- When possible, use the shorthand avoiding the duplication of the property identifier. Write:

  ```js example-good
  function createObject(name, age) {
    return { name, age };
  }
  ```

  Don't write:

  ```js example-bad
  function createObject(name, age) {
    return { name: name, age: age };
  }
  ```

## Operators

This section lists our recommendations of which operators to use and when.

### Conditional operators

When you want to store to a variable a literal value depending on a condition, use a [conditional (ternary) operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator) instead of an `if...else` statement. This rule also applies when returning a value. Write:

```js example-good
const x = condition ? 1 : 2;
```

Do not write:

```js example-bad
let x;
if (condition) {
  x = 1;
} else {
  x = 2;
}
```

The conditional operator is helpful when creating strings to log information. In such cases, using a regular `if...else` statement leads to long blocks of code for a side operation like logging, obfuscating the central point of the example.

### Strict equality operator

Prefer the [strict equality](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality) (triple equals) and inequality operators over the loose equality (double equals) and inequality operators.

Use the strict equality and inequality operators like this:

```js example-good
name === "Chris";
age !== 25;
```

Don't use the loose equality and inequality operators, as shown below:

```js example-bad
name == "Chris";
age != 25;
```

If you need to use `==` or `!=`, remember that `== null` is the only acceptable case. As TypeScript will fail on all other cases, we don't want to have them in our example code. Consider adding a comment to explain why you need it.

### Shortcuts for boolean tests

Prefer shortcuts for boolean tests. For example, use `if (x)` and `if (!x)`, not `if (x === true)` and `if (x === false)`, unless different kinds of truthy or falsy values are handled differently.

## Strings

String literals can be enclosed within single quotes, as in `'A string'`, or within double quotes, as in `"A string"`. Don't worry about which one to use; Prettier keeps it consistent.

### Template literals

For inserting values into strings, use [template literals](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).

- Here is an example of the recommended way to use template literals. Their use prevents a lot of spacing errors.

  ```js example-good
  const name = "Chris";
  console.log(`Hi! I'm ${name}!`);
  ```

  Don't concatenate strings like this:

  ```js example-bad
  const name = "Chris";
  console.log("Hi! I'm" + name + "!"); // Hi! I'mChris!
  ```

- Don't overuse template literals. If there are no substitutions, use a normal string literal instead.

## Variables

### Variable names

Good variable names are essential to understanding code.

- Use short identifiers, and avoid non-common abbreviations. Good variable names are usually between 3 to 10-character long, but as a hint only. For example, `accelerometer` is more descriptive than abbreviating to `acclmtr` for the sake of character length.
- Try to use real-world relevant examples where each variable has clear semantics. Only fall back to placeholder names like `foo` and `bar` when the example is simple and contrived.
- Do not use the [Hungarian notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation) naming convention. Do not prefix the variable name with its type. For example, write `bought = car.buyer !== null` rather than `bBought = oCar.sBuyer != null` or `name = "John Doe"` instead of `sName = "John Doe"`.
- For collections, avoid adding the type such as list, array, queue in the name. Use the content name in the plural form. For example, for an array of cars, use `cars` and not `carArray` or `carList`. There may be exceptions, like when you want to show the abstract form of a feature without the context of a particular application.
- For primitive values, use _camelCase_, starting with a lowercase character. Do not use `_`. Use concise, human-readable, and semantic names where appropriate. For example, use `currencyName` rather than `currency_name`.
- Avoid using articles and possessives. For example, use `car` instead of `myCar` or `aCar`. There may be exceptions, like when describing a feature in general without a practical context.
- Use variable names as shown here:

  ```js example-good
  const playerScore = 0;
  const speed = distance / time;
  ```

  Don't name variables like this:

  ```js example-bad
  const thisIsaveryLONGVariableThatRecordsPlayerscore345654 = 0;
  const s = d / t;
  ```

> **Note:** The only place where it's allowed not to use human-readable, semantic names is where a very commonly recognized convention exists, such as using `i` and `j` for loop iterators.

### Variable declarations

When declaring variables and constants, use the [`let`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) and [`const`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const) keywords, not [`var`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var). The following examples show what's recommended and what's not on MDN Web Docs:

- If a variable will not be reassigned, prefer `const`, like so:

  ```js example-good
  const name = "Chris";
  console.log(name);
  ```

- If you'll change the value of a variable, use `let` as shown below:

  ```js example-good
  let age = 40;
  age++;
  console.log("Happy birthday!");
  ```

- The example below uses `let` where it should be `const`. The code will work, but we want to avoid this usage in MDN Web Docs code examples.

  ```js example-bad
  let name = "Chris";
  console.log(myName);
  ```

- The example below uses `const` for a variable that gets reassigned. The reassignment will throw an error.

  ```js example-bad
  const age = 40;
  age++;
  console.log("Happy birthday!");
  ```

- The example below uses `var`, polluting the global scope:

  ```js example-bad
  var age = 40;
  var name = "Chris";
  ```

- Declare one variable per line, like so:

  ```js example-good
  let var1;
  let var2;
  let var3 = "Apapou";
  let var4 = var3;
  ```

  Do not declare multiple variables in one line, separating them with commas or using chain declaration. Avoid declaring variables like this:

  ```js example-bad
  let var1, var2;
  let var3 = var4 = "Apapou"; // var4 is implicitly created as a global variable; fails in strict mode
  ```

### Type coercion

Avoid implicit type coercions. In particular, avoid `+val` to force a value to a number and `"" + val` to force it to a string. Use `Number()` and `String()`, without `new`, instead. Write:

```js example-good
class Person {
  #name;
  #birthYear;

  constructor(name, year) {
    this.#name = String(name);
    this.#birthYear = Number(year);
  }
}
```

Don't write:

```js example-bad
class Person {
  #name;
  #birthYear;

  constructor(name, year) {
    this.#name = "" + name;
    this.#birthYear = +year;
  }
}
```

## Web APIs to avoid

In addition to these JavaScript language features, we recommend a few guidelines related to Web APIs to keep in mind.

### Avoid browser prefixes

If all major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari) support a feature, don't prefix the feature. Write:

```js example-good
const context = new AudioContext();
```

Avoid the added complexity of prefixes. Don't write:

```js example-bad
const AudioContext = window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext;
const context = new AudioContext();
```

The same rule applies to CSS prefixes.

### Avoid deprecated APIs

When a method, a property, or a whole interface is deprecated, do not use it (outside its documentation). Instead, use the modern API.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of Web APIs to avoid and what to replace them with:

- Use `fetch()` instead of XHR (`XMLHttpRequest`).
- Use `AudioWorklet` instead of `ScriptProcessorNode`, in the Web Audio API.

### Use safe and reliable APIs

- Do not use {{DOMxRef("Element.innerHTML")}} to insert purely textual content into an element; use {{DOMxRef("Node.textContent")}} instead. The property `innerHTML` leads to security problems if a developer doesn't control the parameter. The more we as writers avoid using it, the fewer security flaws are created when a developer copies and pastes our code.

  The example below demonstrates the use of `textContent`.

  ```js example-good
  const text = "Hello to all you good people";
  const para = document.createElement("p");
  para.textContent = text;
  ```

  Don't use `innerHTML` to insert _pure text_ into DOM nodes.

  ```js example-bad
  const text = "Hello to all you good people";
  const para = document.createElement("p");
  para.innerHTML = text;
  ```

- The `alert()` function is unreliable. It doesn't work in live examples on MDN Web Docs that are inside an {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}. Moreover, it is modal to the whole window, which is annoying. In static code examples, use `console.log()` or `console.error()`. In [live examples](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Live_samples), avoid `console.log()` and `console.error()` because they are not displayed. Use a dedicated UI element.

### Use the appropriate log method

- When logging a message, use `console.log()`.
- When logging an error, use `console.error()`.
