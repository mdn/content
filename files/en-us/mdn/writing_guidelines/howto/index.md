This section of MDN Web Docs writing guidelines contains all the step-by-step information for accomplishing specific tasks when contributing to MDN Web Docs: how we use markdown, how we add an entry to the glossary, how we move or delete pages, and more. To find out more about _how to contribute_ (which happens through GitHub), see our [contribution guidelines](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Contributing).

> **Note:** All the way through this section, we assume that you've read the contribution guidelines, are familiar with the `mdn/content` repository, and know how to use git and GitHub.
