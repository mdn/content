This section of MDN Web Docs writing guidelines contains the step-by-step details for accomplishing specific tasks when contributing to MDN Web Docs: how we use markdown, how we add an entry to the glossary, how we move or delete pages, and more.
To find out about _how to contribute_, see our [contribution guidelines](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community).
These documents assume that you've read the contribution guidelines, are familiar with the `mdn/content` repository, and know how to use git and GitHub.
