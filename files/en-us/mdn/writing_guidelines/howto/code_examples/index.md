## Adding code examples

There are a lot of code examples on MDN, and you'll probably want to add some as you contribute content to the project. This page describes the types of code examples available to use on MDN.

There are four types of code examples used:

- [Static examples](/MDN/Structures/Code_examples#Static_examples)
  — Plain code blocks, possibly with a screenshot to statically show the result of such code if it were to be run.
- [MDN "live samples"](/MDN/Structures/Code_examples#Traditional_live_samples)
  — A macro that takes plain code blocks, dynamically puts them into a document inside an `<iframe>` element, and embeds it into the page to show the code running live.
- [GitHub "live samples"](/MDN/Structures/Code_examples#GitHub_live_samples)
  — A macro that takes a document in a GitHub repo inside the [MDN organization](https://github.com/mdn), puts it inside an `<iframe>` element, and embeds it into the page to show the code running live.
- [Interactive examples](/MDN/Structures/Code_examples#Interactive_examples)
  — Our system for creating live interactive examples that show the code running live but also allow you to change code on the fly to see what the effect is.

For a complete description of this topic, see [the MDN code examples page](/MDN/Structures/Code_examples) and for code style guidance, see the [MDN code example guidelines](/MDN/Guidelines/Code_guidelines).
