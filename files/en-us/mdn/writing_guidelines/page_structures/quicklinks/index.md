{{MDNSidebar}}

MDN supports adding quicklinks to pages. **Quicklinks** are macros that create boxes containing a potentially hierarchical list of links to other pages on MDN or off-site, used in sidebars or in the main content of the page. There are also "quick links" that are macros to enable creating links to properties, APIs, glossary terms, etc. This article describes how to use the different quicklinks macros, demonstrating how to includes sidebars to MDN pages and add always-up-to-date and maintained links within your content. Quickly.

When a quicklink or link macro is included, the server creates a section of content containing an unordered list of links, a definition list of links, or a single link, depending on the macro used. The links created, where they are displayed, and how they are displayed depend on the macro used and the parameters included in the markdown macro call. Some quicklinks include links based on a directory's structure or page type. Others include a list of predefined pages hard-coded in Yari.

You can and often **should** use macros to generate links.
Any time you need to use the same set of quicklinks on more than one page, you should turn them into a macro.

## Creating sidebars

Every page has a sidebar. These sidebars are created by quicklink macros. To include only the content generated by the quicklink macro, the macro is added immediately after the frontmatter and before the content on every page. For example, the first lines of this document are written as:

```md---
title: Quicklinks
slug: MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Quicklinks
page-type: mdn-writing-guide
---

\{{MDNSidebar}}
```

The `\{{MDNSidebar}}` is a quicklink macro that add the MDN sidebar to the page. Because we only want the content from the macro, and no additional content in our sidebar, the macro is placed immediately after the frontmatter.

Here are a few other quicklink macros, with what they do:

- `\{{CSSRef}}`

  - : Present on every CSS page, it generates different CSS sidebars depending on tags, like "properties", "selectors", "at-rules", "descriptors", etc., included in the page.

- `\{{ListSubpagesForSidebar(<parameters>)}}`

  - : Inserts a tree of subpages of the slug of the pages specified as the first parameter. Include two parameters, with the second being `true` or `1`, to display the links as plain text instead of like code. Include a third parameter, set to `true` or `1`, to include the parent page at the top of the list with the link text "Overview".

- `\{{DefaultAPISidebar("<API_Title>")}}`

  - : The API sidebar displayed for overview pages; the single parameter is the name of the API group in GroupData.

- Other sidebar macros
  - : Other sidebar generating macro calls include `\{{GlossarySidebar}}`, `\{{LearnSidebar}}`,`\{{HTMLSidebar}}`, `\{{HTTPSidebar}}`, `\{{PWASidebar}}`, etc.

The appropriate macro to use depends on the page type and is listed in the template for each page type.

### Adding static content to your sidebar quicklinks

Each macro listed above creates sections of links displayed automatically in the sidebar. No additional code is needed to define the location of the list. The macro call needs to be nested within specific HTML to have the list of links add additional content included as a sidebar.

To include a sidebar with additional content — to display content above or below the list of links outputted by a macro — the quicklinks macro must be appended to the end of the page (instead of between the frontmatter and the page content) with the macro call nested in a {{htmlelement("section")}} element with `id="Quick_links"` set.

For example, adding the following at the end of a markdown file will create a sidebar containing the links to all the ARIA role pages, preceded by a link to the ARIA roles overview page:

```md
<section id="Quick_links">

1. [**WAI-ARIA roles**](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles)

   \{{ListSubpagesForSidebar("/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles", "true")}}

</section>
```

> **Note:** To include content in your sidebar along with a quicklink macro, the extra content and the quicklinks macro must be placed at the end of the document. Only one sidebar is created per page, so any macro listed after the frontmatter must be removed.

## Quicklinks within page content

Quicklink macros can also be used to add lists of links to the main area of the page; macros to create generated lists of links are not not limited to sidebars.

- `\{{LandingPageListSubPages()}}`
  - : Inserts a definition list ({{HTMLelement("dl")}}) of the subpages of the current page, with each page's title as the {{HTMLelement("dt")}} term and its SEO summary as the {{HTMLelement("dd")}} term. The optional parameter accepts the slug or the parent page of the directory of pages to output instead of the subpages of the current page.

### Quick links: macros to create single links

In addition to macros that create lists of links, there are macros that quickly create a single link for a CSS, JavaScript, SVG, or HTML feature, including attributes, elements, properties, data types, and APIs. The macros that create single links require at least one parameter: the feature being referenced.

The macros include:

- `\{{CSSxRef("")}}`
- `\{{DOMxRef("")}}`
- `\{{HTMLElement("")}}`
- `\{{JSxRef("")}}`
- `\{{SVGAttr("")}}`
- `\{{SVGElement("")}}`
- `\{{HTTPHeader("")}}`
- `\{{HTTPMethod("")}}`
- `\{{HTTPStatus("")}}`

All the macros accept additional parameters. The second parameter, if present, provides the link text. By default, these links are displayed like code, in a monospace font. To prevent HTML code semantics and CSS code styling, the `"nocode"` parameter can be included as the third value in the macro call.

For example, `\{{CSSxRef("background-color")}}` creates the code link "{{CSSxRef("background-color")}}" and `\{{CSSxRef("At-rules", "CSS at-rule", "nocode")}}` creates the plain text link "{{CSSxRef("At-rules", "CSS at-rule", "nocode")}}".

There is a [list of commonly used macros](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Macros/Commonly_used_macros), each of which outputs links in the main content area of the page.

## Underlying code for MDN macros

There are around 100 [available macros](https://github.com/mdn/yari/tree/main/kumascript/macros). Here are a few standard macros for generating quicklinks and an example of a hardcoded Yari macro list.

- [`CSSRef`](https://github.com/mdn/yari/blob/main/kumascript/macros/CSSRef.ejs)
  - : Builds the standard quicklinks for CSS Reference pages.
- [`HTMLSidebar`](https://github.com/mdn/yari/blob/main/kumascript/macros/HTMLSidebar.ejs)
  - : Builds the standard quicklinks for HTML Reference pages.
- [`QuickLinksWithSubpages`](https://github.com/mdn/yari/blob/main/kumascript/macros/QuickLinksWithSubpages.ejs)
  - : Creates a set of quicklinks using the current page's (or the specified page's) children as the destinations.
    This creates hierarchical lists up to two levels deep.
    The pages' titles are used as the link text and their summaries as tooltips.
