> title: NameOfTheProperty
> slug: Web/CSS/NameOfTheProperty
> page-type: css-property OR css-shorthand-property
> status:
>   - experimental
>   - deprecated
>   - non-standard
> browser-compat: css.properties.NameOfTheProperty

>
> - **title**
>   - : The `title` value is displayed at the top of the page. The title format is _NameOfTheProperty_.
>     For example, the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) property has a title of _background-color_.
> - **slug**
>   - : The `slug` value is the end of the URL path after `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/`. This will be formatted as `Web/CSS/NameOfTheProperty`.
>     For example, the slug for the [`background-color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) property is `Web/CSS/background-color`. For a multi-word component such as `Getting_started` in a slug, the slug should use an underscore as in `/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Getting_started`.
> - **page-type**
>   - : The `page-type` value for CSS properties is `css-property`. For a shorthand CSS property, the value is `css-shorthand-property`. For example, the `page-type` value for the [animation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation) property is `css-shorthand-property` because it is a shorthand property, whereas the `page-type` value for the [animation-delay](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-delay) property is `css-property`.
> - **status**
>   - : Flags describing the status of this feature. An array which may contain one or more of the following: `experimental`, `deprecated`, `non-standard`. This key should not be set manually: it is set automatically based on values in the browser compatibility data for the feature. See ["How to add or update feature statuses"](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Feature_status#how_to_add_or_update_feature_statuses).
> - **browser-compat**
>   - : Replace the placeholder value <code>css.properties.NameOfTheProperty</code> with the query string for the property in the [Browser compat data repo](https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/tree/main/css/properties). Check the _Other macros in the page_ section of this note block to see how this key-value is used to generate content for the _Specifications_ and _Browser compatibility_ sections.
>
> ---
>
> **Top-of-the-page macros**
>
> A number of macro calls appear at the top of the content section (immediately below the page front matter).
> These macros are automatically added by the toolchain (there is no need to add/remove):
>
> - `\{{SeeCompatTable}}`: This macro generates an **Experimental** banner, which indicates that the technology is [experimental](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Experimental_deprecated_obsolete#experimental).
>   If the technology is experimental and is hidden behind a preference in Firefox, you should also fill in an entry for it in the [Experimental features in Firefox](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Experimental_features) page.
> - `\{{Deprecated_Header}}`: This macro generates a **Deprecated** banner, which indicates that the use of the technology is [discouraged](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Experimental_deprecated_obsolete#deprecated).
> - `\{{Non-standard_Header}}` â€” this generates a **Non-standard** banner that indicates that the feature is not part of any specification.
>
> You should update or delete the following macros according to the advice below:
>
> - `\{{CSSRef}}`: This macro must be present on every CSS property page. It generates a suitable CSS sidebar, depending on the tags included on the page.
>   Remember to remove the `\{{MDNSidebar}}` macro when you use this template.
>
> Do not provide status header macros manually. Refer to the section ["How to add or update feature statuses"](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Feature_status#how_to_add_or_update_feature_statuses) to add these statuses to the page.
>
> Samples of the **Experimental**, **Deprecated**, and **Non-standard** banners are shown right after this note block.
>

>
> **Other macros in the page**
>
> - Formal syntax section: The content for the _Formal syntax_ section is generated using the `\{{CSSSyntax}}` macro. This macro fetches data from the specifications using the [@webref/css npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webref/css).
> - Formal definition section: The content for the _Formal definition_ section is generated using the `\{{CSSInfo}}` macro. For this section to have data, you must ensure an appropriate entry has been filled in for the corresponding property in the [properties.json](https://github.com/mdn/data/blob/main/css/properties.json) data file in the `mdn/data` repository. See the [Properties](https://github.com/mdn/data/blob/main/css/properties.md) page for more information.
> - Specifications and Browser compatibility sections: The build tool automatically uses the `browser-compat` key-value pair from the page front matter to insert data into the _Specifications_ and _Browser compatibility_ sections (replacing the `\{{Specifications}}` and `\{{Compat}}` macros in those sections, respectively).
>
>   Note that you may first need to create/update an entry for the property and its specification in our <a href="https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data">Browser compat data repo</a>.
>   See our [compatibility tables guide](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Compatibility_tables) for information on adding or editing entries.

{{CSSRef}}{{SeeCompatTable}}{{Deprecated_Header}}{{Non-standard_Header}}

Begin the content on the page with an introductory paragraph, which names the property and says what it does.
This should ideally be one or two short sentences.

## Try it

_This title is auto-generated by the macro `\{{EmbedInteractiveExample}}`._

This section is for interactive examples added using the `\{{EmbedInteractiveExample}}` macro. You create these examples in the [mdn/interactive-examples repository](https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). See the [Interactive examples](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Code_examples#interactive_examples) section in our _Writing guidelines_ for more information.

## Constituent properties

Add this section only for shorthand properties, such as [animation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation), to list all the related longhand properties.

## Syntax

Include the common use cases as a code block and describe the component subvalues that make up a complete value.

```css
/* Insert code block showing common use cases */
/* or categories of values */
```

### Values

Include one term and definition for each subvalue.

- `subvalue1`
  - : Include a description of the subvalue, its data type, and what it represents.
- `subvalue2`
  - : Include a description of the subvalue, its data type, and what it represents.

## Description

This is an optional section to include a description of the property and explain how it works. Use this section to explain related terms and add use cases for the property.

## Formal definition

`\{{CSSInfo}}`

_To use this macro, remove the backticks and backslash in the markdown file._

## Formal syntax

`\{CSSSyntax}}`

_To use this macro, remove the backticks and backslash in the markdown file._

## Examples

Note that we use the plural "Examples" even if the page only contains one example.

### Add a descriptive heading

Each example must have an H3 heading (`###`) naming the example. The heading should be descriptive of what the example is doing. For example, "A simple example" does not say anything about the example and therefore, not a good heading. The heading should be concise. For a longer description, use the paragraph after the heading.

See our guide on how to add [code examples](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Code_examples) for more information.

> **Note:** Sometimes you will want to link to examples given on another page.
>
> **Scenario 1:** If you have some examples on this page and some more examples on another page:
>
> Include an H3 heading (`###`) for each example on this page and then a final H3 heading (`###`) with the text "More examples", under which you can link to the examples on other pages. For example:
>
> ```md
> ## Examples
>
> ### Using the fetch API
>
> Example of Fetch
>
> ### More examples
>
> Links to more examples on other pages
> ```
>
> **Scenario 2:** If you _only_ have examples on another page and none on this page:
>
> Don't add any H3 headings; just add the links directly under the H2 heading "Examples". For example:
>
> ```md
> ## Examples
>
> For examples of this API, see [the page on fetch()](https://example.org).
> ```
