> **Top-of-the-page macros**
>
> A number of macro calls appear at the top of the content section (immediately below the page front matter).
> These macros are automatically added by the toolchain (there is no need to add/remove):
>
> - `\{{SeeCompatTable}}`: This macro generates an **Experimental** banner, which indicates that the technology is [experimental](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Experimental_deprecated_obsolete#experimental).
>   If the technology is experimental and is hidden behind a preference in Firefox, you should also fill in an entry for it in the [Experimental features in Firefox](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Experimental_features) page.
> - `\{{Deprecated_Header}}`: This macro generates a **Deprecated** banner, which indicates that the use of the technology is [discouraged](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Experimental_deprecated_obsolete#deprecated).
> - `\{{Non-standard_Header}}` â€” this generates a **Non-standard** banner that indicates that the feature is not part of any specification.
>
> You should update or delete the following macros according to the advice below:
>
> - `\{{CSSRef}}`: This macro must be present on every CSS page. It generates a suitable CSS sidebar, depending on the tags included on the page.
>   Remember to remove the `\{{MDNSidebar}}` macro when you use this template.
>
> Do not provide status header macros manually. Refer to the section ["How to add or update feature statuses"](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Feature_status#how_to_add_or_update_feature_statuses) to add these statuses to the page.

> - Formal syntax section: The content for the _Formal syntax_ section is generated using the `\{{CSSSyntax}}` macro. This macro fetches data from the specifications using the [@webref/css npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@webref/css).
> - Specifications and Browser compatibility sections: The build tool automatically uses the `browser-compat` key-value pair from the page front matter to insert data into the _Specifications_ and _Browser compatibility_ sections (replacing the `\{{Specifications}}` and `\{{Compat}}` macros in those sections, respectively).

{{CSSRef}}{{SeeCompatTable}}{{Deprecated_Header}}{{Non-standard_Header}}

Begin the content on the page with an introductory paragraph, which names the function and says what it does.
This should ideally be one or two short sentences.

## Try it

_This title is auto-generated by the macro `\{{EmbedInteractiveExample}}`._

This section is for interactive examples added using the `\{{EmbedInteractiveExample}}` macro. You create these examples in the [mdn/interactive-examples repository](https://github.com/mdn/interactive-examples/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). See the [Interactive examples](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Code_examples#interactive_examples) section in our _Writing guidelines_ for more information.

## Syntax

Include a CSS code block to show the main use cases of the syntax, including examples of parameters that the function can accept. Only include the function itself, not a complete declaration in which it occurs. For example, use `minmax(200px, 1fr)`, not `grid-template-columns: minmax(min-content, 300px)`.

Don't end the syntax lines with semicolons: this should emphasize that we are not showing complete valid CSS code here, just the syntax usage.

Show all the invocation patterns that the function can take. Preceding all such cases, add a comment to describe the use case and another comment to name the parameters and highlight syntax punctuation and the order of parameters. The parameter names in the comment should match the parameters listed in the "Parameters" section.

The comment showing each invocation pattern should be followed by exactly one empty line.

For example:

```css
/* Without a fallback */
/* var( <custom-property-name> ) */
var(--custom-prop)

/* With an empty fallback */
/* var( <custom-property-name> , ) */
var(--custom-prop,)

/* With a fallback value */
/* var( <custom-property-name> , <declaration-value> ) */
var(--custom-prop, initial)
var(--custom-prop, #FF0000)
var(--my-background, linear-gradient(transparent, aqua), pink)
var(--custom-prop, var(--default-value))
var(--custom-prop, var(--default-value, red))
```

### Parameters

List the parameters that the function can accept as a {{htmlelement("dl")}}. List them in the order that they appear in the _Formal syntax_ section. Indicate if a parameter is optional using the `optional_inline` badge.
Include one term and definition for each parameter.

- `<custom-property-name>`
  - : Include a description of the parameter, its data type, and its default value if any.
- `<declaration-value>` {{optional_inline}}
  - : Include a description of the parameter, its data type, and its default value if any.

### Return value

Describe the value returned by the function. Begin the description with the word "Returns"; for example, "Returns a `<number>` or `<dimension>`."

## Description

This section is optional but recommended. It contains a description of the function and explains how it works. Use this section to explain related terms and add use cases for the function.

## Formal syntax

Not all functions have formal syntax: if a function doesn't, omit this whole section.

`\{{CSSSyntax}}`

_To use this macro, remove the backticks and backslash in the markdown file._

## Examples

Note that we use the plural "Examples" even if the page only contains one example.

### Add a descriptive heading

Each example must have an H3 heading (`###`) naming the example. The heading should be descriptive of what the example is doing. For example, "A simple example" does not say anything about the example and therefore, not a good heading. The heading should be concise. For a longer description, use the paragraph after the heading.

See our guide on how to add [code examples](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Code_examples) for more information.

> **Note:** Sometimes you will want to link to examples given on another page.
>
> **Scenario 1:** If you have some examples on this page and some more examples on another page:
>
> Include an H3 heading (`###`) for each example on this page and then a final H3 heading (`###`) with the text "More examples", under which you can link to the examples on other pages. For example:
>
> ```md
> ## Examples
>
> ### Using the polygon() function
>
> Example of polygon()
>
> ### More examples
>
> Links to more examples on other pages
> ```
>
> **Scenario 2:** If you _only_ have examples on another page and none on this page:
>
> Don't add any H3 headings; just add the links directly under the H2 heading "Examples". For example:
>
> ```md
> ## Examples
>
> For examples of this function, see [the page on basic-shape](https://example.org).
> ```

## Accessibility concerns

This is an optional section. You can include any warnings here for accessibility concerns that developers should be aware of while using this function. You can also include workarounds for these accessibility concerns if there are any.

## Specifications
