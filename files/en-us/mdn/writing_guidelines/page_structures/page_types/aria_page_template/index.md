## Page includes

### Title and slug

An ARIA role page should have a `title` and `slug` of `ARIA: Name Of The Role`. For example, the [button role](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/button_role) has a `title` and `slug` of `ARIA/NameOfTheRole_role` and the [aria-labelledby](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby) attribute has a `title` of `aria-labelledby`.

### Top macros

A number of macro calls appear at the top of the content section. You should update or delete them according to the advice below:

- \\{{deprecated_header}}—generates a **Deprecated** banner that indicates the technology is [deprecated](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Experimental_deprecated_obsolete#deprecated_and_obsolete). If it isn't, then you can remove the macro call.
- \\{{ariaref}}—generates a suitable ARIA sidebar, depending on what tags are included on the page.

### Tags

In ARIA role or attribute subpages, you need to include the following tags (see the _Tags_ section at the bottom of the editor UI): **ARIA**, **Reference**, **ARIA Role** or **ARIA Attribute**, _the name of the Role or Attribute_ (e.g. **ARIA button** or **aria-labelledby**), **ARIA widget,** **Experimental** (if the role or attribute is [experimental](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Experimental_deprecated_obsolete#experimental)), and **Deprecated** (if it is [deprecated](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Experimental_deprecated_obsolete#deprecated_and_obsolete)).

### Specifications

In the value of the `spec_urls` frontmatter metadata key, update the URLs to point to the fragment IDs for the correct sections from the following specifications:

- [ARIA](https://w3c.github.io/aria/)
- [ARIA Authoring Practices](https://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/)

Additional resources:

- [Accessibility Object Model](https://wicg.github.io/aom/spec/)
- [ARIA in HTML](https://w3c.github.io/html-aria/)

## Page template

The summary paragraph—start by naming the role or attribute and saying what it does. This should ideally be 1 or 2 short sentences. This content appears as a tool tip on links to this page, so craft it well.

```html
<!-- Insert code block showing common use cases -->
```

(Optional) Include a short description of the preceding example.

## Description

Include a complete description of the attribute or role.

### Associated ARIA roles, states, and properties

- Name of associated roles
  - : Explanation of requirement, link to features pages.
- Name of associated attribute(s)
  - : Explanation of requirement, link to attribute's pages, along with link to JS required to change the value, if appropriate.

### Keyboard interactions

### Required JavaScript features

- Required event handlers
  - : Explanation of each
- Changing attribute values
  - : explanation of each

> **Note:** Include a note about semantic alternatives to using this role or attribute. The first rule of ARIA use is that you can use a native feature with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of re-purposing an element and **adding** an ARIA role, state, or property to make it accessible, then do so. Then post full details in best practices section below.

## Examples

### A descriptive heading

Each example must have an H3 heading (`###`) naming the example. The heading should be descriptive of what the example is doing. For example, "A simple example" does not say anything about the example and therefore, not a good heading. The heading should be concise. For a longer description, use the paragraph after the heading.

See our guide on how to add [code examples](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Page_structures/Code_examples) for more information.

> **Note:** Sometimes you will want to link to examples given on another page.
>
> **Scenario 1:** If you have some examples on this page and some more examples on another page:
>
> Include an H3 heading (`###`) for each example on this page and then a final H3 heading (`###`) with the text "More examples", under which you can link to the examples on other pages. For example:
>
>  ```md
>  ## Examples
>
>  ### Using the fetch API
>  Example of Fetch
>
>  ### More examples
>  Links to more examples on other pages
>  ```
>
> **Scenario 2:** If you _only_ have examples on another page and none on this page:
>
> Don't add any H3 headings; just add the links directly under the H2 heading "Examples". For example:
>
>  ```md
>   ## Examples
>
>   For examples of this API, see [the page on fetch()](https://example.org).
