<p class="c4"><span class="c1">March 5th, 2018</span><br>
 <span class="c1">Issued by: Mozilla</span><br>
 <span>Mozilla Representative: Kadir Topal, </span><span class="c0"><a class="c12" href="mailto:atopal@mozilla.com">atopal@mozilla.com</a></span><span>,</span><span class="c1"> Product Manager for MDN</span></p>

<h2 class="c9" id="Introduction_and_Background"><span class="c10">Introduction and Background</span></h2>

<p class="c4"><span>MDN </span><span>Web Docs (developer.mozilla.org) is a website containing technical documentation that </span><span class="c1">provides web developers with the information they need to build things on the web platform. MDN is in need of a performance audit and is accepting proposals in response to this Request for Proposal in order to find a qualified source to provide that audit.</span></p>

<p class="c4"><span>MDN aligns with Mozilla’s mission, but also helps Mozilla maintain a position of leadership on the web platform. MDN’s KPI</span><span> (Key Performance Indicator)</span><span class="c1"> is the volume of successful sessions that come to MDN. This is the product of our site wide task completion rate and article view sessions [Task Completion Rate] x [Article view sessions]. Currently, MDN has a task completion rate &gt;80% meaning that growth in successful sessions will largely need to come from an increase in site sessions.</span></p>

<p class="c4"><span class="c1">At present, we help solve in excess of 14M developer issues per month across over 16M site sessions per month with 75% of traffic from organic search. These engagements with developers are typified by the following characteristics:</span></p>

<ul class="c7 lst-kix_slv9jznqw1ni-0 start">
 <li class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">Developers enter on a long tail of pages (the top 10 landing pages account for only 7% of total traffic)</span></li>
 <li class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">Their visits are typically limited to one pageview per visit (either it solves their need or it doesn’t but no site engagement is necessarily required)</span></li>
</ul>

<h2 class="c9" id="Project_Goal_and_Target_Audience"><span class="c10">Project Goal and Target Audience</span></h2>

<p class="c4"><span class="c1">Page load performance is an important factor for user engagement and SERP ranking. We know that we haven’t exhausted all options to optimize MDN for page load performance yet, we’d like to know whether there are opportunities that are worth going after and if yes, in what order. The ultimate goal is to increase successful sessions on MDN through improved page load performance for new and repeat visitors.</span></p>

<p class="c4"><span class="c1">Our goal with the MDN performance audit is to:</span></p>

<ol class="c7 lst-kix_hkf9acy2o3xg-0 start" start="1">
 <li class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">Understand what our options are in order to improve page load performance on MDN</span></li>
 <li class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">Understand the cost and impact of those options</span></li>
 <li class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">Set MDN up to act on those options</span></li>
</ol>

<p class="c4"><span>MDN’s audience consists of web developers and others who build things on the web. Currently the top countries are the US, India, China, France, Germany, Japan. China is showing a lot of growth, and we’d like to support that. MDN is multilingual, </span><span>with </span><span>English </span><span>as</span><span class="c1"> the dominant language, but there is significant traffic to Chinese, French and Spanish content. All in all, more than 40 languages are supported on MDN.</span></p>

<h2 class="c9" id="Evaluation_Factors"><span class="c10">Evaluation Factors</span></h2>

<p class="c4"><span class="c1">Mozilla will rate proposals based on the following factors:</span></p>

<ol class="c7 lst-kix_r8vje9o53tla-0 start" start="1">
 <li class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">Responsiveness to the requirements set forth in this Request for Proposal</span></li>
 <li class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">Relevant past performance/experience</span></li>
 <li class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">Samples of work</span></li>
 <li class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">Cost, including an assessment of total cost of ownership</span></li>
 <li class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">Technical expertise/experience of bidder and bidder’s staff</span></li>
</ol>

<p class="c4"><span class="c1">Mozilla reserves the right to award to the bidder that presents the best value to Mozilla as determined solely by Mozilla in its absolute discretion</span></p>

<h2 class="c9" id="Important_Note"><span class="c10">Important Note</span></h2>

<p class="c4"><span>It has been Mozilla’s experience that a Request for Proposal and subsequent proposal response represent an early stage in the contracting process.  Typically, the RFP and response proposals are not drafted in legal language that clearly defines the obligations and rights of the parties. However, Mozilla regards any </span><span>bidder</span><span> proposal submitted in response to this RFP as a commitment to “business terms” that Mozilla might reasonably rely upon as the basis for developing a definitive written agreement between Mozilla and the </span><span>bidder</span><span>.  Mozilla’s normal practice is to mutually negotiate a definitive written agreement, which incorporates legal terms with these business terms.  The definitive agreement will include specific, objective details with respect to the rights and obligations of the parties, including such issues as warranty, financial responsibilities, deliverables, maintenance,</span><span> confidentiality</span><span class="c1"> and protection of Mozilla’s proprietary rights and data.</span></p>

<p class="c4"><span>The material and information enclosed with this RFP are based on current Mozilla requirements, and may change. The information in this RFP does not represent an offer or commitment by Mozilla to procure services. Mozilla reserves the right to modify or withdraw its requirements as expressed herein. Neither Mozilla nor any </span><span>bidder </span><span class="c1">responding to this RFP shall be considered to have entered into a binding agreement regarding the acquisition or provision of equipment, software, and / or services described herein, until and unless the authorized representative of both parties has signed a separate final definitive agreement regarding such equipment, software or services.</span></p>
