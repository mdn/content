The success and growth of the MDN Web Docs project is, in large part, due to our community of contributors. Some contributors have committed a portion of their time to assist with the daily tasks of running MDN Web Docs. Changes to the site, including maintenance tasks, are performed by employees, contractors, and a network of partners who are all dedicated to the health, growth, and maintenance of MDN Web Docs. The project relies heavily on [roles](#roles) and [teams](#teams) in the [MDN organization on GitHub](https://github.com/mdn) to manage and incorporate changes from these different groups. A list of the organization's members can be [found here](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/people).

Community contributions help this open source project immensely.
Contributors can use their work on MDN Web Docs to show their writing, technical, and collaboration skills, and the ability to work with people from diverse backgrounds. This section describes the roles you can take on while volunteering on the MDN Web Docs project.

## Roles

In the MDN Web Docs project, you can take on the role of a [contributor](#contributor), an [organization member](#organization_member), a [maintainer](#maintainer), or an [owner](#owner). The progression from one role to the next is a step-by-step journey.
With the advancement in your responsibilities, you could serve more than one role at the same time.
Roles such as [invited expert](#invited_expert) can be directly obtained if you've demonstrated expertise in a particular area.

Irrespective of the role you take on in this project, you are always a [contributor](#contributor).
A **contributor** is the base role and all other roles are built on top of it.
So while working on this project in any capacity, you must satisfy the requirements of the contributor role.

### Contributor

Contributors, or _community participants_, add to the project with their time, skills, opinions, and ideas.
Contributors work on the project directly and add value to it.
Apart from writing and testing code, contributions include creating and updating documentation, researching, fixing bugs, and helping other community members.

Depending on the frequency of your contributions, you can be someone who contributes occasionally or an active contributor.
If you demonstrate a large impact on the project, you may be nominated as a [spotlight contributor](#spotlight_contributor) or be promoted to an [organization member](#organization_member).

If you're new here and you would like to become a contributor, take a look at our [contribution guide](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) and the [repositories in the MDN GitHub organization](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/repositories).

## Special roles

Some contributor roles have more nuanced responsibilities and have special eligibility conditions. These include [spotlight contributor](#spotlight_contributor), [invited expert](#invited_expert), and [community manager](#community_manager).

### Spotlight contributor

Spotlight contributors are people who have gone above and beyond with their contributions to MDN Web Docs.
Their contributions are in the form of pull requests to improve the project, helping community members on various [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels) or learn forums, or providing feedback on GitHub issues and pull requests.

We feature a spotlight contributor on the [MDN website](/en-US/) once every month.
See the [process](#nominating_a_spotlight_contributor) to nominate someone as a spotlight contributor.

### Invited expert

Invited experts have a track record on MDN for their contributions, participation in discussions and reviews, or have proven knowledge in a certain area of expertise.
Invited experts are responsible for a specific topic area or a component of the MDN project.
They are responsible for reviewing and approving pull requests in their topic or project area, answering technical questions, and maintaining the general health of their particular project. See the [process](#nominating_an_invited_expert) to nominate someone as an invited expert.

In addition to the responsibilities of an [organization member](#organization_member), invited experts are responsible for:

- Following the [reviewing guide](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/REVIEWING.md).
- Reviewing pull requests in their topic area.
- Helping other contributors become reviewers.

Invited experts are automatically assigned for review when pull requests are opened in their topic area.
If there is more than one expert in a topic area, they are assigned to pull requests using a [load-balancing strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-code-review-settings-for-your-team#about-auto-assignment).

**Requirements:**

To be eligible to be an invited expert, you must meet one or more of the following requirements:

- Demonstrated an in-depth knowledge of a particular topic area.
- Committed to being responsible for their assigned topic area.

- Attended the community meeting which takes place once every two months.

**Privileges:**

Invited experts get added to the [invited experts team](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/teams/invited-experts-and-co-maintainers) and to the appropriate topic or project team. Invited experts can:

- Access the required repository for commits and pull request approvals and merges.
- Recommend and vote for other members to become invited experts.
- Attend weekly MDN Web Docs editorial call.

### Community manager

Community managers have a distinct role in many respects.
Community managers share many of the same responsibilities as a [maintainer](#maintainer).
In addition, community managers have the following responsibilities:

- Addressing reports of violation of [Mozilla's code of conduct](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and deciding on the appropriate action.
- Organizing and running community events.
- Organizing community-related project meetings.
- Determining media strategies to promote the MDN project.
- Defining and implementing the contributor onboarding experience.
- Onboarding new contributors and users.
- Ensuring the health and well-being of the MDN project and all participants.
- Identifying and assisting with the implementation of automation to improve project sustainability.
- Meeting and ensuring a healthy relationship with contributors and partners.
- Assisting with issue triage and pull request review where appropriate.
- Monitoring all the [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

### Stepping down or applying for emeritus status

Life happens and your commitment levels as a contributor could change over time. Depending on your situation, you might want to:

- Take a break from the project temporarily.
- Downgrade to a less-demanding role.
- Step away from the project completely (apply for an emeritus status).

In all these situations, feel free to discuss your situation and current commitment levels with the [MDN team](#contact-the-mdn-team).

### Demoting or removing inactive contributors

A contributor can be demoted or removed as a contributor when responsibilities and requirements aren't being met, including repeated patterns of inactivity or a violation of the [code of conduct](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-community/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Demotion or removal of a contributor is proposed by a participant during a maintainers meeting.
The participant provides supporting information for the demotion or removal request.
After discussion, maintainers and community managers vote on the matter to make a decision.

Removing inactive contributors protects the project and its deliverables and also opens up opportunities for new contributors to step in.

We define inactivity as:

- No contributions to the project for at least six months.
- No response to communication for at least three months.

Inactivity harms the project; it may lead to unexpected delays, contributor attrition, and a loss of trust in the project. Contributors must be active to set an example and show commitment to the project.

Please communicate with the community team to avoid demotion or removal should your time commitments change; instead you can proactively choose to [step down for a while or move to emeritus status](#stepping-down-or-applying-for-emeritus-status).

## Teams

We manage teams using the [GitHub teams](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/about-teams) feature. When you are added to a team, it means that you have communicated your intent to be more closely involved in the project. This also means that you have some additional responsibilities and rights, as explained below:

- A person on a team is commonly added to the [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/mdn/content/blob/main/.github/CODEOWNERS) file for their respective topic area(s) of interest.

- When a pull request touches files in your area of responsibility, based on the CODEOWNERS file, you will be added as a reviewer to a pull request automatically using GitHub's [load-balancing algorithm](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams/managing-code-review-settings-for-your-team#routing-algorithms).

- Members of a team have a higher-level repository access. Repository permissions are assigned to only those repositories where a member needs access.

The teams in the [MDN GitHub organization](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/teams) include:

- `@Core`: Core MDN Web Docs team
- `@mdn-community-engagement`: People responsible for community engagement across our repositories
- `@mdn-product`: People responsible for the MDN Plus product
- `@localization-team-leads`: People who lead our individual localization teams
- `@OWD`: Contributors from the Open Web Docs non-profit organization
- `@sre`: Site reliability engineers who support MDN Web Docs
- `@yari-content`: The umbrella team for all MDN Web Docs content reviewers

  - There is a subteam for the different topic areas — accessibility, Add-ons, CSS, HTML, HTTP, JavaScript, SVG, Web API, and WebAssembly. For example, there's `@yari-content-css` and `@yari-content-svg`.
  - There are also subteams for different languages — Brazilian Portuguese, Chinese, French, Japanese, Korean, Russian, and Spanish. For example, there's `@yari-content-fr` and `@yari-content-ko`.

To become a member of a team, you must:

- Agree to abide by our [Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/).
- Agree to Mozilla's [Commit Access Requirements](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/commit/requirements/).
- Set up [two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/configuring-two-factor-authentication) (2FA) on your GitHub account.

<!--
TODO: Update this process because currently there is no issue category on mdn/mdn to request for getting added to a team

If you wish to become a member of a team, you should start by [filing an issue in this repository](https://github.com/mdn/mdn/issues/new/choose).

After you have filed your issue, someone from our team will review it and give you the necessary privileges, provided our requirements are satisfied.
-->
