There are various communication channels using which community can contact MDN Web Docs staff and participate in discussions.

## Chat rooms

Chat rooms are for posting queries, seeking clarifications, sharing information, and meeting other folks.
They are also great place to get to know other community members, share your work, and get help for your contributions.

### Discord server

MDN Web Docs community Discord server is open to the public. This server is a great place to see what staff and members of the community are doing on a daily basis.

You can ask questions, seek clarifications, and find out how you can get involved. You can also join specific channels based on your areas of interest or expertise.

Join the MDN Web Docs community on Discord [here](https://discord.gg/hkGN8VKvvD).

### Matrix chat rooms

The Matrix chat rooms are an alternative to the Discord server.

## GitHub Discussions

[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions) on MDN Web Docs is the place to look out for any project-wide [announcements](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions/categories/announcements).

Use GitHub discussions to post your questions and propose your suggestions. Choose the appropriate [discussion category](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-community#github-discussions) when starting a thread. Your answered questions can be really useful for other people looking for similar information in the future.

We strongly recommend you to use GitHub Discussions to share the work you're planning to do and that you think will need a consensus on the course of action. You can also use GitHub Discussions for brainstorming your ideas to define an actionable piece of work, especially when the changes have a wide-ranging impact.

Check out the MDN-specific [discussion guidelines](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Discussions) before you create a new submission.
