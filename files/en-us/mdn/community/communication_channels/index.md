There are various communication channels using which community can contact MDN Web Docs staff and participate in discussions.

## Chat rooms

Chat rooms are for queries, clarifications, sharing information, and meetings.
They are also great places to get to know other community members, share your work, and get help for your contributions.
If you have a question or want to get in touch with us about something, feel free to join us.

### Discord server
As of January 2023, MDN Web Docs opened up a Discord server to the public.
This server is a great place to see what staff and members of the community are doing on a daily basis and to find out how you can get involved.
