Since December 14th 2020, MDN has been running on the new GitHub-based [Yari platform](https://github.com/mdn/yari). This has a lot of advantages for MDN, but we've needed to make radical changes to the way in which we handle localization. This is because we've ended up with a lot of unmaintained and out-of-date content in our non-English locales, and we want to manage it better in the future.

We have archived all locales, EXCEPT for the ones listed below, meaning that they are read-only on GitHub and cannot be viewed on MDN. The active locales have dedicated teams taking responsibility for maintaining them.

## How to contribute

If you want to contribute to one of the existing active locales, check out the [mdn/translated-content GitHub repository](https://github.com/mdn/translated-content). This repository contains all of the localized documents for all active locales, as well as issue tracking. We recommend reading the [translation guide](https://github.com/mdn/translated-content/tree/main/docs) first.

If you need help or have any questions, feel free to get in touch with one of the active members or communities listed below, or [contact us](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).
