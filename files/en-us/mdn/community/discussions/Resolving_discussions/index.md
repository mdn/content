MDN Web Docs is an open source project. The community is encourage to initiate, engage in, and resolve discussions related to the MDN Web Docs documentation.

At times, people will have differing views. If a discussion is controversial or otherwise requires a resolution before action is taken (or to decide to not take action), community members are encouraged to seek input and work together with interested parties toward a resolution.

These steps provide guidance to achieve a resolution with maximum community input in a reasonable amount of time.

## Discussion guidelines

If you are proposing new content or features, please [open a new issue]. If you are suggesting changes to processes or other changes that would benefit from or need input from our partners and the wider community, please [start a discussion]().

Most discussions do not need a formal resolution process. These MDN discussion guidelines are here for the discussions that aren't moving forward toward a conclusion or would otherwise benefit from a formal process:

1. Each discussion is held / rooted in a https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions, which is the "source of truth" for the topic.

2. Each topic of discussion needs a driver. The driver is responsible for:

   - Guiding the conversation.
   - Making people aware that the discussion exists.
   - Setting the timeline, informing people of it, changing the timeline as necessary, and sticking to the timeline as appropriate.
   - Informing all the appropriate channels - slack, discord, and other channels if appropriate - of needed feedback by specific dates.
   - Bring up the topic in community and weekly meetings.
   - Organizing face-to-face if required (if there is disagreement). Face-to-face meetings should be rare and only if required.
   - Summarizing face-to-face conclusions in the relevant discussion on https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions
   - Guiding the implementation of the discussion results or working with the appropriate team lead to ensure that the results are implemented.

3. Face-to-face meetings regarding a discussion should only be called if there is disagreement.

   - Face-to-face meetings must be announced in all communication channels (slack, discord, /discussions/)
   - Conclusions of each face-to-face meeting must be entered into the /discussion, which remains as the source of truth for the topic
   - Driver is responsible for calling the meeting, informing all parties, reporting results back into the /discussion
