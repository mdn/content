The MDN community is encourage to [initiate, engage in, and resolve discussions](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Discussions) related to the MDN Web Docs documentation.

While many discussions reach broad agreement very quickly, others may stall if there is no clear path to resolution: for example due to conflicting opinions.
This process explains how you can work with the community in order to progress discussions through to resolution in a reasonable timeframe.

## Moving a discussion to a resolution

Most discussions do not need a formal resolution process. These MDN discussion guidelines are here for the discussions that aren't moving forward toward a conclusion or would otherwise benefit from a formal process:

1. Each discussion is held / rooted in a [discussion on Github](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions), which is the "source of truth" for the topic.

2. Each topic of discussion needs a driver. The driver is responsible for:

   - Guiding the conversation.
   - Making people aware the discussion exists.
   - Setting the timeline, informing people of it, changing the timeline as necessary, and sticking to the timeline as appropriate.
   - Informing all the appropriate channels - slack, discord, tagging people Github, and other channels if appropriate - of needed feedback by specific dates.
   - Bring up the topic in community and weekly meetings.
   - Organizing a synchronous, online face-to-face meeting if required (if there is disagreement). Face-to-face meetings should be rare and only if required (See #3).
   - Summarizing face-to-face conclusions in the relevant discussion on https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions within the relevant discussion.
   - Guiding the implementation of the discussion results or working with the appropriate team lead to ensure that the results are implemented.

3. Face-to-face meetings regarding a discussion should only be called if there is disagreement.

   - Face-to-face meetings must be announced in all [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels) (Slack, Discord, GitHub discussion, etc.).
   - Conclusions of each face-to-face meeting must be entered into the GitHub discussion, which remains as the source of truth for the discussion.
   - The driver is responsible for calling the meeting, informing all parties, reporting results back into the GitHub discussion.

Once agreement has been achieved, the discussion can be closed, the resolution announced, and the plan for implementing the resolution can be put it into action!

## Discussion timeline

Every discussion will follow a different timeline depending on the complexity of the topic, the levels of agreement and disagreement, and the parties involved. Most discussions should be resolved in two months, allowing for the topic to be addressed at two monthly and / or nine weekly meetings, while ensuring that people with differing views have to opportunity to hear about and contribute to the discussion.

1. Post the discussion and assign a driver.
2. Identify any key stakeholders and needed approvers (the individuals who need to weigh in on the topic and give their approval), if any.
3. Inform the approvers and other essential voices of the discussion and your proposed timeline. If needed, reach out to them again after 2 weeks, and weekly thereafter, until they provide feedback.
4. Add the discussion topic to the agendas of relevant meetings.
5. After a month, sort through the feedback, discussions, and agreements, and formalate an initial plan merging the feedback into a possible action plan. Re-inform and re-request feedback from all interested parties, including everyone who participated in the discussion in any way.
6. During the second month, keeping reaching out the the community for feedback on the proposed plan, making updates to the plan in light of any new feedback. Rinse. Repeat.
7. If there are points of contention, arrange an online, synchronous, face-to-face meeting to resolve any remaining disagreements (as captured in the discussion thread).
8. Keep the discussion threads alive during the second month as you work with the community towards the resolution.
9. [Create an issue](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Issues) with the final plan for implementing the resolution and put it into action.
10. Close the discussion.

If the discussion involves reaching out to and receiving feedback from experts, the timeline above can be extended as needed.
