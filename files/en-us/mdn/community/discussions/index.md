On MDN Web Docs, we encourage our community to start and/or engage in discussions around topics related to the overall project. Discussions are categorized by different topic areas. We ask that you keep each discussion focused on the topic at hand instead of covering multiple topics in one discussion.

**Note:** `mdn-community/discussions` is not the place to report problems.
If you see something wrong on MDN Web Docs, it's best to open a GitHub issue in the [relevant MDN GitHub repository](https://github.com/mdn/).
If you're not sure whether to open an issue or start discussion, consider the following guidelines:

- Issues should be used for reporting a bug or a work item with clearly defined and actionable tasks and outcomes.
- Use Discussions when an issue requires a dialogue to agree upon a course of action or define an actionable piece of work.
- If your discussion doesn't progress or you're unsure of the next steps, refer to the [Guidelines for managing and resolving discussions](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Discussions/Managing_and_resolving_discussions) for advice on moving forward, including expectations on timelines.

Check out the subject of each discussion category below so that you can start your discussion in the proper place.
