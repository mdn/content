On MDN Web Docs, we encourage our community to start and engage in discussions around topics related to the project.
We ask that you keep each discussion focused on the topic at hand instead of covering multiple subjects in a discussion.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't use GitHub Discussions to report bugs.
> If you see something wrong on MDN Web Docs, open a GitHub issue in the [the relevant GitHub repository](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Our_repositories).

If you're not sure whether to open a GitHub issue or discussion, here's what each are for:

- **Issues** are for reporting bugs or tracking a work item with defined and actionable tasks and outcomes.
- **Discussions** are for reaching consensus about how we're working and for defining tasks.

If your discussion doesn't progress or you're unsure of the next steps, refer to the [Guidelines for managing and resolving discussions](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Discussions/Managing_and_resolving_discussions) for advice on moving forward, including expectations on timelines.

Check out the subject of each discussion category below so that you can start your discussion in the proper place.

| Discussion Category                  | Subject                                                                                                                                                                               |
