### Purpose

Participating in MDN Web Docs projects means adhering to the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines (CPG)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). These guidelines exist to foster a welcoming, inclusive, and safe environment, and to ensure that every community member feels valued, heard, and protected.

This document describes how to report violations and what happens depending on the severity of a violation.

### Guiding Principles

- **Transparency:** Address every report clearly and consistently.
- **Confidentiality:** Protect reporter privacy unless explicit consent is given to share information.
- **Proportionality:** Responses to violations are proportionate to the harm caused.
- **Restorative Justice:** Repair harm and foster learning.

## Code of Conduct Violations and Enforcement Ladder

MDN Community Management investigates the severity of behavior based on a report, then determines and carries out any actions, if appropriate.
Violations follow a step-by-step escalation process, and the reportee is informed of consequences at leach level.
In serious cases, enforcement may skip levels up to and including an immediate, permanent ban.

Below is a summary of severity levels and enforcement actions.

### Level 0: No Action

- **Severity:** There is no clear indication a violation of the CPG.
- **Actions:** No formal action taken. Feedback is provided to the reporter, reportee, or both, to promote good behavior and positive interactions.

### Level 1: Simple Warning Issued

- **Severity:** Minor violations of the CPG.
- **Actions:** A private, written warning from project leadership, with clarity of the violation and consequences of continued behavior.

### Level 2: Warning

- **Severity:** Moderate violation of the CPG, or repeated minor violations.
- **Actions:**
  - A private, written warning with clarity of the violation and consequences of continued behavior.
  - Guidance on rectification of aggrieving situation, if applicable.
  - Communication of next-level consequences if behaviors are repeated.

### Level 3: Warning + Mandatory Cooling Off Period (Tool Access Revoked - GH & Discord)

- **Severity:** Continued violations or escalation in severity.
- **Actions:**
  - A private warning with clarity of the violation and consequences of continued behavior.
  - Request to avoid interaction on community messaging platforms (public forums, commenting on bugs).
  - Required to not interact with others involved in the report or those suspected to be involved.
  - This includes avoiding any interactions in Mozilla channels, spaces/offices, and external channels like social media (e.g., following/liking/retweeting).

## Reporting Process

### How to Report a violation

Reports should be sent to mdn-cpg-report@mozilla.com.
Include any relevant details, including date, time, description of the violation.
Include identifying information of the offender and screenshots, if possible.

### Investigation

MDN Community Management investigate all reports confidentially.
When necessary, further information may be requested from the involved parties.

### Decision Making

MDN Community Management assess the severity of the violation, apply the enforcement actions as outlined, and communicate the outcome to relevant parties.

### Appeals

If a reported individual believes the decision was unjust, they may appeal through the [appeals process detailed on the community page].
Appeals are reviewed by a separate, impartial panel.

### Documentation and Record Keeping

All incidents will be documented to ensure consistency and fairness.
Records of violations and actions taken are kept private, and accessible only by MDN Community Management.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### What happens if a violation involves an edge-case scenario?

Behavior that's inappropriate but is not explicitly described by the project's Code of Conduct are assessed individually.
The enforcement team will make a judgment based on the context and the principles of fairness, transparency, and proportionality.

Examples include:

- **Anonymous Reports:** These reports are investigated with extra care to validate the claims while maintaining fairness.
- **Reports Involving Leadership Members:** A separate impartial panel will handle these cases to avoid conflicts of interest.
- **Interactions During Cooling-Off Periods:** Violations during a cooling-off period, such as unintentional online interactions, may be considered differently, with an emphasis on intent and harm caused.

### Updates to CPG

The CPG process is a living document that evolves with the community. Feedback is welcome on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions), [Discord](https://mdn.dev/discord), and changes will be communicated on the community page.
