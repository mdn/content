### Purpose

MDN is governed by the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/). The Community Participation Guidelines (CPG) exist to foster a welcoming, inclusive, and safe community. This document outlines clear processes for reporting violations and the actions that will be taken by the enforcement team. Our focus is to ensure that every community member feels valued, heard, and protected.

### Guiding Principles

- **Transparency:** Every report is addressed clearly and consistently.
- **Confidentiality:** Reporters' privacy will be protected unless explicit consent is given to share information.
- **Proportionality:** The response to violations will be proportionate to the harm caused.
- **Restorative Justice:** Where possible, the process aims to repair harm and foster learning.

## Code of Conduct Violations and Enforcement Ladder

The CPG outlines several categories of violations. These are summarized below along with appropriate enforcement actions. The enforcement process follows an escalation ladder, where individuals are made aware of future consequences each time an action is taken. The ladder is not strictly linearâ€”depending on the severity of the violation, escalation may skip levels or result in an immediate ban.

### Level 0: No Action

- **Description:** Recommendations do not indicate a violation of the CPG.
- **Actions:** No formal action taken, but feedback may be provided to promote positive behavior.

### Level 1: Simple Warning Issued

- **Description:** Minor violations of the CPG.
- **Actions:** A private, written warning from project leadership, with clarity of the violation and consequences of continued behavior.

### Level 2: Warning

- **Description:** Repeated minor violations or a single moderate violation of the CPG.
- **Actions:**
  - A private, written warning from project leadership, with clarity of the violation and consequences of continued behavior.
  - Communication of next-level consequences if behaviors are repeated.

### Level 3: Warning + Mandatory Cooling Off Period (Tool Access Revoked - GH & Discord)

- **Description:** Continued violations or escalation in severity.
- **Actions:**
  - A private warning from project leadership, with clarity of the violation and consequences of continued behavior.
  - Request to avoid interaction on community messaging platforms (public forums, commenting on bugs).
  - Required to not interact with others involved in the report or those suspected to be involved.
  - This includes avoiding any interactions in Mozilla channels, spaces/offices, and external channels like social media (e.g., following/liking/retweeting).

### Level 4: Ban across MDN and Mozilla Spaces, All Areas Permanent Ban

- **Description:** Permanent ban from all Mozilla activities and spaces
- **Actions:**
  - Private communication of ban from project leadership, with clarity of the violation and consequences of continued behavior.
  - Required to avoid interaction on community messaging platforms and external channels.
  - All Mozilla accounts will be deactivated permanently.
  - Not allowed to enter Mozilla digital and event spaces permanently.
  - All community leadership roles will be permanently suspended.
  - Permission to use the Mozilla trademark is revoked.

## Reporting Process

### How to Report

Reports can be submitted via mdn-cpg-report@mozilla.com. The report should include all relevant details (e.g., date, time, description, screenshots).

### Investigation

The enforcement team will investigate all reports confidentially. When necessary, further information may be requested from the involved parties.

### Decision Making

The team will assess the severity of the violation, apply the enforcement actions as outlined, and communicate the outcome to relevant parties.

### Appeals

If a reported individual believes the decision was unjust, they may appeal through the [appeals process detailed on the community page]. Appeals are reviewed by a separate, impartial panel.

### Enforcement Team

The enforcement team is composed of trusted community members and Mozilla staff, trained in conflict resolution and equipped to handle sensitive issues.

### Documentation and Record Keeping

All incidents will be documented to ensure a consistent approach to enforcement.
Records of violations and actions taken are kept private, and accessible only by the enforcement team.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

### What happens if a violation involves an edge-case scenario?

Edge-case scenarios, which may not fit perfectly within the described enforcement ladder, will be assessed individually. The enforcement team will make a judgment based on the context and the principles of fairness, transparency, and proportionality. Examples include:

- **Anonymous Reports:** These reports are investigated with extra care to validate the claims while maintaining fairness.
- **Reports Involving Leadership Members:** A separate impartial panel will handle these cases to avoid conflicts of interest.
- **Interactions During Cooling-Off Periods:** Violations during a cooling-off period, such as unintentional online interactions, may be considered differently, with an emphasis on intent and harm caused.

### Updates to CPG

The CPG process is a living document that evolves with the community. Feedback is welcome on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions), [Discord](https://mdn.dev/discord), and changes will be communicated on the community page.
