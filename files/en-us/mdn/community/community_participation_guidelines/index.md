Participating in MDN Web Docs projects means adhering to the [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines (CPG)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/).
These guidelines exist to foster a welcoming, inclusive, and safe environment, and to ensure that every community member feels valued, heard, and protected.

This document describes how to report violations and what happens depending on the severity of a violation.

## Guiding principles

- **Transparency:** Address every report clearly and consistently.
- **Confidentiality:** Protect reporter privacy unless explicit consent is given to share information.
- **Proportionality:** Responses to violations are proportionate to the harm caused.
- **Restorative Justice:** Repair harm and foster learning.

## Code of Conduct violations and enforcement ladder

The MDN Community Management team ([`@mdn/community`](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/teams/community) on GitHub) investigates the severity of behavior based on a report, then determines and carries out any actions, if appropriate.
Violations follow a step-by-step escalation process, and the reportee is informed of consequences at leach level.
In serious cases, enforcement may skip levels up to and including an immediate, permanent ban.

Below is a summary of severity levels and enforcement actions.

### Level 0: No action

- **Severity:** There is no clear indication a violation of the CPG.
- **Actions:** No formal action taken. Feedback is provided to the reporter, reportee, or both, to promote good behavior and positive interactions.

### Level 1: Simple warning issued

- **Severity:** Minor violations of the CPG.
- **Actions:** A private, written warning from project leadership, with clarity of the violation and consequences of continued behavior.

### Level 2: Formal warning issued

- **Severity:** Moderate violation of the CPG, or repeated minor violations.
- **Actions:**
  - A private, written warning with clarity of the violation and consequences of continued behavior.
  - Guidance on rectifying the situation, if possible.
  - Communication of next-level consequences if behaviors are repeated.

### Level 3: Warning and mandatory cooling-off period

- **Severity:** Continued violations or escalation in severity.
- **Actions:**
  - A private warning with clarity of the violation and consequences of continued behavior.
  - No interaction on community messaging platforms, such as public forums, commenting on bugs.
  - No interaction with people involved in the report or others suspected to be involved.
  - Access to GitHub and Discord temporarily revoked.
  - Avoid interactions in Mozilla channels, physical spaces and offices, and online channels like social media (e.g., following/liking/re-posting).
  - The reportee has the opportunity to participate in the project again after onboarding that clarifies expected behavior.

### Level 4: Permanent ban across MDN and Mozilla spaces

- **Severity:** Serious [Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines (CPG)](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) breaches.
- **Actions:**
  - Private communication of a ban from project leadership, with clarity of the violation and warning of consequences. Should the behavior continue, it would lead to a ban from all Mozilla community spaces.
  - Required to avoid interaction on community messaging platforms and external channels.
  - Deactivation of any and all Mozilla accounts.
  - Permanently banned from entering Mozilla digital and event spaces.
  - Permanently suspended from any and all community leadership roles.
  - Revocation of any and all permissions to use the Mozilla trademark.

## Reporting process

### Reporting violations

Reports can be sent to mdn-cpg-report@mozilla.com.
To report a violation or abuse on GitHub, see [GitHub's content reporting guide](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/maintaining-your-safety-on-github/reporting-abuse-or-spam).
The **"Report to repository admins"** option must be checked for the MDN team to see a content report.

Include any relevant details, including date, time, and description of the violation.
Include identifying information of the offender and screenshots, if possible.

### Investigation

MDN Community Management investigates all reports confidentially.
When necessary, further information may be requested from the involved parties.

### Decision making

MDN Community Management assesses the severity of the violation, applies the enforcement actions as outlined, and communicates the outcome to relevant parties.

### Appeals

Once an incident has been investigated and a decision has been communicated to the relevant parties, all have the opportunity to appeal this decision by sending an email to mdn-cpg-report@mozilla.com.
Appeals are reviewed by a separate, impartial panel.

### Documentation and record keeping

All incidents will be documented to ensure consistency and fairness.
Records of violations and actions taken are kept private and accessible only by MDN Community Management.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Common questions are answered below.
If anything else about CPG reports and processes is unclear or unanswered, get in touch via one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

### What happens if a violation involves an edge-case scenario?

Behavior that's inappropriate but is not explicitly described by the project's Code of Conduct are assessed individually.
The enforcement team will make a judgment based on the context and the principles of fairness, transparency, and proportionality.

Examples include:

- **Anonymous reports:** These reports are investigated with extra care to validate the claims while maintaining fairness.
- **Reports involving leadership members:** A separate impartial panel will handle these cases to avoid conflicts of interest.
- **Interactions during cooling-off periods:** Violations during a cooling-off period, such as unintentional online interactions, may be considered differently, with an emphasis on intent and harm caused.

### How is CPG maintained over time?

The CPG process is a living document that evolves with the community. Feedback is welcome on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/mdn/discussions), [Discord](https://mdn.dev/discord), and changes will be communicated on the community page.
