<div>{{MDNSidebar}}</div><p class="summary">The editor's toolbar offers features that let you adjust the appearance and flow of the article as you work. This article describes each of the controls in the toolbar.</p>

<p>There are two rows of buttons and a third row that shows the context of HTML elements leading up to where you are. In the screenshot below, for example, you're writing inside a top-level <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/p" title="The HTML &lt;p&gt; element represents a paragraph of text."><code>&lt;p&gt;</code></a> block.</p>

<p><img alt="Screenshot of the toolbar, with labels for the button groups" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15269/toolbar-labeled.png" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 2px; float: right; height: 142px; width: 725px;">The toolbar's buttons are divided into nine groups. Let's look at each; we will examine the buttons in each group in order left-to-right.</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="#Document_group">Document</a></li>

<h2 id="Document_group">Document group</h2>

<p>The document group provides options for document-level manipulations.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Source</dt>
 <dd>The <strong>Source</strong> button lets you toggle between editing using the WYSIWYG interface and editing in raw HTML source mode. We <em>strongly</em> request that you try to avoid using source mode, as it's very easy to wind up with content that doesn't match our style guide or, worse, doesn't work right at all. Currently, though, the editor has some quirks that make it impossible to do certain things without resorting to source mode. See <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Editor/Source_mode">Using source mode in the MDN editor</a> for details on how to use source mode and the dos and don'ts involved.</dd>
 <dt>Publish</dt>
 <dd>Just like the main <strong>Publish</strong> button.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="note">
<p>If you try to save your edit and your changes are rejected as invalid, but the content is in fact appropriate for MDN, you should <a href="mailto:mdn-spam-watch@mozilla.com?subject=MDN%3A%20Content%20Rejection%20Appeal&amp;body=%3CDescribe%20the%20content%20you%20were%20trying%20to%20save%20and%20where%20you%20were%20trying%20to%20place%20it.%3E">email the writing team</a> for help getting your content posted.</p>
</div>

<dl>
 <dt>Preview</dt>
 <dd>Just like the main <strong>Preview</strong> button.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Edit_functions_group">Edit functions group</h2>

<p>The edit functions are similar to their corresponding options on a typical application's <strong>Edit</strong> menu.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Paste</dt>
 <dd>Pastes the contents of the system clipboard into the editor pane.</dd>
 <dt>Paste as plain text</dt>
 <dd>Opens a dialog into which you can paste text; the text has all styling stripped from it so that you don't inadvertently introduce unwanted styles into the site content. Once you've pasted your text, you can (optionally) make changes, then click a button to insert it into the article you're working on.</dd>
 <dd>
 <div class="note">
 <p>When pasting content into MDN, please be aware that, if pasting styled content (including, for example, syntax highlighting in code being copied from another site), you may be bringing along unwanted and unneeded additional styles or classes. Please be careful not to do this; if necessary, review your edit in source mode to remove these unnecessary styles and classes (or check it before pasting, or use the "Paste as plain text" option instead).</p>
 </div>
 </dd>
 <dt>Undo</dt>
 <dd>Undoes the last operation.</dd>
 <dt>Redo</dt>
 <dd>Redoes the last undone operation.</dd>

 <dt>Show blocks</dt>
 <dd>This button causes outlines to appear around block elements in your document. This can be a handy way to check the document structure without going into source mode.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Inline_styles_group">Inline styles group</h2>

<p>The inline styles group contains common inline styles that you may wish to apply to chunks of text.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Bold</dt>
 <dd>Toggles <strong>boldface</strong> text mode. It creates a {{htmlelement("strong")}} element.</dd>
 <dt>Italic</dt>
 <dd>Toggles <em>italic</em> text mode. It creates an {{htmlelement("em")}} element.</dd>
 <dt>Underline</dt>
 <dd>Toggles <u>underlined</u> text mode. It creates a {{htmlelement("u")}} element.</dd>
 <dt>Strike through</dt>
 <dd>Toggles <s>strikethrough</s> mode. It creates an {{htmlelement("s")}} element.</dd>
 <dt>Subscript</dt>
 <dd>Toggles subscript mode. It creates a {{htmlelement("sub")}} element.</dd>
 <dt>Superscript</dt>

 <dt>Remove format</dt>
 <dd>Removes the current inline styles from the selection.</dd>
 <dt>Code</dt>
 <dd>Toggles <code>code </code>mode. It creates a {{htmlelement("code")}} element. This is used for inline presentation of variable names, function names, object names, filenames, and so forth.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Hyperlinking_group">Hyperlinking group</h2>

<p>The hyperlinking group provides options related to hyperlinking.</p>

 <dt>Unlink</dt>
 <dd>Removes the link at the insertion point.</dd>
 <dt>Anchor</dt>
 <dd>Creates an anchor at the insertion point. Note that you don't need an anchor to link to a heading; the MDN editor automatically creates an <code>{{htmlattrxref("id")}}</code> for each heading that is the same as the heading text, with spaces replaced by underscores. For example, the heading of this section has an <code>id</code> whose value is <code>Hyperlinking_group</code>.</dd>
 <dt>Create a redirect</dt>
 <dd>Inserts a redirect from this page to another. See <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Editor/Redirects#Creating_redirects">Creating redirects</a> for further information.</dd>
</dl>

</div>

<dl>
 <dt>Two columns</dt>

 <dt>Syntax box</dt>
 <dd>Creates a syntax box, such as the one shown below. You need to use the "PRE" button as well, to create a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre" title='The HTML &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;pre> element represents preformatted text. Text within this element is typically displayed in a non-proportional ("monospace") font exactly as it is laid out in the file. Whitespace inside this element is displayed as typed.'><code>&lt;pre&gt;</code></a> block inside it. You probably won't see the yellow box until you do.</dd>
 <dt>Hidden when reading</dt>
 <dd>Creates a block that is visible only in edit mode, not when normally displayed. This is not the same as an HTML comment, which is visible only in source mode.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Inline_styles">Inline styles</h3>

<dl>
 <dt>SEO summary</dt>
 <dd>This special style is used to indicate a sentence or two that should be used as the article's summary for SEO purposes. It's also used by macros that automatically construct landing pages. If you don't specify this, MDN automatically uses the first paragraph of your article, but sometimes that's not the optimal text (or it's too much text), so this lets you override that.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Blocks_group">Blocks group</h2>

<p>The blocks group contains options for other block styles, some of which are standard HTML, and some of which are unique to Kuma.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Blockquote</dt>
 <dd>Inserts a blockquote. <strong>Please do not use this</strong>. Blockquotes are not part of our standard style guide, and this button will be removed in the near future.</dd>
 <dt>Preformatted Text</dt>

By default, H2 through H4 are included in the table of contents, but you can change this, as described in the <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Editor/Basics/Page_info">page info box</a>.</dd>
 <dt>Syntax highlighter</dt>
 <dd>The syntax highlighter lets you choose a language for which to apply syntax highlighting to the {{htmlelement("pre")}} (preformatted text) block; if you're not already in such a block, this will create one for you.  Choose the language used in the  block, and it will be highlighted appropriately.</dd>
 <dt>Insert Code Sample Template</dt>
 <dd>This button is used by the live sample system to help you quickly insert a new live sample. You don't need to use it, but it's there for convenience. See <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Structures/Live_samples#Using_the_live_sample_system">Using the live sample system</a> for details on using this and other live sample features.</dd>
 <dt>Insert Code Sample iFrame</dt>

<p>The block structures group provides options to create or modify standard block structures.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Insert/remove numbered list</dt>
 <dd>Creates or removes a numbered list from your article. Once you're working in a numbered list, each time you press return, you will start a new bullet. The <kbd>Tab</kbd> key can be used to indent a level, and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> will outdent a level. Pressing return on an empty bullet will exit numbered list mode.
