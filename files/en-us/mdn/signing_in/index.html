<p><span class="seoSummary">Whenever you wish to make changes to MDN's content (such as editing, creating, or adding tags to pages), you need to be signed in. This article will explain the process of signing in and the authentication methods we support for identifying you as an MDN contributor.</span></p>

<div class="note">
<p>Currently we support only <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for authenticating and logging into MDN; if you don't have a GitHub login attached to your MDN account, see <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Link_a_GitHub_account">How to link a GitHub account to your MDN profile</a> to learn how to update your account.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Signing_in">Signing in</h2>

<p>MDN uses third-party authentication services to sign in to the site for contribution purposes. When not signed in, you'll see at the top of the screen the "Sign in" box, which shows icons for each of the authentication services we support.</p>

<p><img alt="Sign in box on MDN" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/14299/mdn-signin-button.png" style="border-style: solid; border-width: 1px; height: 115px; width: 408px;"></p>

<p>Click the Sign In button to start the login process. If you don't already have a GitHub account, you will need to create one. See <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Create_an_MDN_account">How to create an MDN account</a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Link_a_GitHub_account">How to link a GitHub account to your MDN profile</a> for additional details, if you get stuck.</p>

<h2 id="Authentication_services">Authentication services</h2>

<p>While MDN is designed to support multiple authentication methods, we currently support only <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<div class="warning">
<p>If your MDN account doesn't have a GitHub login attached to it, you'll need to add one in order to continue to log in and edit MDN content. See <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Link_a_GitHub_account">How to link a GitHub account to your MDN profile</a> for details.</p>
