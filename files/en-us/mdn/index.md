**MDN Web Docs** is free-to-use resource on which we document the open web platform. Our mission is to provide _developers_ with the _information_ they need to _easily_ build projects on the _web platform_.

This is the landing page for the MDN Web Docs project itself. Here you'll find guides on how the site works, how we do our documentation, the guidelines and conventions we adhere to, and how you can help.

We invite everyone to help! MDN Web Docs is an open-source project and accepts contributions. There are many different tasks you can help with, from the simple (proof-reading and correcting typos) to the complex (writing API documentation).

If you want to talk to us and ask questions, join the discussion on the [MDN Web Docs chat room](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#mdn:mozilla.org) on [Matrix](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Matrix).
