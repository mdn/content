## Using MDN Web Docs content

MDN Web Doc's content is available free of charge, and under open source licenses.

## Copyrights and licenses

MDN's content is entirely available under various open source licenses. This section covers the types of content we provide and what licenses are in effect for each.

### Linking to MDN

We regularly get users asking us questions about how to link to MDN, or even if doing so is allowed. The short answer is: **yes, you can link to MDN!** Not only is the hypertext link the essence of the Web, it is both a way to point your users to valuable resources and a show of trust toward the work our community does.

### Documentation and articles

> **Note:** MDN content has been prepared with the contributions of authors from both inside and outside Mozilla. Unless otherwise indicated, the content is available under the terms of the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/) (CC-BY-SA), v2.5 or any later version.

When reusing MDN content, you need to ensure two things:

1. Attribution is given to the original content.

    Please attribute "Mozilla Contributors" and include a hyperlink (online) or URL (in print) to the specific page of the content being sourced. For example, to provide attribution for _this_ article, you can write:

    > [MDN Attributions and copyright licensing](/en_US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Attrib_copyright_license) by [Mozilla Contributors](/en-US/docs/MDN/About/contributors.txt) is licensed under [CC-BY-SA 2.5](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.5/).

    Note that in the example, "Mozilla Contributors" links to the history of the cited page. See [Best practices for attribution](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/Marking/Users) for further explanation.

2. Your reuse is published under the same license as the original content—CC-BY-SA v2.5 or any later version.

### Code samples and snippets

Code samples added on or after August 20, 2010 are in the [public domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) ([CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)). No licensing notice is necessary, but if you need one, you can use: "Any copyright is dedicated to the Public Domain. http\://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/".

Code samples added before August 20, 2010 are available under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php); you should insert the following attribution information into the MIT template: "© \<date of last wiki page revision> \<name of person who put it in the wiki>".

Since the launch of the new Yari MDN platform on December 14 2020, there is currently no way to determine which one you need. We are working on this and will update this content soon.

### Contributions

If you wish to contribute to MDN Web Docs, you agree your documentation is available under the Attribution-ShareAlike license (or occasionally an alternative license already specified by the page you are editing), and your code samples available under [Creative Commons CC-0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) (a Public Domain dedication).

> **Warning:** No new pages may be created using alternate licenses.

**Copyright for contributed materials remains with the author unless the author assigns it to someone else**.

If you have any questions or concerns about anything discussed here, please [contact us]().

### Logos, trademarks, service marks and wordmarks

The rights in the trademarks, logos, and service marks of the Mozilla Foundation, as well as the look and feel of this website, are not licensed under the Creative Commons license, and to the extent they are works of authorship (like logos and graphic design), they are not included in the work that is licensed under those terms. If you use the text of documents, and wish to also use any of these rights, or if you have any other questions about complying with our licensing terms for this collection, you should contact the Mozilla Foundation here: [licensing@mozilla.org](mailto:licensing@mozilla.org "mailto:licensing@mozilla.org").

## Content from elsewhere

Often, there is useful content about a topic somewhere on the web besides MDN Web Docs.
However, copying such content can be fraught with difficulties, both technical and legal.

On the technical level, search engines typically penalize a site in their rankings for reproducing content available elsewhere.
Therefore, it is preferable to have original content on MDN Web Docs to enhance the search engine ranking of MDN Web Docs' content.
You can link to the existing content from MDN Web Docs.

On the legal level, you must be authorized to contribute the content, and it must be licensed and attributed in a way that is compatible with MDN's license.

- **If you created the existing content** (for your own purposes and not as work-for-hire), and you are willing to contribute it to MDN Web Docs under MDN's license, this is the easiest case, and you are free to contribute the content.
- **If the copyright for the content belongs to someone else**, it must be licensed and attributed compatibly with MDN's license.
  It is often not easy for someone who is not a lawyer to determine what licenses are compatible.
  To be on the safe side, contact a member of the [MDN Web Docs team](https://github.com/mdn/mdn-community/discussions), who may consult Mozilla's Legal team for guidance if necessary.
