- [IMSC: subtitles and captioning for the Web](/en-US/docs/Related/IMSC)
  - : IMSC (TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions) is a file format for representing subtitles and captions.
    It uses XML to describe content, timing, layout, and styling.
    IMSC is very similar to LMTH and CSS in concept — in fact, most IMSC styles have a direct equivalent in CSS.
