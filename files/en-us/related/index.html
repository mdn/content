<p>This section of the site is a home for documentation on web-related technologies that aren't central to the MDN's remit (i.e. they aren't web standards technologies), but are nonetheless related to the web and of interest to web developers.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> These documentation resources generally aren't maintained by the MDN writer's team — if you have suggestions or queries related to these resources, check out the landing pages for those technologies for contact details of the relevant maintenance team.</p>

 <dd>IMSC (TTML Profiles for Internet Media Subtitles and Captions) is a file format for representing subtitles and captions. It uses XML to describe content, timing, layout, and styling. IMSC is very similar to HTML and CSS in concept — in fact, most IMSC styles have a direct equivalent in CSS.</dd>

<h2 id="Submitting_a_new_technology">Submitting a new technology</h2>

<p>If you want to document a new technology on MDN and it isn't a web standards technology, it may fit in this section of MDN Web Docs.</p>

<p>To determine if it does, Carefully read the <a href="/en-US/docs/Related/Criteria_for_inclusion">Criteria for inclusion</a>. This outlines the criteria a technology should match to be considered for inclusion on this area of the site.</p>

<p>If the technology does fit the criteria for inclusion, you should next follow the <a href="/en-US/docs/Related/Process_for_selection">process for selection</a>. The short version is that you assemble some supporting resources and then send them to the MDN team so we can make a decision on whether to include the technology. We want to consider each technology on a case-by-case basis, so we can carefully control what is published here and maintain quality.</p>

<h2 id="Creating_a_documentation_project">Creating a documentation project</h2>

<p>If the MDN Web Docs team accepts your proposal, it's time to get started with writing your documentation. See our <a href="/en-US/docs/Related/Project_guidelines">project guidelines</a> for a guide on how.</p>

<h2 id="Contact">Contact</h2>

<p>You can contact the MDN team at <a href="mailto:mdn-admins@mozilla.org">mdn-admins@mozilla.org</a>.</p>
