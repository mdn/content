<p class="summary">The <strong>WebOTP API</strong> provides a method for verifying that a phone number belongs to the user, by generating a one-time password on receipt of a specially formatted SMS message.</p>

<h2> Concepts and Usage</h2>

<p>Phone numbers are often used as a way to identify the user of an app, and to verify that the number belongs to the user, SMS is frequently deployed. A typical scenario would involve a message being sent to the user with a one-time password. They would then need to copy and paste that password into a form to verify that the user owns the number.</p>

<p>The WebOTP API removes friction from this process by allowing the password to be received by the app and verified automatically, with no need to copy and paste any codes.</p>

</dl>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>In this example, when an SMS message arrives, and the user grants permission, an {{domxref("OTPCredential")}} object is returned with a one-time password. This password is then prefilled into the form field, and the form submitted.</p>

      input.value = otp.code;
      if (form) form.submit();
    }).catch(err => {
      console.log(err);
    });
  });
