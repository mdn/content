<p><span class="seoSummary">The {{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats")}} property
    <strong><code>availableOutgoingBitrate</code></strong> returns a value indicative of
    the available outbound capacity of the network connection represented by the candidate
    pair.</span> The higher the value, the more bandwidth you can assume is available for
  outgoing data.</p>

<p>You can get the incoming available bitrate from
  {{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.availableIncomingBitrate",
  "availableIncomingBitrate")}}.</p>

<pre
  class="brush: js"><em>availableOutgoingBitrate</em> = <em>rtcIceCandidatePairStats</em>.availableOutgoingBitrate;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A floating-point value which approximates the amount of available bandwidth for
  outgoing data on the network connection described by the
  <code>RTCIceCandidatePair</code>. The value is reported in bits per second and is
  computed over a 1-second interval.</p>

<p>The returned value is <code>undefined</code> in each of the following situations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The underlying implementation doesn't support computing a sender-side estimate of
    the outgoing bit rate.</li>
  <li>The {{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePair")}} described by this object has never been used.
  </li>
  <li>The candidate pair was once in use, but no longer is.</li>
</ul>

<p>The value returned is calculated by adding up the available bit rate for every
  {{Glossary("RTP")}} stream using the connection described by this candidate pair. The
  returned value doesn't take into account overhead introduced by underlying protocols,
  including IP, UDP, or TCP.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The returned value is computed using a method similar—but not
    identical—to the Transport Independent Application Specific Maximum (TIAS) described
    in {{RFC(3890, "6.2")}}.</p>
