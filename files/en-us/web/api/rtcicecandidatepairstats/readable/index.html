<p><span class="seoSummary">The <em>obsolete</em> {{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats")}}
    property <strong><code>readable</code></strong> reports whether or not the connection
    described by the candidate pair has received at least one valid incoming ICE
    request.</span></p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js"><em>isReadable</em> = <em>rtcIceCandidatePairStats</em>.readable;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A Boolean value which is <code>true</code> if the connection described by this
  candidate pair has received at least one valid ICE request, and is therefore ready to be
  read from.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This property was removed from the specification in early 2017
    because you can determine whether or not the connection is readable by checking to see
    if {{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.requestsReceived", "requestsReceived")}} is
    greater than 0:</p>

  <pre class="brush: js">if (icpStats.requestsReceived &gt; 0) {
  /* at least one ICE request has been received */
}</pre>
