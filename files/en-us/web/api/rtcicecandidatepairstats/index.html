<p><span class="seoSummary">The WebRTC <code><strong>RTCIceCandidatePairStats</strong></code> dictionary reports statistics which provide insight into the quality and performance of an {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}} while connected and configured as described by the specified pair of {{Glossary("ICE")}} candidates.</span></p>

<p>If a {{domxref("RTCStats")}}-based object's {{domxref("RTCStats.type", "type")}} is <code>candidate-pair</code>, it's an <code>RTCIceCandidatePairStats</code> object.</p>

<h2 id="Properties">Properties</h2>

<p><em><code>RTCIceCandidatePairStats</code> is based upon {{domxref("RTCStats")}} and inherits its properties. In addition, it adds the following new properties:</em></p>

<dl>
 <dt>{{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.availableIncomingBitrate", "availableIncomingBitrate")}} {{optional_inline}}</dt>
 <dd>Provides an informative value representing the available inbound capacity of the network by reporting the total number of bits per second available for all of the candidate pair's incoming {{Glossary("RTP")}} streams. This does not take into account the size of the {{Glossary("IP")}} overhead, nor any other transport layers such as {{Glossary("TCP")}} or {{Glossary("UDP")}}.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.availableOutgoingBitrate", "availableOutgoingBitrate")}} {{optional_inline}}</dt>
 <dd>Provides an informative value representing the available outbound capacity of the network by reporting the total number of bits per second available for all of the candidate pair's outoing {{Glossary("RTP")}} streams. This does not take into account the size of the {{Glossary("IP")}} overhead, nor any other transport layers such as {{Glossary("TCP")}} or {{Glossary("UDP")}}.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.bytesReceieved", "bytesReceieved")}} {{optional_inline}}</dt>

 <dt>{{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.consentExpiredTimestamp", "consentExpiredTimestamp")}} {{optional_inline}}</dt>
 <dd>A {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} value indicating the time at which the most recent STUN binding response expired.

 <dt>{{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.consentRequestsSent", "consentRequestsSent")}} {{optional_inline}}</dt>
 <dd>The total number of consent requests that have been sent on this candidate pair.</dd>

 <dd>A {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} value indicating the time at which the last packet was sent from the local peer to the remote peer for this candidate pair. Timestamps are not recorded for STUN packets.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.lastRequestTimestamp", "lastRequestTimestamp")}} {{optional_inline}}</dt>

 <dt>{{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.lastResponseTimestamp", "lastResponseTimestamp")}} {{optional_inline}}</dt>
 <dd>A {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} value that specifies the time at which the last (most recent) STUN response was received by the local candidate from the remote candidate in this pair.</dd>

 <dt>{{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.nominated", "nominated")}} {{optional_inline}}</dt>
 <dd>A Boolean value which, if <code>true</code>, indicates that the candidate pair described by this object is one which has been proposed for use, and will be (or was) used if its priority is the highest among the nominated candidate pairs. See {{RFC(5245, "", "7.1.3.2.4")}} for details.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.packetsReceived", "packetsReceived")}} {{optional_inline}}</dt>

<h3 id="Obsolete_properties">Obsolete properties</h3>

<p>The following properties have been removed from the specification and should no longer be used. You should update any existing code to avoid using them as soon as is practical. Check the {{anch("Browser compatibility", "compatibility table")}} for details on which browsers support them and in which versions.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>{{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.priority", "priority")}} {{deprecated_inline}} {{optional_inline}}</dt>
 <dd>An integer value indicating the candidate pair's priority.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.readable", "readable")}} {{deprecated_inline}} {{optional_inline}}</dt>
 <dd>A Boolean value indicating whether or not data can be sent over the connection described by the candidate pair.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.writable", "writable")}} {{deprecated_inline}} {{optional_inline}}</dt>
 <dd>A Boolean value indicating whether or not data can be received on the connection described by the candidate pair.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Non-standard_properties">Non-standard properties</h3>

<dl>
 <dt>{{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.selected", "selected")}} {{non-standard_inline}} {{optional_inline}}</dt>
 <dd>A Firefox-specific Boolean value which is <code>true</code> if the candidate pair described by this object is the one currently in use. The spec-compliant way to determine the selected candidate pair is to look for a stats object of type <code>transport</code>, which is an {{domxref("RTCTransportStats")}} object. That object's {{domxref("RTCTransportStats.selectedCandidatePairId", "selectedCandidatePairId")}} property indicates whether or not the specified transport is the one being used.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<p>The currently-active ICE candidate pair—if any—can be obtained by calling the {{domxref("RTCIceTransport")}} method {{domxref("RTCIceTransport.getSelectedCandidatePair", "getSelectedCandidatePair()")}}, which returns an {{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePair")}} object, or <code>null</code> if there isn't a pair selected. The active candidate pair describes the current configuration of the two ends of the {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}}.</p>

<p>Any candidate pair that isn't the active pair of candidates for a transport gets deleted if the {{domxref("RTCIceTransport")}} performs an ICE restart, at which point the {{domxref("RTCIceTransport.state", "state")}} of the ICE transport returns to <code>new</code> and negotiation starts once again. For more information, see {{SectionOnPage("/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Session_lifetime", "ICE restart")}}.</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>This example computes the average time elapsed between connectivity checks if the {{domxref("RTCStats")}} object <code>rtcStats</code> is an <code>RTCIceCandidatePairStats</code> object.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">if (rtcStats &amp;&amp; rtcStats.type === "candidate-pair") {
  let elapsed = (rtcStats.lastRequestTimestamp - rtcStats.firstRequestTimestamp)
                  / rtcStats.requestsSent;

  log("Average time between ICE connectivity checks: " + elapsed + " ms.");
}
</pre>

<p>The code begins by looking at <code>rtcStats</code> to see if its {{domxref("RTCStats.type", "type")}} is <code>candidate-pair</code>. If it is, then we know that <code>rtcStats</code> is in fact an {{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats")}} object. If so, we compute the average time elapsed between STUN connectivity checks and log that information.</p>
