<p><span class="seoSummary">The {{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats")}} dictionary's
    <strong><code>totalRoundTripTime</code></strong> property is the total time that has
    elapsed between sending {{Glossary("STUN")}} requests and receiving the responses, for
    all such requests that have been made so far on the pair of candidates described by
    this <code>RTCIceCandidatePairStats</code> object.</span> This value includes both
  connectivity check and consent check requests.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js"><em>totalRTT</em> = <em>rtcIceCandidatePairStats</em>.totalRoundTripTime;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>


<p>This floating-point value indicates the total number of seconds which have elapsed
  between sending out STUN connectivity and consent check requests and receiving their
  responses, for all such requests made so far on the connection described by this
  candidate pair.</p>

<p>You can calculate the average round-trip time (RTT) by dividing this value by the value
  of the {{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.responsesReceived", "responsesReceived")}}
  property:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">rtt = rtcIceCandidatePairStats.totalRoundTripTime /
        rtcIceCandidatePairStats.responsesReceived;</pre>
