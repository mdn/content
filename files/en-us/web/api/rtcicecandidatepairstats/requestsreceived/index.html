<p><span class="seoSummary">The {{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats")}} dictionary's
    <strong><code>requestsReceived</code></strong> property indicates the total number of
    {{Glossary("STUN")}} connectivity check requests that have been received so far on the
    connection described by this pairing of candidates.</span></p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js"><em>requestsReceived</em> = <em>rtcIceCandidatePairStats</em>.requestsReceived;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>An integer value which specifies the number of STUN connectivity and/or consent
  requests that have been received to date on the connection described by this pair of
  {{Glossary("ICE")}} candidates.</p>

<p>Because there's no way to tell the difference between requests made to check
  connectivity and requests made to check consent, the returned figure includes both.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The reported number of requests includes retransmissions. If a
    request had to be repeated due to network issues, it will be counted multiple times
    here. This differs from {{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.requestsSent",
    "requestsSent")}}, which <em>does not</em> include retransmisions.</p>
