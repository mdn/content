<p><span class="seoSummary">The {{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats")}} property
    <strong><code>nominated</code></strong> specifies whether or not the candidate pair
    described by the underlying <code>RTCIceCandidatePair</code> has been nominated to be
    used as the configuration for the WebRTC connection.</span></p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js"><em>nominated</em> = <em>rtcIceCandidatePairStats</em>.nominated;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A Boolean value which is set to <code>true</code> by the ICE layer if the controlling
  user agent has indicated that the candidate pair should be used to configure the WebRTC
  connection between the two peers.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> If more than one candidate pair are nominated at the same
    time, the one whose priority is higher will be selected for use.</p>
</div>

<p>Once a candidate pair has been nominated and the two peers have each reconfigured
  themselves to use the specified configuration, the ICE negotiation process can
  potentially end (or it can continue, to allow the connection to adapt to changing
  conditions).</p>
