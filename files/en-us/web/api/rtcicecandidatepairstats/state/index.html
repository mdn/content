<p><span class="seoSummary">The <code><strong>state</strong></code> property in an
    {{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats")}} object indicates the state of the check list
    of which the candidate pair is a member.</span></p>

<pre
  class="brush: js"><em>state</em> = <em>rtcIceCandidatePairStats</em>.state;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A {{domxref("DOMString")}} whose value is one of those found in the
  {{domxref("RTCStatsIceCandidatePairState")}} enumerated type.</p>

<h2 id="ICE_check_lists">ICE check lists</h2>

<p>During ICE negotiation, the ICE layer builds up a <strong>check list</strong>, which is
  a list of potential pairings of ICE candidates. Each pair has a state, whose value is
  represented by <code>RTCStatsIceCandidatePairState</code>.</p>

<p><img

    src="ice-check-list-states.svg"></p>

<p>When a candidate pair is added to the check list, it begins in the <code>frozen</code>
  state. As soon as there are no checks ongoing which block the pair from being analyzed,
  it is unfrozen and moves into the <code>waiting</code> state. This may happen
  immediately upon being added to the check list.</p>

<p>Each time a candidate pair is done being checked, the next-highest priority candidate
  pair remaining on the check list moves from the <code>waiting</code> state to the
  <code>in-progress</code> state, and its check begins. If the check fails for any reason,
  the pair moves into its final state, <code>failed</code>. If the check succeeds, the
  pair ends up in the <code>succeeded</code> state.</p>

<p>The ICE check list state for any given pair of ICE candidates can be found in the
  corresponding the <code>state</code> property.</p>
