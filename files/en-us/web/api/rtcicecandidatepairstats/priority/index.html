<p><span class="seoSummary">The <em>obsolete</em> {{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats")}}
    property <code><strong>priority</strong></code> reports the priority of the candidate
    pair as an integer value.</span> The higher the value, the more likely the WebRTC
  layer is to select the candidate pair when the time comes to establish (or re-establish)
  a connection between the two peers.</p>
