<pre

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A floating-point value indicating the round-trip time, in seconds for the connection
  described by the pair of candidates for which this <code>RTCIceCandidatePairStats</code>
  object offers statistics.</p>

<p>This value is computed by observing the time that elapsed between the most recent
  {{Glossary("STUN")}} request being sent to the remote peer and the response to that
  request arriving. This information may come from ongoing STUN connectivity checks as
  well as from consent requests made when the connection was initially being opened.</p>
