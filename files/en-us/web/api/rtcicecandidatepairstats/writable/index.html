<p><span class="seoSummary">The <em>obsolete</em> {{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats")}}
    property <strong><code>writable</code></strong> reports whether or not the connection
    described by the candidate pair is writable.</span></p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js"><em>isWritable</em> = <em>rtcIceCandidatePairStats</em>.writable;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A Boolean value which is <code>true</code> if the connection described by this
  candidate pair has received acknowledgement of receipt (ACK) for at least one ICE
  request <em>and</em> that {{Glossary("STUN")}} consent hasn't expired.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This property was removed from the specification in early 2017
    because you can determine whether or not an incoming ICE request is available to read
    by checking to see if {{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.responsesReceived",
    "responsesReceived")}} is greater than 0 and that the time specified by
    {{domxref("RTCIceCandidatePairStats.consentExpiredTimestamp",
    "consentExpiredTimestamp")}} has not passed:</p>

  <pre class="brush: js">if (icpStats.responsesReceived &gt; 0
    &amp;&amp; icpStats.consentExpiredTimestamp &lt; performance.now()) {
  /* at least one ICE response has been received */
}</pre>
