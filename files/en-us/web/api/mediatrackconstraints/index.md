{{APIRef("Media Capture and Streams")}}

The **`MediaTrackConstraints`** dictionary is used to describe a set of capabilities and the value or values each can take on. A constraints dictionary is passed into {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints", "applyConstraints()")}} to allow a script to establish a set of exact (required) values or ranges and/or preferred values or ranges of values for the track, and the most recently-requested set of custom constraints can be retrieved by calling {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.getConstraints", "getConstraints()")}}.

## Constraints

The following types are used to specify a constraint for a property. They allow you to specify one or more `exact` values from which one must be the parameter's value, or a set of `ideal` values which should be used if possible. You can also specify a single value (or an array of values) which the user agent will do its best to match once all more stringent constraints have been applied.

To learn more about how constraints work, see [Capabilities, constraints, and settings](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Streams_API/Constraints).

### ConstrainBoolean

The `ConstrainBoolean` constraint type is used to specify a constraint for a property whose value is a Boolean value. Its value may either be set to a Boolean (`true` or `false`) or an object containing the following properties:

- `exact`
  - : A Boolean which must be the value of the property. If the property can't be set to this value, matching will fail.
- `ideal`
  - : A Boolean specifying an ideal value for the property. If possible, this value will be used, but if it's not possible, the user agent will use the closest possible match.

### ConstrainDouble

The `ConstrainDouble` constraint type is used to specify a constraint for a property whose value is a double-precision floating-point number. Its value may either be set to a number or an object containing the following properties:

- `max`
  - : A decimal number specifying the largest permissible value of the property it describes. If the value cannot remain equal to or less than this value, matching will fail.
- `min`
  - : A decimal number specifying the smallest permissible value of the property it describes. If the value cannot remain equal to or greater than this value, matching will fail.
- `exact`
  - : A decimal number specifying a specific, required, value the property must have to be considered acceptable.
- `ideal`
  - : A decimal number specifying an ideal value for the property. If possible, this value will be used, but if it's not possible, the user agent will use the closest possible match.

### ConstrainDOMString

The `ConstrainDOMString` constraint type is used to specify a constraint for a property whose value is a string. Its value may either be set to a string, an array of strings, or an object containing the following properties:

- `exact`
  - : A {{domxref("DOMString")}}, or an array of `DOMString`s, one of which must be the value of the property. If the property can't be set to one of the listed values, matching will fail.
- `ideal`
  - : A {{domxref("DOMString")}}, or an array of `DOMString`s, specifying ideal values for the property. If possible, one of the listed values will be used, but if it's not possible, the user agent will use the closest possible match.

### ConstrainULong

The `ConstrainULong` constraint type is used to specify a constraint for a property whose value is an integer. Its value may either be set to a number or an object containing the following properties:

- `max`
  - : An integer specifying the largest permissible value of the property it describes. If the value cannot remain equal to or less than this value, matching will fail.
- `min`
  - : An integer specifying the smallest permissible value of the property it describes. If the value cannot remain equal to or greater than this value, matching will fail.
- `exact`
  - : An integer specifying a specific, required, value the property must have to be considered acceptable.
- `ideal`
  - : An integer specifying an ideal value for the property. If possible, this value will be used, but if it's not possible, the user agent will use the closest possible match.

## Properties

Some combination—but not necessarily all—of the following properties will exist on the object. This may be because a given browser doesn't support the property, or because it doesn't apply. For example, because {{Glossary("RTP")}} doesn't provide some of these values during negotiation of a WebRTC connection, a track associated with a {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}} will not include certain values, such as {{domxref("MediaTrackConstraints.facingMode", "facingMode")}} or {{domxref("MediaTrackConstraints.groupId", "groupId")}}.

Allowed values are `none` and `crop-and-scale`. `none` means that the user agent uses the resolution provided by the camera, its driver or the OS. `crop-and-scale` means that the user agent can use cropping and downscaling on the camera output  in order to satisfy other constraints that affect the resolution.

### Properties of shared screen tracks

These constraints apply to the `video` property of the object passed into {{domxref("MediaDevices.getDisplayMedia", "getDisplayMedia()")}} to obtain a stream for screen sharing.

- {{domxref("MediaTrackConstraints.cursor", "cursor")}}

  - : A [`ConstrainDOMString`](#constraindomstring) which specifies whether or not to include the mouse cursor in the generated track, and if so, whether or not to hide it while not moving. The value may be a single one of the following strings, or an array of them to allow the browser flexibility in deciding what to do about the cursor.

    - `always`
      - : The mouse is always visible in the video content of the {domxref("MediaStream"), unless the mouse has moved outside the area of the content.
    - `motion`
      - : The mouse cursor is always included in the video if it's moving, and for a short time after it stops moving.
    - `never`
      - : The mouse cursor is never included in the shared video.

- {{domxref("MediaTrackConstraints.displaySurface", "displaySurface")}}

  - : A [`ConstrainDOMString`](#constraindomstring) which specifies the types of display surface that may be selected by the user. This may be a single one of the following strings, or a list of them to allow multiple source surfaces:

    - `application`
      - : The stream contains all of the windows of the application chosen by the user rendered into the one video track.
    - `browser`
      - : The stream contains the contents of a single browser tab selected by the user.
    - `monitor`
      - : The stream's video track contains the entire contents of one or more of the user's screens.
    - `window`
      - : The stream contains a single window selected by the user for sharing.

- {{domxref("MediaTrackConstraints.logicalSurface", "logicalSurface")}}
  - : A [`ConstrainBoolean`](#constrainboolean) value which may contain a single Boolean value or a set of them, indicating whether or not to allow the user to choose source surfaces which do not directly correspond to display areas. These may include backing buffers for windows to allow capture of window contents that are hidden by other windows in front of them, or buffers containing larger documents that need to be scrolled through to see the entire contents in their windows.
