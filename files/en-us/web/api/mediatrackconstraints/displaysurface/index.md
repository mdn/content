{{APIRef("Media Capture and Streams")}}

The {{domxref("MediaTrackConstraints")}} dictionary's
**`displaySurface`** property is a
[`ConstrainDOMString`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackConstraints#ConstrainDOMString) describing the requested or mandatory constraints
placed upon the value of the {{domxref("MediaTrackSettings.displaySurface",
    "displaySurface")}} constrainable property.

This is used to specify the type or
types of display surfaces which {{domxref("MediaDevices.getDisplayMedia",
  "getDisplayMedia()")}} will let the user select among for sharing purposes.

If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported by checking
the value of {{domxref("MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.displaySurface")}} as returned by
a call to {{domxref("MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()")}}. However, typically this
is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any constraints they're unfamiliar with.

## Syntax

```js
var constraintsObject = { displaySurface: constraint };

constraintsObject.displaySurface = constraint;
```

### Value

A [`ConstrainDOMString`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaTrackConstraints#ConstrainDOMString) which specifies the type of display surface that's
being captured. This value _does not_ affect the list of display sources in the
browser's user interface.

See {{SectionOnPage("/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Streams_API/Constraints", "How
  constraints are defined")}} for an explanation of how to define constraints.

## Usage notes

You can check the setting selected by the user agent after the display media has been
created by {{domxref("MediaDevices.getDisplayMedia", "getDisplayMedia()")}} by calling
{{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.getSettings", "getSettings()")}} on the display media's
video {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}}, then checking the value of  the returned
{{domxref("MediaTrackSettings")}} object's
{{domxref("MediaTrackSettings.displaySurface", "displaySurface")}} object.

For example, if your app needs to know that the surface being shared is a monitor or
application—meaning that there's possibly a non-content backdrop—it can use code similar
to this:

```js
let mayHaveBackdropFlag = false;
let displaySurface = displayStream.getVideoTracks()[0].getSettings().displaySurface;

if (displaySurface === "monitor" || displaySurface ==="application") {
  mayHaveBackdropFlag = true;
}
```

Following this code, `mayHaveBackdrop`  is `true` if the display
surface contained in the stream is of type `monitor` or
`application`; either of these _may_ have non-content backdrop areas.
Later code can use this flag to determine whether or not to perform special processing,
such as to remove or replace the backdrop, or to "cut" the individual display areas out
of the received frames of video.

## Examples

Here are some example constraints objects for `getDisplayMedia()` that make
use of the `displaySurface` property. In addition, see
{{SectionOnPage("/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Streams_API/Constraints", "Example:
  Constraint exerciser")}} for a complete example showing how constraints are used.
