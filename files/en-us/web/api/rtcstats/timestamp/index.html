<p><span class="seoSummary">The <code><strong>timestamp</strong></code> property of the
    {{domxref("RTCStats")}} dictionary is a {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} object
    specifying the time at which the data in the object was sampled.</span> For reports
  related to RTCP packets, for instance, this indicates the time at which the data covered
  by the statistics was received at the corresponding endpoint.</p>

<p>The time is given in milliseconds elapsed since the UNIX epoch (the first moment of
  January 1, 1970, UTC).</p>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} value indicating the time at which the activity
  described by the statistics in this object was recorded, in milliseconds elapsed since
  the beginning of January 1, 1970, UTC. This should be accurate to within a few
  milliseconds but may not be entirely pricise, either because of hardware or operating
  system limitations or because of fingerprinting protection in the form of reduced clock
  precision or accuracy.</p>
