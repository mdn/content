{{APIRef}}

The `fullscreenchange` event is fired immediately after the browser switches into or out of fullscreen mode.

The event is sent to the `Element` that is transitioning into or out of fullscreen mode, and this event then bubbles up to the `Document`.

To find out whether the `Element` is entering or exiting fullscreen mode, check the value of {{domxref("Document.fullscreenElement")}}: if this value is `null` then the element is exiting fullscreen mode, otherwise it is entering fullscreen mode.

This event is not cancelable.

## Syntax

Use the event name in methods like {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}}, or set an event handler property.

```js
addEventListener("fullscreenchange", (event) => {});

onfullscreenchange = (event) => {};
```

## Event type

A generic {{domxref("Event")}}.

## Examples

### Logging `fullscreenchange` events

In this example, a handler for the `fullscreenchange` event is added to the {{domxref("Document")}}.

If the user clicks on the "Toggle Fullscreen Mode" button, the `click` handler will toggle fullscreen mode for the `div`. If `document.fullscreenElement` has a value it will exit fullscreen mode. If not, the div will be placed into fullscreen mode.

Remember that by the time the `fullscreenchange` event is handled, the status of the element has already changed. So if the change is to fullscreen mode, `document.fullscreenElement` will point to the element that is now in fullscreen mode. On the other hand, if `document.fullscreenElement` is null, fullscreen mode has been canceled.

What that means to the example code is that, if an element is currently in fullscreen mode, the `fullscreenchange` handler logs the `id` of the fullscreen element to the console. If `document.fullscreenElement` is null, the code logs a message that the change is to leave fullscreen mode.

#### HTML

```html
<h1>fullscreenchange event example</h1>
<div id="fullscreen-div">
  <button id="toggle-fullscreen">Toggle Fullscreen Mode</button>
  <pre id="logger"></pre>
</div>
```

#### CSS

```css
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

#fullscreen-div {
  height: 150px;
  padding: 1rem;
  background-color: pink;
}

#logger {
  height: 80px;
  padding: 0 0.5rem;
  background-color: white;
  overflow: scroll;
}
```

#### JavaScript

```js
const logger = document.querySelector("#logger");
const fullScreenElement = document.querySelector("#fullscreen-div");

function log(message) {
  logger.textContent = `${logger.textContent}\n${message}`;
}

function fullscreenchanged(event) {
  // document.fullscreenElement will point to the element that
  // is in fullscreen mode if there is one. If there isn't one,
  // the value of the property is null.
  if (document.fullscreenElement) {
    log(`Element: ${document.fullscreenElement.id} entered fullscreen mode.`);
  } else {
    log("Leaving fullscreen mode.");
  }
}

document.addEventListener("fullscreenchange", fullscreenchanged);

// When the toggle button is clicked, enter/exit fullscreen
document.getElementById("toggle-fullscreen").addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (document.fullscreenElement) {
    // exitFullscreen is only available on the Document object.
    document.exitFullscreen();
  } else {
    fullScreenElement.requestFullscreen();
  }
});
```
