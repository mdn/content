{{APIRef("DOM")}}

The **`Document.open()`** method opens a document for
{{domxref("Document.write", "writing", "", "1")}}.

This does come with some side effects. For example:

- All event listeners currently registered on the document, nodes inside the document,
  or the document's window are removed.
- All existing nodes are removed from the document.

## Syntax

```js
document.open();
```

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

A `Document` object instance.

## Examples

The following simple code opens the document and replaces its content with a number of
different HTML fragments, before closing it again.

```js
document.open();
document.write("<p>Hello world!</p>");
document.write("<p>I am a fish</p>");
document.write("<p>The number is 42</p>");
document.close();
```

## Notes

An automatic `document.open()` call happens when
{{domxref("document.write()")}} is called after the page has loaded.

### Gecko-specific notes

Starting with Gecko 1.9, this method is subject to the same same-origin policy as other
properties, and does not work if doing so would change the document's origin.

Starting with Gecko 1.9.2, `document.open()` uses the [principal](/docs/Security_check_basics) of the document whose URI it uses,
instead of fetching the principal off the stack. As a result, you can no longer call
{{domxref("document.write()")}} into an untrusted document from chrome, even using [`wrappedJSObject`](/en-US/docs/wrappedJSObject). See [Security check basics](/en-US/docs/Security_check_basics) for more about principals.

## Three-argument document.open()

There is a lesser-known and little-used three-argument version of
`document.open()` , which is an alias of {{domxref("Window.open()")}} (see
its page for full details).

This call, for example opens github.com in a new window, with its opener set to
`null`:

```js
document.open('https://www.github.com','', 'noopener=true')
```

## Two-argument document.open()

Browsers used to support a two-argument `document.open()`, with the
following signature:

```js
document.open(type, replace)
```

Where `type` specified the MIME type of the data you are writing (e.g.
`text/html`) and replace if set (i.e. a string of `"replace"`)
specified that the history entry for the new document would replace the current history
entry of the document being written to.

This form is now obsolete; it won't throw an error, but instead just forwards to
`document.open()` (i.e. is the equivalent of just running it with no
arguments).Â  The history-replacement behavior now always happens.
