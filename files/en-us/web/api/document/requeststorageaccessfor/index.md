{{APIRef("Storage Access API")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`requestStorageAccessFor()`** method of the {{domxref("Document")}} interface allows top-level sites to request third-party cookie access on behalf of embedded content originating from another site in the same [related website set](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API/Related_website_sets). It returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves if the access was granted, and rejects if access was denied.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
requestStorageAccessFor(requestedOrigin)
```

### Parameters

- `requestedOrigin`
  - : A string representing the URL of the origin you are requesting third-party cookie access for.

### Return value

A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that fulfills with `undefined` if the access to third-party cookies was granted and rejects if access was denied.

`requestStorageAccessFor()` requests are automatically denied unless the top-level content is currently processing a user gesture such as a tap or click ({{Glossary("transient activation")}}), or unless permission was already granted previously. If permission was not previously granted, they must run inside a user gesture-based event handler. The user gesture behavior depends on the state of the promise:

- If the promise resolves (i.e., permission was granted), then the user gesture has not been consumed, so the script can subsequently call APIs requiring a user gesture.
- If the promise is rejected (i.e., permission was not granted), then the user gesture has been consumed, so the script can't do anything that requires a gesture. This prevents scripts from calling `requestStorageAccessFor()` again if permission is denied.

### Exceptions

- `InvalidStateError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Thrown if the current {{domxref("Document")}} is not yet active.
- `NotAllowedError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Thrown if:
    - The document's window is not a [secure context](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts).
    - The document is not the top-level document.
    - The document has a `null` origin.
    - The supplied `requestedOrigin` is [opaque](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#concept-origin-opaque).
    - The top-level and embedded sites are not in the same [related website set](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API/Related_website_sets).
    - The embedding {{htmlelement("iframe")}} is sandboxed, and the `allow-storage-access-by-user-activation` token is not set.
    - Usage is blocked by a {{httpheader("Permissions-Policy/storage-access", "storage-access")}} [Permissions Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy).
    - Usage is denied by the user agent's permission request to use the API.
- `TypeError`
  - : Thrown if `requestedOrigin` is not a valid URL.

## Description

The `requestStorageAccessFor()` method addresses challenges in adopting the Storage Access API on top-level sites that use cross-site images or scripts requiring cookies. It is relevant to user agents that by default block access to [third-party](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Third-party_cookies), [unpartitioned](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API#unpartitioned_versus_partitioned_cookies) cookies to improve privacy (e.g. to prevent tracking), and is a proposed extension of the [Storage Access API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API).

`requestStorageAccessFor()` can enable third-party cookie access for cross-site resources directly embedded into a top-level site that are unable to request storage access themselves, for example {{htmlelement("img")}} elements. Cross-site content embedded in `<iframe>`s that has its own logic and resources and needs third-party cookie access should request storage access via {{domxref("Document.requestStorageAccess()")}}.

To check whether permission to access third-party cookies has already been granted via `requestStorageAccessFor()`, you can call {{domxref("Permissions.query()")}}, specifying the feature name `"top-level-storage-access"`. This is different from the feature name used for the regular {{domxref("Document.requestStorageAccess()")}} method, which is `"storage-access"`.

The `Permissions.query()` call must specify the embedded origin; for example:

```js
navigator.permissions.query({
  name: "top-level-storage-access",
  requestedOrigin: "https://www.example.com",
});
```

> **Note:** Usage of this feature may be blocked by a {{httpheader("Permissions-Policy/storage-access", "storage-access")}} [Permissions Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy) set on your server (the same one that controls the rest of the Storage Access API). In addition, the document must pass additional browser-specific checks such as allowlists, blocklists, on-device classification, user settings, or anti-[clickjacking](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Clickjacking) heuristics.

## Examples

```js
function rSAFor() {
  if ("requestStorageAccessFor" in document) {
    document.requestStorageAccessFor("https://example.com").then(
      (res) => {
        // Use storage access
        doThingsWithCookies();
      },
      (err) => {
        // Handle errors
      },
    );
  }
}
```

After a successful `requestStorageAccessFor()` call, cross-site requests will include cookies if they include [CORS](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) / [`crossorigin`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin), so sites may want to wait before triggering a request. Such requests must use the [`credentials: "include"`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch#credentials) option and resources must include the `crossorigin="use-credentials"` attribute.

For example:

```js
function checkCookie() {
  fetch("https://example.com/getcookies.json", {
    method: "GET",
    credentials: "include",
  })
    .then((response) => response.json())
    .then((json) => {
      // Do something
    });
}
```
