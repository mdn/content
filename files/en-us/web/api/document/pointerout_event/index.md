{{APIRef}}

The `pointerout` event is fired for several reasons including: pointing device is moved out of the _hit test_ boundaries of an element; firing the {{domxref("Document/pointerup_event", "pointerup")}} event for a device that does not support hover (see {{domxref("Document/pointerup_event", "pointerup")}}); after firing the {{domxref("Document/pointercancel_event", "pointercancel")}} event (see {{domxref("Document/pointercancel_event", "pointercancel")}}); when a pen stylus leaves the hover range detectable by the digitizer.

## Syntax

Use the event name in methods like {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}}, or set an event handler property.

```js
addEventListener('pointerout', (event) => {});

onpointerout = (event) => { };
```

## Event type

An {{domxref("PointerEvent")}}. Inherits from {{domxref("Event")}}.

## Event properties

_This interface inherits properties from {{domxref("MouseEvent")}} and {{domxref("Event")}}._

- {{ domxref('PointerEvent.pointerId')}} {{readonlyInline}}
  - : A unique identifier for the pointer causing the event.
- {{ domxref('PointerEvent.width')}} {{readonlyInline}}
  - : The width (magnitude on the X axis), in CSS pixels, of the contact geometry of the pointer.
- {{ domxref('PointerEvent.height')}} {{readonlyInline}}
  - : The height (magnitude on the Y axis), in CSS pixels, of the contact geometry of the pointer.
- {{ domxref('PointerEvent.pressure')}} {{readonlyInline}}
  - : The normalized pressure of the pointer input in the range `0` to `1`, where `0` and `1` represent the minimum and maximum pressure the hardware is capable of detecting, respectively.
- {{ domxref('PointerEvent.tangentialPressure')}} {{readonlyInline}}
  - : The normalized tangential pressure of the pointer input (also known as barrel pressure or [cylinder stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_stress)) in the range `-1` to `1`, where `0` is the neutral position of the control.
- {{ domxref('PointerEvent.tiltX')}} {{readonlyInline}}
  - : The plane angle (in degrees, in the range of `-90` to `90`) between the Y–Z plane and the plane containing both the pointer (e.g. pen stylus) axis and the Y axis.
- {{ domxref('PointerEvent.tiltY')}} {{readonlyInline}}
  - : The plane angle (in degrees, in the range of `-90` to `90`) between the X–Z plane and the plane containing both the pointer (e.g. pen stylus) axis and the X axis.
- {{ domxref('PointerEvent.twist')}} {{readonlyInline}}
  - : The clockwise rotation of the pointer (e.g. pen stylus) around its major axis in degrees, with a value in the range `0` to `359`.
- {{ domxref('PointerEvent.pointerType')}} {{readonlyInline}}
  - : Indicates the device type that caused the event (mouse, pen, touch, etc.)
- {{ domxref('PointerEvent.isPrimary')}} {{readonlyInline}}
  - : Indicates if the pointer represents the primary pointer of this pointer type.

## Examples

Using `addEventListener()`:

```js
document.addEventListener('pointerout', (event) => {
  console.log('Pointer moved out');
});
```

Using the `onpointerout` event handler property:

```js
document.onpointerout = (event) => {
  console.log('Pointer moved out');
};
```
