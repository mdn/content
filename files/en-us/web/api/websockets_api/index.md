{{DefaultAPISidebar("Websockets API")}}

The **WebSocket API** is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.

> **Note:** While a WebSocket connection is functionally somewhat similar to standard Unix-style sockets, they are not related.

## Interfaces

- [`WebSocket`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket)
  - : The primary interface for connecting to a WebSocket server and then sending and receiving data on the connection.
- [`CloseEvent`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CloseEvent)
  - : The event sent by the WebSocket object when the connection closes.
- [`MessageEvent`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessageEvent)
  - : The event sent by the WebSocket object when a message is received from the server.

## Tools

- [AsyncAPI](https://www.asyncapi.com/): A specification for describing event-driven architectures like WebSocket. You can use it to describe WebSocket-based APIs just as you would describe REST APIs with the OpenAPI specification. Learn [why you should consider using AsyncAPI with WebSocket](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/websocket-part1) and [how to do so](https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/websocket-part2).
- [HumbleNet](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/06/introducing-humblenet-a-cross-platform-networking-library-that-works-in-the-browser/): A cross-platform networking library that works in the browser. It consists of a C wrapper around WebSockets and WebRTC that abstracts away cross-browser differences, facilitating the creation of multi-user networking functionality for games and other apps.
- [µWebSockets](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets): Highly scalable WebSocket server and client implementation for [C++11](https://isocpp.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

- [CWS](https://github.com/ClusterWS/cWS): Fast C++ WebSocket implementation for Node.js (uWebSockets v0.14 fork)
- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io): A long polling/WebSocket based third party transfer protocol for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
- [SocketCluster](https://socketcluster.io/): A pub/sub WebSocket framework for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) with a focus on scalability.
- [WebSocket-Node](https://github.com/Worlize/WebSocket-Node): A WebSocket server API implementation for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
- [Total.js](https://www.totaljs.com): Web application framework for [Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org) (Example: [WebSocket chat](https://github.com/totaljs/examples/tree/master/websocket))
- [Faye](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faye-websocket): A {{DOMxRef("WebSocket")}} (two-ways connections) and [EventSource](/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) (one-way connections) for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) Server and Client.
- [SignalR](https://signalr.net/): SignalR will use WebSockets under the covers when it's available, and gracefully fallback to other techniques and technologies when it isn't, while your application code stays the same.
- [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/): A web server capable of proxying arbitrary commands (stdin/stdout) as a websocket.
- [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws): a popular WebSocket client & server library for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- [jsonrpc-bidirectional](https://github.com/bigstepinc/jsonrpc-bidirectional): Asynchronous RPC which, on a single connection, may have functions exported on the server and, and the same time, on the client (client may call server, server may also call client).
- [cowboy](https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy): Cowboy is a small, fast and modern HTTP server for Erlang/OTP with WebSocket support.
- [WebSocket King](https://websocketking.com): A client tool to help develop, test and work with WebSocket servers.
- [PHP WebSocket Server](https://github.com/napengam/phpWebSocketServer): Server written in PHP to handle connections via websocksets wss\:// or ws\://and normal sockets over ssl:// ,tcp\://
- [Channels](https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html): Django library that adds support for WebSockets (and other protocols that require long running asynchronous connections).
- [Flask-SocketIO](https://flask-socketio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): gives Flask applications access to low latency bi-directional communications between the clients and the server.
- [Gorilla WebSocket](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/gorilla/websocket): Gorilla WebSocket is a [Go](https://golang.org/) implementation of the WebSocket protocol.
