<p>{{APIRef("HTML DOM")}}</p>

<p><span class="seoSummary">The {{domxref("HTMLImageElement")}}
    property <code><strong>loading</strong></code> is a string whose value provides a hint
    to the {{Glossary("user agent")}} on how to handle the loading of the image which
    is currently outside the window's {{Glossary("visual viewport")}}.</span> This helps
  to optimize the loading of the document's contents by postponing loading the image until
  it's expected to be needed, rather than immediately during the initial page load.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush: js">let <em>imageLoadScheduling</em> = <em>htmlImageElement</em>.loading;
<em>htmlImageElement</em>.loading = <em>eagerOrLazy</em>;
</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A {{domxref("DOMString")}} providing a hint to the user agent as to how to best
  schedule the loading of the image to optimize page performance. The possible values are:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>eager</code></dt>
  <dd>The default behavior, <code>eager</code> tells the browser to load the image as soon
    as the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element is processed.</dd>
  <dt><code>lazy</code></dt>
  <dd>Tells the user agent to hold off on loading the image until the browser estimates
    that it will be needed imminently. For instance, if the user is scrolling through the
    document, a value of <code>lazy</code> will cause the image to only be loaded shortly
    before it will appear in the window's {{Glossary("visual viewport")}}.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<h3 id="Timing_of_the_load_event">Timing of the load event</h3>

<p>The {{domxref("Window.load_event", "load")}} event is fired when the document has been
  fully processed. When images are loaded eagerly (which is the default), every image in
  the document must be fetched before the <code>load</code> event can fire.</p>

<p>By specifying the value <code>lazy</code> for <code>loading</code>, you prevent the
  image from delaying the <code>load</code> attribute by the amount of time it takes to
  request, fetch, and process the image.</p>

<p>Images whose <code>loading</code> attribute is set to <code>lazy</code> but are located
  within the visual viewport immediately upon initial page load are loaded as soon as the
  layout is known, but their loads do not delay the firing of the <code>load</code> event.
  In other words, these images aren't loaded immediately when processing
  the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element, but are still loaded as part of the initial page
  load. They just don't affect the timing of the <code>load</code> event.</p>

<p>That means that when <code>load</code> fires, it's possible that any lazy-loaded images
  located in the visual viewport may not yet be visible.</p>

<h3 id="Preventing_element_shift_during_image_lazy_loads">Preventing element shift during
  image lazy loads</h3>

<p>When an image whose loading has been delayed by the <code>loading</code> attribute
  being set to <code>lazy</code> is finally loaded, the browser will determine the final
  size of the {{HTMLElement("img")}} element based on the style and intrinsic size of the
  image, then reflow the document as needed to update the positions of elements based on
  any size change made to the element to fit the image.</p>

<p>To prevent this reflow from occurring, you should explicitly specify the size of the
  image's presentation using the image element's {{htmlattrxref("width", "img")}} and
  {{htmlattrxref("height", "img")}} attributes. By establishing the intrinsic aspect ratio
  in this manner, you prevent elements from shifting around while the document loads,
  which can be disconcerting or offputting at best and can cause users to click the wrong
  thing at worst, depending on the exact timing of the deferred loads and reflows.</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>The <code>addImageToList()</code> function shown below adds a photo thumbnail to a list
  of items, using lazy-loading to avoid loading the image from the network until it's
  actually needed.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function addImageToList(url) {
  const list = document.querySelector("div.photo-list");

  let newItem = document.createElement("div");
  newItem.className = "photo-item";

  let newImg = document.createElement("img");
  newImg.loading = "lazy";
  newImg.width = 320;
  newImg.height = 240;
  newImg.src = url;

  newItem.appendChild(newImg);
  list.appendChild(newItem);
}
</pre>
