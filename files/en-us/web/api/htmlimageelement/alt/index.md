{{APIRef("HTML DOM")}}

The {{domxref("HTMLImageElement")}} property
**`alt`** provides fallback (alternate) text to display when
the image specified by the {{HTMLElement("img")}} element is not loaded.

This
may be the case because of an error, because the user has disabled the loading of
images, or because the image hasn't finished loading yet.

Perhaps the most important reason to use the `alt` tag is to support [accessibility](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility), as the `alt` text
may be used by screen readers and other assistive technologies to help differently-abled
users make full use of your content. It will be read aloud or sent to the touch device,
for example, to support visually impaired users.

> **Think of it like this:** When choosing `alt` strings for
> your images, imagine what you would say when reading the page to someone over the
> phone without mentioning that there's an image on the page.

The alternate text is displayed in the space the image would occupy and should be able
to take the place of the image _without altering the meaning of the page_.

## Syntax

```js
htmlImageElement.alt = altText;
let altText = htmlImageElement.alt;
```

### Value

A {{domxref("DOMString")}} which contains the alternate text to display when the image
is not loaded or for use by assistive devices.

The `alt` attribute is officially mandatory; it's meant to always be
specified. If the image doesn't require a fallback (such as for an image which is
decorative or an advisory icon of minimal importance), you may specify an empty string
(`""`). For compatibility reasons, browsers generally will accept an image
without an `alt` attribute, but you should try to get into the habit of using
it.

## Usage notes

The fundamental guideline for the `alt` attribute is that every image's
alternate text should be able to replace the image _without altering the meaning of
the page_. You should never use `alt` for text that could be construed
as a caption or title. There are separate attributes and elements designed for those
purposes.

## Examples

Beyond that, there are additional guidelines for using `alt` appropriately
which vary depending on what the image is being used for. These are shown in the
examples below.

### Decorative images

Images with no semantic meaning—such as those which are solely decorative—or of limited
informational value, should have their `alt` attributes set to the empty
string (`""`). This is shown in the example below.

#### HTML

In the HTML for this example, shown below, the {{HTMLElement("img")}} element includes
the `alt` property, which will prevent the image from having any alternate
text, since it's a decorative detail.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="left-margin">
    <img src="/files/16861/margin-flourish.svg" alt="">
  </div>
  <div class="contents">
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing
    elit. Quisque quis orci ligula. Lorem ipsum dolor sit
    amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. In ac neque libero.
    Vivamus consectetur rhoncus elit eget porta. Etiam
    pulvinar ex id sapien laoreet, quis aliquet odio
    lobortis. Nam ac mauris at risus laoreet cursus vitae et
    sapien. Etiam molestie auctor eros, ac porta risus
    scelerisque sit amet. Ut nunc neque, porta eu auctor at,
    tempor et arcu.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

#### CSS

The CSS for this example sets up the styles for the layout as shown in the result
below.

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

p {
  margin-block-start: 0;
  margin-block-end: 1em;
  margin-top: 0;
  margin-bottom: 1em;
}

.container {
  width: 100vh;
  height: 95vh;
  font: 16px Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;
}

.left-margin {
  background-color: rgb(241, 240, 237, 255);
  width: 9em;
  height: 100%;
  float: left;
  margin-right: 5px;
  padding-right: 1em;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

.left-margin img {
  width: 6em;
}

.contents {
  background-color: rgb(241, 240, 235, 255);
  height: 100%;
  margin-left: 2em;
  padding-top: 1em;
  padding-left: 2em;
  padding-right: 1em;
}
```

### Images used as buttons

When using an image as a button (by using it as the only visible child of an
{{HTMLElement("a")}} element representing a hyperlink), the `alt` attribute
must be used to convey the purpose of the button. In other words, it should be the same
text you would use in a textual button to serve the same purpose.

For example, in the snippet of HTML below, a toolbar which uses icon images as link
labels provides `alt` attributes for each giving a textual label to use
instead of the icon when the icons cannot be or are intentionally not used.

```html
<li class="toolbar" aria-role="toolbar">
  <a href="songs.html" aria-role="button"><img src="songicon.svg" alt="Songs"</a>
  <a href="albums.html" aria-role="button"><img src="albumicon.svg" alt="Albums"</a>
  <a href="artists.html" aria-role="button"><img src="artisticon.svg" alt="Artists"</a>
  <a href="playlists.html" aria-role="button"><img src="playlisticon.svg" alt="Playlists"</a>
</li>
```

### Images containing diagrams or maps

When an image contains information presented as a diagram, chart, graph, or map,
the `alt` text should provide the same information, at least in summary form.
This is true whether the /me image is in a bitmapped format such as [PNG](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#PNG_Portable_Network_Graphics) or [JPEG](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#JPEG_Joint_Photographic_Experts_Group_image) or in a vector format
like [SVG](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#SVG_Scalable_Vector_Graphics).

- For a map, the `alt` text could be directions to the place indicated by
  the map, similarly to how you would explain it verbally.
- For a chart, the text could describe the items in the chart and their values.
- For a diagram, the text could be an explanation of the concept presented by the
  diagram.

Keep in mind that any text included in diagrams and charts presented in
{{Glossary("SVG")}} format may be read by screen readers. This may impact the decisions
you make when writing the `alt` text for the diagram.

### Icons or logos

Logos (such as corporate or brand logos) and informational icons should use the
corresponding text in their `alt` strings. That is, if an image is a
corporate logo, the `alt` text should be the name of the company. If the
image is an icon representing a status or other information, the text should be the name
of that state.

For example, if an image is a badge that's shown on a page to indicate that the content
of the page is new and has been updated recently, the
corresponding `alt` text might be "`Updated Recently"` or even
"`Updated on 27 August 2019"`.

In this example, a starburst image with the word "New!" is used to indicate that an
article is about something new (and probably supposedly also exciting).
The `alt` attribute is set to `New Page!` to allow that text to be
displayed in place of the image if the image isn't available. It is also available to be
read by screen readers.

#### HTML

The HTML below creates a snippet of content from a site using the described icon. Note
the use of the `alt` attribute on the {{HTMLElement("img")}},
providing a good substitution string to use in case the image doesn't load.

```html
<div class="container">
  <img src="https://www.bitstampede.com/mdn-test/new-page.svg"
       alt="New Page!" class="pageinfo-badge">
  <p class="contents">
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing
    elit. Quisque quis orci ligula. Lorem ipsum dolor sit
    amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. In ac neque libero.
    Vivamus consectetur rhoncus elit eget porta. Etiam
    pulvinar ex id sapien laoreet, quis aliquet odio
    lobortis. Nam ac mauris at risus laoreet cursus vitae et
    sapien. Etiam molestie auctor eros, ac porta risus
    scelerisque sit amet. Ut nunc neque, porta eu auctor at,
    tempor et arcu.
  </p>
</div>
```

#### CSS

The main feature of the CSS here is the use of {{cssxref("clip-path")}} and
{{cssxref("shape-outside")}} to wrap the text around the icon in an appealing way.

```css
.container {
  max-width: 500px;
}

.pageinfo-badge {
  width: 9em;
  padding-right: 1em;
  float: left;
  clip-path: polygon(100% 0, 100% 50%, 90% 70%, 80% 80%,
             70% 90%, 50% 100%, 0 100%, 0 0);
  shape-outside: polygon(100% 0, 100% 50%, 90% 70%, 80% 80%,
             70% 90%, 50% 100%, 0 100%, 0 0);
}

.contents {
  margin-top: 1em;
  font: 16px Arial,Helvetica,Verdana,sans-serif;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Icons_or_logos", 640,400)}}

### Other images

Images showing objects or scenes should have `alt` text describing what's
seen in the image. A photo of a yellow teapot might literally have
its `alt` attribute set to "`A yellow teapot"`.
