{{DefaultAPISidebar("Remote Playback API")}}

The **`RemotePlayback`** interface of the {{domxref('Remote Playback API','','',' ')}} allows the page to detect availability of remote playback devices, then connect to and control playing on these devices.

## Properties

- {{domxref("RemotePlayback.state")}}{{ReadOnlyInline}}

  - : Represents the `RemotePlayback` connection's state. One of:

    - `"connecting"`
      - : The user agent is attempting to initiate remote playback with the selected device.
    - `"connected"`
      - : The transition from local to remote playback has happened, all commands will now take place on the remote device.
    - `"disconnected"`
      - : The remote playback has not been initiated, has failed to initiate, or has been stopped.

### Event handlers

- {{domxref("RemotePlayback.onconnecting")}}
  - : Fired when the user agent initiates remote playback.
- {{domxref("RemotePlayback.onconnect")}}
  - : Fired when the user agent successfully connects to the remote device.
- {{domxref("RemotePlayback.ondisconnect")}}
  - : Fired when the user agent disconnects from the remote device.

## Methods

- {{domxref("RemotePlayback.watchAvailability()")}}
  - : A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves with a `callbackId` of an available remote playback device.
- {{domxref("RemotePlayback.cancelWatchAvailability()")}}
  - : Cancels the request to monitor the availability of remote playback devices.
- {{domxref("RemotePlayback.prompt()")}}
  - : Prompts the user to select and give permission to connect to a remote playbabk device.

## Examples

The following example demonstrates a player with custom controls that support remote playback. Initially the button used to select a device is hidden:

```html
<video id="videoElement" src="https://example.org/media.ext">
<button id="deviceBtn" style="display: none;">Pick device</button>
```

The {{domxref("RemotePlayback.watchAvailability()")}} method is used to watch for available remote playback devices. If a device is available, use the callback to show the button.

```js
const deviceBtn = document.getElementById("deviceBtn");
const videoElem = document.getElementById("videoElement");

function availabilityCallback(available) {
  // Show or hide the device picker button depending on device availability.
  deviceBtn.style.display = available ? "inline" : "none";
}

videoElem.remote.watchAvailability(availabilityCallback).catch(() => {
  /* If the device cannot continuously watch available,
  show the button to allow the user to try to prompt for a connection.*/
  deviceBtn.style.display = "inline";
});
```
