The **`getBattery()`** method provides information about the system's battery.
It returns a battery promise, which resolves with a {{domxref("BatteryManager")}} object providing some properties to get the battery status also some events you can handle to monitor the battery status.
This implements the {{domxref("Battery Status API", "", "", "nocode")}}; see that documentation for additional details, a guide to using the API, and sample code.

Since Chrome 103, the `Navigator.getBattery()` method of {{domxref("Battery Status API", "", "", "nocode")}} only expose to secure context.

A {{JSxRef("Promise")}} that fulfills with a {{DOMxRef("BatteryManager")}} object which you can use to get information about the battery's state.

## Examples

This example fetches the current charging state of the battery and establishes a handler for the {{domxref("BatteryManager/chargingchange_event", "chargingchange")}} event, so that the charging state is recorded whenever it changes.

```js
let batteryIsCharging = false;

navigator.getBattery().then((battery) => {
  batteryIsCharging = battery.charging;

  battery.addEventListener("chargingchange", () => {
    batteryIsCharging = battery.charging;
  });
});
```
