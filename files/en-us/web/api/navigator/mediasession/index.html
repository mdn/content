<p>{{APIRef}}</p>

<p><span class="seoSummary">The read-only {{domxref("Navigator")}} property
    <code><strong>mediaSession</strong></code> returns a {{domxref("MediaSession")}}
    object that can be used to share with the browser metadata and other information about
    the current playback state of media being handled by a document.</span> This
  information may, in turn, be shared with the device and/or operating system in order to
  a device's standard media control user experience to describe and control the playback
  of the media.</p>

<p>In addition, the <code>MediaSession</code> interface provides the
  {{domxref("MediaSession.setActionHandler", "setActionHandler()")}} method, which lets
  you receive events when the user engages device controls such as either onscreen or
  physical play, pause, seek, and other similar controls. An internet radio app, for
  example, can use <code>setActionHandler()</code> to let fhe media controls on a keyboard
  or elsewhere on the user's device be used to control the app's media playback.</p>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A {{domxref("MediaSession")}} object the current document can use to share information
  about media it's playing and its current playback status. This information can include
  typical metadata such as the title, artist, and album name of the song being played as
  well as potentially one or more images containing things like album art, artist photos,
  and so forth.</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>In this example, metadata is submitted to the <code>mediaSession</code> object. Note
  that the code begins by ensuring that the {{domxref("navigator.mediaSession")}} property
  is available before attempting to use it.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">if ("mediaSession" in navigator){
  navigator.mediaSession.metadata = new MediaMetadata({
    title: "Podcast Episode Title",
    artist: "Podcast Host",
    album: "Podcast Name",
    artwork: [{src: "podcast.jpg"}]
  });
}
</pre>
