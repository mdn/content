{{APIRef("VirtualKeyboard")}}

The **`virtualKeyboard`** read-only property
of the {{domxref("navigator")}} interface returns a reference to the {{domxref("VirtualKeyboard_API", "VirtualKeyboard API")}}.

The VirtualKeyboard API provides developers control over the layout of their applications when the on-screen virtual keyboard appears and disappears on devices such as tablets, mobile phones, or other devices where a hardware keyboard may not be available.

## Value

A {{domxref("VirtualKeyboard")}} object you can use to opt-out of the automatic virtual keyboard behavior, show or hide the virtual keyboard programmatically, as well as get the current position and size of the virtual keyboard.
