{{APIRef("Web Workers API")}}{{Non-standard_header}}

The **`console`** read-only property of the {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope")}} interface returns a {{domxref("console")}} object providing access to the browser console for the worker.

## Syntax

```js
var consoleObj = self.console;
```

### Value

A {{domxref("console")}} object.

## Example

This property allows you to have access to a browser console for debugging purposes, inside a worker. So for example you could call

```js
console.log('test');
```

inside a worker (which would basically be the equivalent of `self.console.log('test');`, as these are being called on the worker scope, which can be referenced with {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope.self")}}), to return a test message out to the browser console.

If you are calling `console.log()` from a {{domxref("DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope")}} or other worker scope that acts on a single loaded window, that tab's web console will receive the logs. However,Â If you are calling `console.log()` from a {{domxref("SharedWorkerGlobalScope")}}, the global browser console will receive the logs.
