{{APIRef}}

The **`securitypolicyviolation`** event is fired when a [Content Security Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) is violated in a worker.

The handler can be assigned using the `onsecuritypolicyviolation` event handler property or using {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener()")}}.

## Syntax

Use the event name in methods like {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}}, or set an event handler property.

```js
addEventListener("securitypolicyviolation", (event) => {});

onsecuritypolicyviolation = (event) => {};
```

## Event type

A {{domxref("SecurityPolicyViolationEvent")}}. Inherits from {{domxref("Event")}}.

self.onsecuritypolicyviolation = (e) => {
  // Handle SecurityPolicyViolationEvent e here
};

  // Handle SecurityPolicyViolationEvent e here
});
