{{APIRef("Web Workers API")}}

The **`origin`** read-only property of the {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope")}} interface returns the origin of the global scope, serialized as a string.

## Value

A string.

## Examples

Executed from inside worker scope, the following snippet will log the worker's global scope's origin to the console each time it receives a message.

```js
self.onmessage = () => {
  console.log(self.origin);
};
```

If the origin is not a scheme/host/port tuple (say you are trying to run it locally, i.e. via `file://` URL), `origin` will return the string `"null"`.
