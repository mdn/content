{{APIRef("Web Workers API")}}

The **`importScripts()`** method of the {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope")}} interface synchronously imports one or more scripts into the worker's scope.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
importScripts(path0)
importScripts(path0, path1)
importScripts(path0, path1, /* … ,*/ pathN)
```

### Parameters

- `pathN`
  - : A string value representing the URL of the script to be imported. The URL may be absolute or relative. If the URL is relative, it is relative to the HTML document's base URL.

### Return value

None ({{jsxref("undefined")}}).

### Exceptions

- `NetworkError`
  - : Imported scripts were served without a `text/javascript` MIME type or without one of the permitted [legacy JavaScript MIME types](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types#legacy_javascript_mime_types).

## Examples

If you had some functionality written in a separate script called `foo.js` that you wanted to use inside worker.js, you could import it using the following line:

```js
importScripts("foo.js");
```

`importScripts()` and `self.importScripts()` are effectively equivalent — both represent `importScripts()` being called from inside the worker's inner scope.
