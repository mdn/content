{{ APIRef("Location") }}

The **`hash`** property of the {{domxref("Location")}} interface returns a string containing a `'#'` followed by the fragment identifier of the URL â€” the ID on the page that the URL is trying to target.

The fragment is not {{Glossary("Percent-encoding", "percent-encoded")}}. If the URL does not have a fragment identifier, this property contains an empty string, `""`.

## Value

A string.

## Examples

Assuming the user has navigated to `https://example.org#examples`, the following code will log `#examples`:

```js
const result = location.hash;
console.log(result);
```
