{{APIRef("Location")}}

The **`ancestorOrigins`** read-only
property of the {{domxref("Location")}} interface is a static
{{domxref("DOMStringList")}} containing, in reverse order, the origins of all ancestor
browsing contexts of the document associated with the given {{domxref("Location")}}
object.

You can use `location.ancestorOrigins` in the script for a document to
determine, for example, whenever the document is being framed by a site which you donâ€™t
expect it to be framed by. You can also use it to vary the behavior of the document
based on what site or list of sites is framing it.

## Syntax

```js
const ancestors = location.ancestorOrigins;
```
