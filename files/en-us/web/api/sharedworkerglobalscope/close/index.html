<p>{{APIRef("Web Workers API")}}</p>

<p>The <code><strong>close()</strong></code> method of the {{domxref("SharedWorkerGlobalScope")}} interface discards any tasks queued in the <code>SharedWorkerGlobalScope</code>'s event loop, effectively closing this particular scope.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush: js">self.close();</pre>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>If you want to close your worker instance from inside the worker itself, you can call the following:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">close();</pre>

<p><code>close()</code> and <code>self.close()</code> are effectively equivalent â€” both represent <code>close()</code> being called from inside the worker's inner scope.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: There is also a way to stop the worker from the main thread: the {{domxref("Worker.terminate")}} method.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>General note:</strong> In newer browser versions, <code>close()</code> is available on <code>SharedWorkerGlobalScope</code> and {{domxref("DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope.close", "DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope")}}. In older browser versions, it is available on {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope.close","WorkerGlobalScope")}}. This change was made to stop <code>close()</code> being available on service workers, as it isn't supposed to be used there and always throws an exception when called (see {{bug(1336043)}}).</p>
