{{APIRef("Web Workers API")}}

The **`close()`** method of the {{domxref("SharedWorkerGlobalScope")}} interface discards any tasks queued in the `SharedWorkerGlobalScope`'s event loop, effectively closing this particular scope.

## Syntax

```js
self.close();
```

## Example

If you want to close your worker instance from inside the worker itself, you can call the following:

```js
close();
```

`close()` and `self.close()` are effectively equivalent â€” both represent `close()` being called from inside the worker's inner scope.

> **Note:** There is also a way to stop the worker from the main thread: the {{domxref("Worker.terminate")}} method.
