{{APIRef("Web Workers API")}}

The **`name`** read-only property of the
{{domxref("SharedWorkerGlobalScope")}} interface returns the name that the
{{domxref("SharedWorker")}} was (optionally) given when it was created. This is the name
that theÂ {{domxref("SharedWorker.SharedWorker", "SharedWorker()")}} constructor can pass
to get a reference to the {{domxref("SharedWorkerGlobalScope")}}.

## Syntax

```js
var nameObj = self.name;
```

### Value

A {{domxref("DOMString")}}.

## Example

If a shared worker is created using a constructor with a `name` option:

```js
var myWorker = new SharedWorker("worker.js", { name : "mySharedWorker" });
```

the {{domxref("SharedWorkerGlobalScope")}} will now have a name of "mySharedWorker",
returnable by running

```js
self.name
```

from inside the shared worker.
