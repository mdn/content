**Long animation frames** (LoAFs) can impact the user experience of a website. They can cause slow user interface (UI) updates, resulting in seemingly unresponsive controls and [janky](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Jank) (or non-smooth) animated effects and scrolling, leading to user frustration. The [Long Animation Frames API](https://w3c.github.io/long-animation-frames/) allows developers to return information on long animation frames and better understand their root causes. This article shows how to use the Long Animation Frames API.

## What is a long animation frame?

Good responsiveness means that a page responds quickly to interactions made with it. That involves being able to paint any updates needed by the user in a timely manner, and avoiding blocking these updates from happening. Google's [Interaction to Next Paint (INP)](https://web.dev/articles/inp) metric, for example, recommends that a website should respond to page interactions (such as clicks or key presses) within 200ms.

For smooth animations, updates need to be faster still â€” for an animation to run at a smooth 60 frames per second, each animation frame should render within around 16ms (1000/60).

A LoAF is a rendering update that is delayed beyond 50ms.

## Observing long animation frames

To return information on LoAFs and pinpoint troublemakers, you can observe performance timeline entries with an {{domxref("PerformanceEntry.entryType", "entryType")}} of `"long-animation-frame"` using a standard {{domxref("PerformanceObserver")}}:

```js
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  console.log(list.getEntries());
});

observer.observe({ type: "long-animation-frame", buffered: true });
```

Previous long animation frames can also be queried, using a method such as {{domxref("Performance.getEntriesByType()")}}:

```js
const loafs = performance.getEntriesByType("long-animation-frame");
```

Be aware however that the maximum buffer size for `"long-animation-frame"` entry types is 200, after which new entries are dropped, so the `PerformanceObserver` approach is the recommended one.

## Examining "long-animation-frame" entries

Returned performance timeline entries with a type of `"long-animation-frame"` are represented by {{domxref("PerformanceLongAnimationFrameTiming")}} objects. This object has a {{domxref("PerformanceLongAnimationFrameTiming.scripts", "scripts")}} property containing an array of {{domxref("PerformanceScriptTiming")}} objects, each one of which contains information on a script that contrinbuted to the long animation frame.

The following is a JSON representation of a complete `"long-animation-frame"` performance entry example, containing a single script:

```json
{
  "blockingDuration": 0,
  "duration": 60,
  "entryType": "long-animation-frame",
  "firstUIEventTimestamp": 11801.099999999627,
  "name": "long-animation-frame",
  "renderStart": 11858.800000000745,
  "scripts": [
    {
      "duration": 45,
      "entryType": "script",
      "executionStart": 11803.199999999255,
      "forcedStyleAndLayoutDuration": 0,
      "invoker": "DOMWindow.onclick",
      "invokerType": "event-listener",
      "name": "script",
      "pauseDuration": 0,
      "sourceURL": "https://web.dev/js/index-ffde4443.js",
      "sourceFunctionName": "myClickHandler",
      "sourceCharPosition": 17796,
      "startTime": 11803.199999999255,
      "window": [Window object],
      "windowAttribution": "self"
    }
  ],
  "startTime": 11802.400000000373,
  "styleAndLayoutStart": 11858.800000000745
}
```

Beyond the standard data returned by a {{{domxref("PerformanceEntry")}}} entry, this contains the following noteworthy items:

- {{domxref("PerformanceLongAnimationFrameTiming.blockingDuration", "blockingDuration")}}
  - : A {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} indicating the total time the animation frame was being blocked.
- {{domxref("PerformanceLongAnimationFrameTiming.firstUIEventTimestamp", "firstUIEventTimestamp")}}
  - : A {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} indicating the time of the first UI event (for example mouse or keyboard) to be queued during the course of the current animation frame.
- {{domxref("PerformanceLongAnimationFrameTiming.renderStart", "renderStart")}}
  - : A {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} indicating the start time of the rendering cycle, which includes {{domxref("Window.requestAnimationFrame()")}} callbacks, style and layout calculation, {{domxref("ResizeObserver")}} callbacks, and {{domxref("IntersectionObserver")}} callbacks.
- {{domxref("PerformanceLongAnimationFrameTiming.styleAndLayoutStart", "styleAndLayoutStart")}}
  - : A {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} indicating the beginning of the time period spent in style and layout calculations for the current animation frame.
- {{domxref("PerformanceScriptTiming.executionStart", "script.executionStart")}}
  - : A {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} indicating the time script compilation finished and execution started.
- {{domxref("PerformanceScriptTiming.forcedStyleAndLayoutDuration", "script.forcedStyleAndLayoutDuration")}}
  - : A {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} indicating the total time spent by the script processing forced layout/style inside this script (see [Avoid layout thrashing](https://web.dev/articles/avoid-large-complex-layouts-and-layout-thrashing#avoid_layout_thrashing) for an idea of what causes this).
- {{domxref("PerformanceScriptTiming.invoker", "script.invoker")}} and {{domxref("PerformanceScriptTiming.invokerType", "script.invokerType")}}
  - : String values indicating how the script was called (for example `"IMG#id.onload"` or `"Window.requestAnimationFrame"`) and the script entry point type (for example `"event-listener"` or `"resolve-promise"`)
- {{domxref("PerformanceScriptTiming.pauseDuration", "script.pauseDuration")}}
  - : A {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} indicating the total time spent by the script in "pausing" synchronous operations (for example {{domxref("Window.alert()")}} calls, or synchronous {{domxref("XMLHttpRequest")}}s).
- {{domxref("PerformanceScriptTiming.sourceCharPosition", "script.sourceCharPosition")}}, {{domxref("PerformanceScriptTiming.sourceFunctionName", "script.sourceFunctionName")}}, and {{domxref("PerformanceScriptTiming.sourceURL", "script.sourceURL")}}
  - : Values representing the script character position, function name, and script URL, respectively. The source location referenced will be the script entry point, which won't necessarily be the precise location of the script feature that took up the most time. For example, if an event handler calls a library, which in turn calls a slow function, the event handler will be reported in the LoAF entry, not the library or the function.
- {{domxref("PerformanceScriptTiming.windowAttribution", "script.windowAttribution")}} an {{domxref("PerformanceScriptTiming.window", "script.window")}}
  - : An enumerated value describing the relationship of the container (i.e. top-level document or {{htmlelement("iframe")}}) this script was executed in to the top-level document, and a reference to its {{domxref("Window")}} object.

> **Note:** Script attribution is only provided for scripts running in the main thread of a page, including same-origin `<iframe>`s. Cross-origin `<iframe>`s, [web workers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API), [service workers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API), and [extension](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) code will not have script attribution in long animation frames, even if they impact the duration of one.

## Calculating timestamps

The timestamps provided in the {{domxref("PerformanceLongAnimationFrameTiming")}} class allow several further useful timings to be calculated for the the long animation frame:

| Timing                            | Calculation                                                              |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Start time                        | `startTime`                                                              |
| End time                          | `startTime + duration`                                                   |
| Work duration                     | `renderStart ? renderStart - startTime : duration`                       |
| Render duration                   | `renderStart ? (startTime + duration) - renderStart: 0`                  |
| Render: Pre-layout duration       | `styleAndLayoutStart ? styleAndLayoutStart - renderStart : 0`            |
| Render: Style and Layout duration | `styleAndLayoutStart ? (startTime + duration) - styleAndLayoutStart : 0` |

## Examples

### Long Animation Frames API feature detection

You can test whether the Long Animation Frames API is supported using {{domxref("PerformanceObserver.supportedEntryTypes")}}:

```js
if (PerformanceObserver.supportedEntryTypes.includes("long-animation-frame")) {
  // Monitor LoAFs
}
```

### Reporting LoAFs above a certain threshold

A useful strategy is to monitor all LoAFs and capture the ones above a certain threshold for further analysis (for example, send them back to an analytics endpoint):

```js
const REPORTING_THRESHOLD_MS = 150;

const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    if (entry.duration > REPORTING_THRESHOLD_MS) {
      // Example here logs to console; real code could send to analytics endpoint
      console.log(entry);
    }
  }
});

observer.observe({ type: "long-animation-frame", buffered: true });
```

Long animation frame entries can be quite large, therefore think carefully about what data from each entry should be sent to analytics. For example, the summary times of the entries and the script URLs might be enough for what you need.

### Observing the longest animation frames

You may wish to only collect data on the longest animation frames (say the top 5 or 10), to reduce the volume of data that needs to be collected. This could be handled as follows:

```js
MAX_LOAFS_TO_CONSIDER = 10;
let longestBlockingLoAFs = [];

const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  longestBlockingLoAFs = longestBlockingLoAFs
    .concat(list.getEntries())
    .sort((a, b) => b.blockingDuration - a.blockingDuration)
    .slice(0, MAX_LOAFS_TO_CONSIDER);
});
observer.observe({ type: "long-animation-frame", buffered: true });

// Report data on visibilitychange event
document.addEventListener("visibilitychange", () => {
  // Example here logs to console; real code could send to analytics endpoint
  console.log(longestBlockingLoAFs);
});
```

### Reporting long animation frames with interactions

Another useful technique is to send the largest LoAF entries where an interaction occurred during the frame, which can be detected by the presence of a {{domxref("PerformanceLongAnimationFrameTiming.firstUIEventTimestamp", "firstUIEventTimestamp")}} value.

The following code logs all LoAF entries greater than 150 ms where an interaction occurred during the frame. 150 is chosen because it is slightly less than the 200 millisecond Interaction to Next Paint (INP) threshold. You could choose a higher or lower value depending on your needs.

```js
const REPORTING_THRESHOLD_MS = 150;

const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  for (const entry of list.getEntries()) {
    if (
      entry.duration > REPORTING_THRESHOLD_MS &&
      entry.firstUIEventTimestamp > 0
    ) {
      // Example here logs to console; real code could send to analytics endpoint
      console.log(entry);
    }
  }
});

observer.observe({ type: "long-animation-frame", buffered: true });
```

### Identifying common script patterns in long animation frames

An alternative strategy is to look at which scripts appear most often in LoAF entries. Data could be reported back at a script and/or character position level to identify the most problematic scripts, for example in cases where themes or plugins causing performance issues are used across a number of sites.

The execution time of common scripts (or third-party origins) in LoAFs could be summed up and reported back to identify common contributors to LoAFs across a site or a collection of sites.

For example, to group scripts by URL:

```js
const observer = new PerformanceObserver(list => {
  const allScripts = list.getEntries().flatMap(entry => entry.scripts);
  const scriptSource = [...new Set(allScripts.map(script => script.sourceURL))];
  const scriptsBySource= scriptSource.map(sourceURL => ([sourceURL,
      allScripts.filter(script => script.sourceURL === sourceURL)
  ]));
  const processedScripts = scriptsBySource.map(([sourceURL, scripts]) => ({
    sourceURL,
    count: scripts.length,
    totalDuration: scripts.reduce((subtotal, script) => subtotal + script.duration, 0)
  }));
  processedScripts.sort((a, b) => b.totalDuration - a.totalDuration);
  / Example here logs to console; real code could send to analytics endpoint
  console.table(processedScripts);
});

observer.observe({type: 'long-animation-frame', buffered: true});
```

## Comparison with the Long Tasks API

The Long Animation Frames API was preceded by the [Long Tasks API](https://w3c.github.io/longtasks/) (see {{domxref("PerformanceLongTaskTiming")}}) â€” this has a similar purpose and usage, exposing information on [long tasks](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Long_task) that block the main thread for 50ms or more.

This is useful, as long tasks can cause responsiveness issues. For example, if a user clicks a button while the main thread is dealing with a long task, the UI response to the click will be delayed until the long task is completed. Conventional wisdom is to [break up long tasks into multiple smaller tasks](https://web.dev/articles/optimize-long-tasks) so that important interactions can be handled in between.

However, the Long Task API has its limitations:

- An animation frame could be composed of several tasks that fall below the 50ms threshold, yet still collectively block the main thread. The Long Animation Frames API gets around this by considering the animation frame as a whole.
- The {{domxref("PerformanceLongTaskTiming")}} entry type exposes more limited information than the {{domxref("PerformanceLongAnimationFrameTiming")}} type â€” it can tell you the container where a long task happened, but not the script or function that caused it, for example.
- The Long Tasks API provides an incomplete view, as it may exclude some important tasks. Some updates (rendering, for example) happen in separate tasks that ideally should be included together with the preceding execution that caused that update to accurately measure the "total work" for that interaction.

> **Note:** See [Where long tasks fall short](https://github.com/w3c/long-animation-frames#where-long-tasks-fall-short) for more information on long task limitations.
