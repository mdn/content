{{APIRef("Console API")}}

The **`console.assert()`** static method writes an error message to the console if the assertion is false. If the assertion is true, nothing happens.

{{AvailableInWorkers}}

## Syntax

```js-nolint
assert(assertion)

assert(assertion, obj1)
assert(assertion, obj1, obj2)
assert(assertion, obj1, obj2, /* …, */ objN)

assert(assertion, msg)
assert(assertion, msg, subst1)
assert(assertion, msg, subst1, /* …, */ substN)
```

### Parameters

- `assertion`
  - : Any boolean expression. If the assertion is false, a generic message indicating assertion failure is written to the console.
- `obj1` … `objN`
  - : A list of JavaScript objects to output. A representation of each of these objects is output to the console after a generic assertion failure message (which may be different from the message output when these objects are not present) in the order given with some type of separation between the message and between each of them. There is a special case if `obj1` is a string, which is described subsequently.
- `msg`
  - : A JavaScript string containing zero or more substitution strings, which are replaced with `subst1` through `substN` in consecutive order up to the number of substitution strings. A colon, a space, and then the substituted string are appended to the generic assertion message to form a detailed assertion message, and the result is output to the console.
- `subst1` … `substN`
  - : JavaScript objects with which to replace substitution strings within `msg`. This gives you additional control over the format of the output. See [Using string substitutions](/en-US/docs/Web/API/console#using_string_substitutions) for a description of how substitutions work. If there are more substutition objects than there are substitution strings, the extra objects are themselves written to the console after the detailed assertion message in the same manner as described for objects written after a generic assertion message.

### Return value

None ({{jsxref("undefined")}}).

## Examples

The following code example demonstrates the use of a JavaScript object following the assertion:

```js
const errorMsg = "the # is not even";
for (let number = 2; number <= 5; number++) {
  console.log(`the # is ${number}`);
  console.assert(number % 2 === 0, "%o", { number, errorMsg });
}
// output:
// the # is 2
// the # is 3
// Assertion failed: {number: 3, errorMsg: "the # is not even"}
// the # is 4
// the # is 5
// Assertion failed: {number: 5, errorMsg: "the # is not even"}
```
