<p class="summary"><span class="seoSummary">The read-only {{domxref("XRInputSource")}}
    property <code><strong>gripSpace</strong></code> returns an {{domxref("XRSpace")}}
    whose native origin tracks the pose used to render virtual objects so they appear to
    be held in (or part of) the user's hand.</span> For example, if a user were holding a
  virtual straight rod, the native origin of this <code>XRSpace</code> would be located at
  the approximate center of mass of the user's fist.</p>

<pre
  class="brush: js">var <var>xrSpace</var> = <em>xrInputSource</em>.gripSpace;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>An {{domxref("XRSpace")}} object representing the position and orientation of the input
  device in virtual space, suitable for rendering an image of the device into the scene.
  <code>gripSpace</code> is <code>null</code> if the input source is inherently
  untrackable. For example, only inputs whose {{domxref("XRInputSource.targetRayMode",
  "targetRayMode")}} is <code>tracked-pointer</code> provide a <code>gripSpace</code>.</p>

<p>Imagine that the controller is shaped like a straight rod, held in the user's fist. The
  native origin of the grip space is located at the centroid—the center of mass—of the
  user's fist, tracking the position of the user's hand.</p>

<p><strong>The coordinate system for the left hand's grip space.</strong></p>

<p><strong>The coordinate system for the right hand's grip space.</strong></p>

<p><img alt="A diagram showing how the grip space indicates the local coordinate system for the player's hand relative to the world." src="gripspace-righthand-light.svg"></p>


<p>As shown in the diagram above, the coordinate system is oriented as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The x-axis is perpendicular to the palm of the user's hand, with the direction
    extending outward from the back of the hand being +X if the controller is in the
    user's right hand or -X if the controller is in the left hand.</li>
  <li>The z-axis along the length of the rod, parallel to the user's palm and along the
    length of their grip. -Z is in the direction of the user's thumb, and +Z is in the
    opposite direction.</li>
  <li>The y-axis is implied by the relationship between the other two axes; as is always
    the case, it's the cross product of the other two axes (lying 90° away from both the X
    and Z axes).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>In tis example, taken from the frame rendering callback, the <code>gripSpace</code> is
  used to render a mesh that represents the position and orieintation of the controller in
  the virtual environment.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">for (let source in xrSession.inputSources) {
  if (source.gripSpace) {
    let gripPose = frame.getPose(source.gripSpace, xrRefSpace);

    if (gripPose) {
      myDrawMeshUsingTransform(controllerMesh, gripPose.transform.matrix);
    }
  }
}
</pre>

<p>For each input source which has a value for <code>gripSpace</code>, this loop obtains
  the {{domxref("XRPose")}} representing the position and orientation that are described
  by <code>gripSpace</code>. If a valid pose is returned, a method
  <code>myDrawMeshUsingTransform()</code> is called to  draw the controller's mesh
  transformed using the grip pose's transform matrix.</p>
