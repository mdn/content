{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}

The **`RTCDTMFSender`** interface provides a mechanism for transmitting {{Glossary("DTMF")}} codes on a [WebRTC](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}}. You gain access to the connection's `RTCDTMFSender` through the {{domxref("RTCRtpSender.dtmf")}} property on the audio track you wish to send DTMF with.

The primary purpose for WebRTC's DTMF support is to allow WebRTC-based communication clients to be connected to a {{interwiki("wikipedia", "public-switched telephone network")}} (PSTN) or other legacy telephone service, including extant voice over IP (VoIP) services. For that reason, DTMF can't be used between two WebRTC-based devices, because there is no mechanism provided by WebRTC for receiving DTMF codes.

## Properties

- {{domxref("RTCDTMFSender.toneBuffer")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : A {{domxref("DOMString")}} which contains the list of DTMF tones currently in the queue to be transmitted (tones which have already been played are no longer included in the string). See {{domxref("RTCDTMFSender.toneBuffer", "toneBuffer")}} for details on the format of the tone buffer.

## Methods

- {{domxref("RTCDTMFSender.insertDTMF()")}}
  - : Given a string describing a set of DTMF codes and, optionally, the duration of and inter-tone gap between the tones, `insertDTMF()` starts sending the specified tones. Calling `insertDTMF()` replaces any already-pending tones from the `toneBuffer`. You can abort sending queued tones by specifying an empty string (`""`) as the set of tones to play.

## Events

Listen to these events using {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}} or by assigning an event listener to the `oneventname` property of this interface.

- {{domxref("RTCDTMFSender.tonechange_event", "tonechange")}}
  - : The `tonechange` event is sent to the `RTCDTMFSender` instance's event handler to indicate that a tone has either started or stopped playing.
    Also available using the {{domxref("RTCDTMFSender.ontonechange", "ontonechange")}} event handler property.

## Example

See the article [Using DTMF with WebRTC](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Using_DTMF) for a full example.
