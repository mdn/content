<div>{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}</div>

<p><span class="seoSummary">The {{domxref("RTCRtpSender")}} method
    <code><strong>replaceTrack()</strong></code> replaces the track currently being used
    as the sender's source with a new {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}}.</span> The new
  track must be of the same media kind (audio, video, etc) and switching the track should
  not require negotiation.</p>

<p>Among the use cases for <code>replaceTrack()</code> is the common need to switch
  between the rear- and front-facing cameras on a phone. With <code>replaceTrack()</code>,
  you can have a track object for each camera and switch between the two as needed. See
  the example {{anch("Switching cameras")}} below.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js"><em>trackReplacedPromise</em> = <em>sender</em>.replaceTrack(<em>newTrack</em>);</pre>

<h3 id="Parameters">Parameters</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><code>newTrack</code> {{optional_inline}}</dt>
  <dd>A {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} specifying the track with which to replace the
    <code>RTCRtpSender</code>'s current source track. The new track's
    {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.kind", "kind")}} must be the same as the current track's,
    or the replace track request will fail.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Return_value">Return value</h3>

<p>A {{domxref("Promise")}} which is fulfilled once the track has been successfully
  replaced. The promise is rejected if the track cannot be replaced for any reason; this
  is commonly because the change would require renegotiation of the codec, which is not
  allowed (see {{anch("Things that require negotiation")}}).</p>

<p>If <code>newTrack</code> was omitted or was <code>null</code>,
  <code>replaceTrack()</code> stops the sender. No negotiation is required in this case.
</p>

<p>When the promise is fulfilled, the fulfillment handler receives a value of
  <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<h3 id="Exceptions">Exceptions</h3>

<p>If the returned promise is rejected, one of the following exceptions is provided to the
  rejection handler:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>InvalidModificationError</code></dt>
  <dd>Replacing the <code>RTCRtpSende<em>r</em></code>'s current track with the new one
    would require negotiation.</dd>
  <dt><code>InvalidStateError</code></dt>
  <dd>The track on which this method was called is stopped rather than running.</dd>
  <dt><code>TypeError</code></dt>
  <dd>The new track's <code>kind</code> doesn't match the original track.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Things_that_trigger_negotiation">Things that trigger negotiation</h3>

<p>Not all track replacements require renegotiation. In fact, even changes that seem huge
  can be done without requiring negotation. Here are the changes that can trigger
  negotiaton:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The new track has a resolution which is outside the bounds of the current track;
    that is, the new track is either wider or taller than the current one.</li>
  <li>The new track's frame rate is high enough to cause the codec's block rate to be
    exceeded.</li>
  <li>The new track is a video track and its raw or pre-encoded state differs from that of
    the original track.</li>
  <li>The new track is an audio track with a different number of channels fom the
    original.</li>
  <li>Media sources that have built-in encoders — such as hardware encoders — may not be
    able to provide the negotiated codec. Software sources may not implement the
    negotiated codec.</li>
</ul>
