<p><span class="seoSummary">The Payment Request API provides a consistent user experience for both merchants and users. It is not a new way for paying for things; rather, it's a way for users to select their preferred way of paying for things, and make that information available to a merchant.</span></p>

<h2 id="Payment_Request_concepts_and_usage">Payment Request concepts and usage</h2>

<p>Many problems related to online shopping-cart abandonment can be traced to checkout forms, which can be difficult and time consuming to fill out and often require multiple steps to complete. The <strong>Payment Request API</strong> is meant to reduce the number of steps needed to complete a payment online, potentially doing away with checkout forms. It aims to make the checkout process easier, by remembering a user's details, which are then passed along to a merchant hopefully without requiring a HTML form.</p>

<p>Advantages of using the Payment Request API with "basic-card" (card-based payments):</p>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Fast purchase experience</strong>: Users enter their details once into the browser and are then ready to pay for goods and services on the web. They no longer have to fill out the same details repeatedly across different sites.</li>
 <li><strong>Consistent experience on every site (that supports the API):</strong> As the payment sheet is controlled by the browser, it can tailor the experience to the user. This can include localizing the UI into the user's preferred language.</li>
 <li><strong>Accessibility</strong>: As the browser controls the input elements of the payment sheet, it can assure consistent keyboard and screen reader accessibility on every website without developers needing to do anything. A browser could also adjust the font size or color contrast of the payment sheet, making it more comfortable for the user to make a payment.</li>
 <li><strong>Credentials management</strong>: Users can manage their credit cards and shipping addresses directly in the browser. A browser can also sync these "credentials" across devices, making it easy for users to jump from desktop to mobile and back again when buying things.</li>
 <li><strong>Consistent error handling:</strong> The browser can check the validity of card numbers, and can tell the user if a card has expired (or is about to expire). The browser can automatically suggest which card to use based on past usage patterns or restrictions from the merchant (e.g, "we only accept Visa or Mastercard"), or allow the user to say which is their default/favorite card.</li>
</ul>

<p>To request a payment, a web page creates a {{domxref("PaymentRequest")}} object in response to a user action that initiates a payment, such as clicking a "Purchase" button. The <code>PaymentRequest</code> allows the web page to exchange information with the user agent while the user provides input to complete the transaction.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The API is available inside cross-origin {{htmlelement("iframe")}} elements only if they have had the {{htmlattrxref("allowpaymentrequest","iframe")}} attribute set on them.</p>
