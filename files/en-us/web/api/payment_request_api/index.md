The Payment Request API provides a consistent user experience for both merchants and users. It is not a new way for paying for things; rather, it's a way for users to select their preferred way of paying for things, and make that information available to a merchant.

## Payment Request concepts and usage

Many problems related to online shopping-cart abandonment can be traced to checkout forms, which can be difficult and time consuming to fill out and often require multiple steps to complete. The **Payment Request API** is meant to reduce the number of steps needed to complete a payment online, potentially doing away with checkout forms. It aims to make the checkout process easier, by having payment apps store a user's details, which are then passed along to a merchant, hopefully without requiring an HTML form.

To request a payment, a web page creates a {{domxref("PaymentRequest")}} object in response to a user action that initiates a payment, such as clicking a "Purchase" button. The `PaymentRequest` allows the web page to exchange information with the user agent while the user provides input to complete the transaction.

You can find a complete guide in [Using the Payment Request API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API/Using_the_Payment_Request_API).

> **Note:** The API is available inside cross-origin {{htmlelement("iframe")}} elements only if they have had the {{htmlattrxref("allowpaymentrequest","iframe")}} attribute set on them.

## Interfaces

- {{domxref('PaymentAddress')}}
  - : An object that contains address information; used for billing and shipping addresses, for example.
- {{domxref('PaymentRequest')}}
  - : An object that provides the API for creating and managing the {{Glossary("user agent", "user agent's")}} payment interface.
- {{domxref('PaymentRequestEvent')}}
  - : An event delivered to a payment handler when a {{domxref("PaymentRequest")}} is made.
- {{domxref('PaymentRequestUpdateEvent')}}
  - : Enables the web page to update the details of the payment request in response to a user action.
- {{domxref('PaymentMethodChangeEvent')}}
  - : Represents the user changing payment instrument (e.g., switching from one payment method to another).
- {{domxref('PaymentResponse')}}
  - : An object returned after the user selects a payment method and approves a payment request.
- {{domxref('MerchantValidationEvent')}}
  - : Represents the browser requiring the merchant (website) to validate themselves as allowed to use a particular payment handler (e.g., registered as allowed to use Apple Pay).

## Dictionaries

- {{domxref("AddressErrors")}}
  - : A dictionary containing strings providing descriptive explanations of any errors in any {{domxref("PaymentAddress")}} entries which have errors.
- {{domxref("PayerErrors")}}
  - : A dictionary containing strings providing descriptive explanations of any errors in related to {{domxref("PaymentResponse")}}'s email, phone, and name attributes.
- {{domxref("PaymentRequestUpdateEvent.updateWith#parameters", "PaymentDetailsUpdate")}}
  - : An object describing changes that need to be made to the payment details in the event that the server needs to update information following the instantiation of the payment interface but before the user begins to interact with it.
