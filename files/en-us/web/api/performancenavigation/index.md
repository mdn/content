{{APIRef("Performance API")}}{{Deprecated_Header}}

The legacy **`PerformanceNavigation`** interface represents information about how the navigation to the current document was done.

> **Warning:** This interface is deprecated in the [Navigation Timing Level 2 specification](https://w3c.github.io/navigation-timing/#obsolete).
> Please use the {{domxref("PerformanceNavigationTiming")}} interface instead.

An object of this type can be obtained by calling the {{domxref("Performance.navigation")}} read-only attribute.

## Instance properties

_The `PerformanceNavigation` interface doesn't inherit any properties._

- {{domxref("PerformanceNavigation.type")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}} {{deprecated_inline}}

  - : An `unsigned short` which indicates how the navigation to this page was done. Possible values are:

    - `TYPE_NAVIGATE` (0)
      - : The page was accessed by following a link, a bookmark, a form submission, or a script, or by typing the URL in the address bar.
    - `TYPE_RELOAD` (1)
      - : The page was accessed by clicking the Reload button or via the {{domxref("Location.reload()")}} method.
    - `TYPE_BACK_FORWARD` (2)
      - : The page was accessed by navigating into the history.
    - `TYPE_RESERVED` (255)
      - : Any other way.

- {{domxref("PerformanceNavigation.redirectCount")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}} {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : An `unsigned short` representing the number of REDIRECTs done before reaching the page.

## Instance methods

_The `Performance` interface doesn't inherit any methods._

- {{domxref("PerformanceNavigation.toJSON()")}} {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : A {{Glossary("Serialization","serializer")}} returning a JSON object representing the `PerformanceNavigation` object.

## Specifications

This feature is no longer on track to become a standard, as the [Navigation Timing specification](https://w3c.github.io/navigation-timing/#obsolete) has marked it as deprecated.
Use the {{domxref("PerformanceNavigationTiming")}} interface instead.
