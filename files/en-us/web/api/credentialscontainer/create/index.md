{{APIRef("Credential Management API")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`create()`** method of the
{{domxref("CredentialsContainer")}} interface returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}} that
resolves with a new {{domxref("Credential")}} instance based on the provided options, or
`null` if no `Credential` object can be created.

> **Note:** This method is restricted to top-level contexts. Calls to it within an
> `<iframe>` element will resolve without effect.

## Syntax

```js
var promise = CredentialsContainer.create([options])
```

### Parameters

- options

  - : An object of type {{domxref("CredentialCreationOptions")}} that contains options for
    the requested new `Credentials` object. It must include one of the options
    "password", "federated", or "publicKey". The options are:

    - `password`: {{optional_inline}} Either an
      {{domxref("HTMLFormElement")}}, or a {{domxref("PasswordCredentialData")}} object.
      TBD

      - `id`: (required) {{domxref("USVString")}} Inherited from
        {{domxref("CredentialData")}}.
      - `name`: {{optional_inline}} {{domxref("USVString")}} TBD
      - `iconURL`: {{optional_inline}} {{domxref("USVString")}} TBD
      - `password`: (required) {{domxref("USVString")}} TBD

    - `federated`: {{optional_inline}} An
      {{domxref("FederatedCredentialInit")}} object. Contains requirements for
      creating/obtaining federated credentials. The available options are:

      - `id`: (required) {{domxref("USVString")}} Inherited from
        {{domxref("CredentialData")}}.
      - `name`: {{optional_inline}} {{domxref("USVString")}} TBD
      - `iconURL`: {{optional_inline}} {{domxref("USVString")}} TBD
      - `provider`: (required) {{domxref("USVString")}} TBD
      - `protocol`: {{optional_inline}} {{domxref("USVString")}} TBD

    - `publicKey`: {{optional_inline}}
      an object that describes the options for creating a [WebAuthn](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API) credential containing the following properties:
      - `rp`: An object describing the relying party which requested the credential creation.
      - `user`: An object describing the user account for which the credential is generated.
      - `challenge`: A {{domxref("BufferSource")}}, emitted by the relying party's server and used as a [cryptographic challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Challenge%E2%80%93response_authentication). This value will be signed by the authenticator and the signature will be sent back as part of {{domxref("AuthenticatorAttestationResponse.attestationObject")}}.
      - `pubKeyCredParams`: An {{jsxref("Array")}} of element which specify the desired features of the credential, including its type and the algorithm used for the cryptographic signature operations. This array is sorted by descending order of preference.
      - `timeout` {{optional_inline}}: A numerical hint, in milliseconds, which indicates the time the caller is willing to wait for the creation operation to complete. This hint may be overridden by the browser.
      - `excludeCredentials` {{optional_inline}}: An {{jsxref("Array")}} of descriptors for existing credentials. This is provided by the relying party to avoid creating new public key credentials for an existing user who already have some.
      - `authenticatorSelection` {{optional_inline}}: An object whose properties are criteria used to filter out the potential authenticators for the creation operation.
      - `attestation` {{optional_inline}}: A {{jsxref("String")}} which indicates how the attestation (for the authenticator's origin) should be transported.
      - `extensions` {{optional_inline}}: An object with several client extensions' inputs. Those extensions are used to request additional processing (e.g. dealing with legacy FIDO APIs credentials, prompting a specific text on the authenticator, etc.).


### Returns

A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves with a {{domxref("Credential")}} instance, such
as {{domxref("PasswordCredential")}}, {{domxref("FederatedCredential")}},
or {{domxref("PublicKeyCredential")}}.
