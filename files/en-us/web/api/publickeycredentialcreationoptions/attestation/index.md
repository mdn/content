**`attestation`** is an optional property of the
{{domxref("PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions")}} dictionary. This is a string whose
value indicates the preference regarding the attestation transport, between the
authenticator, the client and the relying party.

The attestation is a mean for the relying party to verify the origin of the
authenticator with an attestation certificate authority. The information contained in
the attestation may thus disclose some information about the user (e.g. which device
they are using).

## Syntax

```js
attestation = publicKeyCredentialCreationOptions.attestation
```

### Value

A string which may be

- `"none"`: the relying party is not interested in this attestation. This
  avoids making a check with the attestation certificate authority and asking the user
  consent for sharing identifying information.
- `"indirect"`: the client may change the assertion from the authenticator
  (for instance, using an [anonymization CA](https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#anonymization-ca)). This
  value is used when the relying party wishes to verify the attestation.
- `"direct"`: the relying party wants to receive the attestation as
  generated by the authenticator.

The default value is `"none"`.

## Examples

```js
var publicKey = {
  attestation: "indirect",
  challenge: new Uint8Array(26) /* this actually is given from the server */,
  rp: {
    name: "Example CORP",
    id  : "login.example.com"
  },
  user: {
    id: new Uint8Array(26), /* To be changed for each user */
    name: "jdoe@example.com",
    displayName: "John Doe",
  },
  pubKeyCredParams: [
    {
      type: "public-key",
      alg: -7
    }
  ]
};

navigator.credentials.create({ publicKey })
  .then(function (newCredentialInfo) {
    // send attestation response and client extensions
    // to the server to proceed with the registration
    // of the credential
  }).catch(function (err) {
     console.error(err);
  });
```
