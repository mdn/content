{{APIRef("Navigation API")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`intercept()`** method of the
{{domxref("NavigateEvent")}} interface intercepts this navigation, turning it into a same-document navigation to the {{domxref("NavigationDestination.url", "destination")}} URL.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
intercept()
intercept(options)
```

### Parameters

- `options` {{optional_inline}}
  - : An options object containing the following properties:
    - `handler` {{optional_inline}}
      - : A callback function that defines what the navigation handling behavior should be; it returns a promise. This function will run after the {{domxref("Navigation.navigate_event", "navigate")}} event has fired and the {{domxref("Navigation.currentEntry", "currentEntry")}} property has been updated.
    - `precommitHandler` {{optional_inline}}
      - : A callback function that defines any behavior that should occur just before the navigation has finished; it accepts a controller object as an argument and returns a promise. This function will run after the {{domxref("Navigation.navigate_event", "navigate")}} event has fired but before the {{domxref("Navigation.currentEntry", "currentEntry")}} property has been updated.
    - `focusReset` {{optional_inline}}
      - : Defines the navigation's focus behavior. This may take one of the following values:
        - `after-transition`
          - : Once the promise returned by your handler function resolves, the browser will focus the first element with the [`autofocus`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/autofocus) attribute, or the {{htmlelement("body")}} element if no element has `autofocus` set. This is the default value.
        - `manual`
          - : Disable the default behavior.
    - `scroll` {{optional_inline}}
      - : Defines the navigation's scrolling behavior. This may take one of the following values:
        - `after-transition`
          - : Allow the browser to handle scrolling, for example by scrolling to the relevant fragment identifier if the URL contains a fragment, or restoring the scroll position to the same place as last time if the page is reloaded or a page in the history is revisited. This is the default value.
        - `manual`
          - : Disable the default behavior.

### Return value

None (`undefined`).

### Exceptions

- `InvalidStateError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Thrown if the current {{domxref("Document")}} is not yet active, or if the navigation has been cancelled.
- `SecurityError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Thrown if:
    - The event was dispatched by a {{domxref("EventTarget.dispatchEvent", "dispatchEvent()")}} call, rather than the user agent.
    - The navigation cannot be intercepted ({{domxref("NavigateEvent.canIntercept")}} is `false`).
    - A `precommitHandler()` callback was called on a non-cancelable event ({{domxref("Event.cancelable")}} is `false`).

## Description

The `intercept()` method is used to implement custom navigation behavior when a link is clicked in an application. It does this via a couple of different callbacks.

### Handling immediate navigations with `handler()`

The `handler()` callback is generally used to handle resource fetching and updating the UI to show the content for the new page, which will typically look like this, at a basic level:

```js
navigation.addEventListener("navigate", (event) => {
  const url = new URL(event.destination.url);

  if (url.pathname.startsWith("/articles/")) {
    event.intercept({
      async handler() {
        // Fetch the new content and display when ready
        const articleContent = await getArticleContent(url.pathname);
        renderArticlePage(articleContent);
      },
    });
  }

  // Include multiple conditions for different page types here, as needed
});
```

`handler()` will run after the {{domxref("Navigation.navigate_event", "navigate")}} event has fired and the {{domxref("Navigation.currentEntry", "currentEntry")}} property has been updated, meaning that it should be used to implemnent navigation behavior where the navigation is committed to. The new URL is shown in the browser, and history is updated, and the user should be shown something new.

### Handling precommit actions with `precommitHandler()`

However, depending on the URL, you might not always want to commit the navigation immediately. For example, if the user navigates to a restricted page and the user is not signed in, you may want to redirect the browser to a sign-in page. This kind of scenario can be dealt with using the `precommitHandler()` callback, which will run after the {{domxref("Navigation.navigate_event", "navigate")}} event has fired but before the {{domxref("Navigation.currentEntry", "currentEntry")}} property has been updated.

For example:

```js
navigation.addEventListener("navigate", (event) => {
  const url = new URL(event.destination.url);

  if (url.pathname.startsWith("/restricted/") && !userSignedIn) {
    event.intercept({
      async precommitHandler(controller) {
        controller.redirect("/signin/", {
          state: "signin-redirect",
          history: "push",
        });
      },
    });
  }
});
```

This pattern is simpler than the alternative of canceling the original navigation and starting a new one to the redirect location, because it avoids exposing the intermediate state. For example, only one `navigatesuccess` or `navigateerror` event fires, and if the navigation was triggered by a call to {{domxref("Navigation.navigate()")}}, the promise only fulfills once the redirect destination is reached.

The `precommitHandler()` callback takes a `controller` object as an argument, which contains a `redirect()` method. The `redirect()` method takes two parameters â€” a string representing the URL to redirect to, and an options object containing two parameters:

- `state` {{optional_inline}}
  - : Contains any state information you want to pass along with the navigation, for example for logging or tracking purposes.
- `history` {{optional_inline}}
  - : An enumerated value that specifies how this redirect should be added to the navigation history. It can take one of the following values:
    - `auto`
      - : The default value, which lets the browser decide how to handle it. Usually the value used is `push`, but it will become `replace` if the redirect points to the same URL as the pre-navigation URL.
    - `push`
      - : Adds a new {{domxref("NavigationHistoryEntry")}} to the navigation history, and clears any available forward navigation (that is, if the user previously navigated to other locations, then used the back button to return back through the history before then initiating the navigation that caused the redirect).
    - `replace`
      - : Replaces the {{domxref("Navigation.currentEntry")}} with the `NavigationHistoryEntry`.

`precommitHandler()` generally handles any modifications to the navigation behavior that are required before the navigation actually occurs as a result of the destination URL, cancelling or redirecting it somewhere else as required. Because `precommitHandler()` can be used to cancel navigations, they can only be run when the event's {{domxref("Event.cancelable")}} property is `true`. Calling `intercept()` with a `precommitHandler()` on a non-cancelable event results in a `SecurityError` being thrown.

### Responding to navigation success or failure

When the promises returned by the `intercept()` handler functions fulfill, the `Navigation` object's {{domxref("Navigation/navigatesuccess_event", "navigatesuccess")}} event fires, allowing you to run cleanup code after a successful navigation has completed. If they reject, meaning the navigation has failed, {{domxref("Navigation/navigateerror_event", "navigateerror")}} fires instead, allowing you to gracefully handle the failure case.

There is also a `finished` property on the return value of navigation methods (such as {{domxref("Navigation.navigate()")}}), which fulfills or rejects at the same time as the aforementioned events are fired, providing another path for handling the success and failure cases.

### Interaction between `precommitHandler()` and `handler()`

Both `precommitHandler()` and `handler()` callbacks can be included inside the same `intercept()` call.

- When the `precommitHandler()` promise fulfills, the browser moves on to run any `handler()` callback present. If `precommitHandler()` rejects, `navigateerror` fires, the `committed` and `finished` promises reject, and the navigation is cancelled.
- Once the `precommitHandler()` promise fulfills and the navigation is committed, and a new {{domxref("NavigationHistoryEntry")}} is created for the navigation, its `committed` promise fulfills.
- When the `handler()` promise fulfills and the `navigatesuccess` event fires, the navigation `finished` promise fulfills as well, to indicate the navigation is finished. If `handler()` rejects, `navigateerror` fires, the `finished` promise rejects, and the navigation is cancelled.

### Controlling focus behavior

By default, after a navigation handled using `intercept()` has occurred, the document focus will reset to the first element in the DOM with an [`autofocus`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/autofocus) attribute set, or the {{htmlelement("body")}} element, if no `autofocus` attribute is set. If you want to override this behavior, to manually implement a more accessible focus position on navigation (for example, the new top-level heading), you can do so by setting the `focusReset` option to `manual`.

```js
navigation.addEventListener("navigate", (event) => {
  const url = new URL(event.destination.url);

  if (url.pathname.startsWith("/articles/")) {
    event.intercept({
      focusReset: manual,
      async handler() {
        // Fetch the new content and display when ready
        const articleContent = await getArticleContent(url.pathname);
        renderArticlePage(articleContent);
        // Handle page focus with a custom function
        setPageFocus();
      },
    });
  }
});
```

### Controlling scroll behavior

After an `intercept()` navigation occurs, the following scrolling behavior occurs:

- For `push` and `replace` navigations (see {{domxref("Navigation.navigate()")}}), the browser will attempt to scroll to the fragment given by `event.destination.url`. If there is no fragment available, it will reset the scroll position to the top of the page.
- For {{domxref("Navigation.traverseTo", "traverse")}} and {{domxref("Navigation.reload", "reload")}} navigations, the browser behaves similarly to the previous bullet description, but delays its scroll restoration logic until the `intercept()` promise fulfills. It will perform no scroll restoration if the promise rejects. If the user has scrolled during the transition then no scroll restoration will be performed.

If you want to turn this behavior off, you can do so by setting the `scroll` option to `manual`.

```js
navigation.addEventListener("navigate", (event) => {
  const url = new URL(event.destination.url);

  if (url.pathname.startsWith("/articles/")) {
    event.intercept({
      scroll: manual,
      async handler() {
        // Fetch the new content and display when ready
        const articleContent = await getArticleContent(url.pathname);
        renderArticlePage(articleContent);
        // Handle scroll behavior with a custom function
        setScroll();
      },
    });
  }
});
```

If you want to manually trigger the default scrolling behavior described earlier (maybe you want to reset the scroll position to the top of the page early, before the full navigation has finished), you can do so by calling {{domxref("NavigateEvent.scroll()")}}.

## Examples

### Handling a navigation using `intercept()`

```js
navigation.addEventListener("navigate", (event) => {
  // Exit early if this navigation shouldn't be intercepted,
  // e.g. if the navigation is cross-origin, or a download request
  if (shouldNotIntercept(event)) return;

  const url = new URL(event.destination.url);

  if (url.pathname.startsWith("/articles/")) {
    event.intercept({
      async handler() {
        // The URL has already changed, so show a placeholder while
        // fetching the new content, such as a spinner or loading page
        renderArticlePagePlaceholder();

        // Fetch the new content and display when ready
        const articleContent = await getArticleContent(url.pathname);
        renderArticlePage(articleContent);
      },
    });
  }
});
```

### Using `focusReset` and `scroll`

Form submission can be detected by querying for the {{domxref("NavigateEvent.formData")}} property. The following example turns any form submission into one which stays on the current page. In this case, you don't update the DOM, so you can cancel any default reset and scroll behavior using `focusReset` and `scroll`.

```js
navigation.addEventListener("navigate", (event) => {
  if (event.formData && event.canIntercept) {
    // User submitted a POST form to a same-domain URL
    // (If canIntercept is false, the event is just informative:
    // you can't intercept this request, although you could
    // likely still call .preventDefault() to stop it completely).

    event.intercept({
      // Since we don't update the DOM in this navigation,
      // don't allow focus or scrolling to reset:
      focusReset: "manual",
      scroll: "manual",
      async handler() {
        await fetch(event.destination.url, {
          method: "POST",
          body: event.formData,
        });
        // You could navigate again with {history: 'replace'} to
        // change the URL here, which might indicate "done"
      },
    });
  }
});
```
