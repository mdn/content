{{APIRef("Web Speech API")}}

The **`localService`** read-only property of the
{{domxref("SpeechSynthesisVoice")}} interface returns a boolean value
indicating whether the voice is supplied by a local speech synthesizer service
(`true`), or a remote speech synthesizer service (`false`.)

This property is provided to allow differentiation in the case that some voice options
are provided by a remote service; it is possible that remote voices might have extra
latency, bandwidth or cost associated with them, so such distinction may be useful.

## Value

A boolean value.

## Examples

```js
for (const voice of voices) {
  const option = document.createElement("option");
  option.textContent = `${voice.name} (${voice.lang})`;

  if (voice.default) {
    option.textContent += " â€” DEFAULT";
  }

  console.log(voice.localService);

  option.setAttribute("data-lang", voice.lang);
  option.setAttribute("data-name", voice.name);
  voiceSelect.appendChild(option);
}
```
