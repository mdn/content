{{APIRef("Media Source Extensions")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`canConstructInDedicatedWorker`** static property of the {{domxref("MediaSource")}} interface returns `true` if `MediaSource` worker support is implemented, providing a low-latency feature detection mechanism.

If this were not available, the alternative would be a much higher latency approach such as attempting the creation of a `MediaSource` object from a dedicated worker and transferring the result back to the main thread.

## Value

A boolean. Returns `true` if `MediaSource` worker support is implemented, or `false` otherwise.

## Examples

```js
if (MediaSource.canConstructInDedicatedWorker) {
  // MSE is available in workers; let's do this
}
```
