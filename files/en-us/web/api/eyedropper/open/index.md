{{APIRef("EyeDropper API")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`EyeDropper.prototype.open()`** method starts the eyedropper mode, returning a promise which is fulfilled once the user has either selected a color or dismissed the eyedropper mode.

## Syntax

```js
eyeDropper.open();
eyeDropper.open({ signal: abortController.signal });
```

### Parameters

- `options` {{optional_inline}}

  - : An options object to pass an {{domxref("AbortSignal")}} signal:

    - `signal`
      - : An {{domxref("AbortSignal")}}. The eyedropper mode will be aborted when the `AbortSignal`'s {{domxref("AbortController/abort()", "abort()")}} method is called.

### Return value

A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that eventually resolves when the user selects a pixel color from the screen.

The promise resolves to an object with the following property:
- `sRGBHex`
  - : A string representing the selected color, in hexadecimal sRGB format (`#aabbcc`).

### Exceptions

Exceptions are not thrown but returned when the {{jsxref("Promise")}} is rejected.
The promise is rejected in two cases:

* When the user dismisses the eyedropper mode by pressing the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key.
* When the eyedropper mode is aborted by the {{domxref("AbortController")}} passed as an argument to `open()`.
