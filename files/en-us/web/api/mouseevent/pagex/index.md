{{APIRef("CSSOM View")}}

The **`pageX`** read-only property of
the {{domxref("MouseEvent")}} interface returns the XÂ (horizontal) coordinate (in
pixels) at which the mouse was clicked, relative to the left edge of the entire
document. This includes any portion of the document not currently visible.

Being based on the edge of the document as it is, this property takes into account any
horizontal scrolling of the page. For example, if the page is scrolled such that 200
pixels of the left side of the document are scrolled out of view, and the mouse is
clicked 100 pixels inward from the left edge of the view, the value returned by
`pageX` will be 300.

Originally, this property was defined as a `long` integer. The [CSSOM View Module](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSSOM_View) redefined it as a
`double` float. See the {{anch("Browser compatibility")}} section for
details.

See {{SectionOnPage("/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSSOM_View/Coordinate_systems", "Page")}} for
some additional information about coordinates specified in this fashion.

## Syntax

```js
var pageX = MouseEvent.pageX;
```

### Value

A floating-point number of pixels from the left edge of the _document_ at which
the mouse was clicked, regardless of any scrolling or viewport positioning that may be
in effect.

This property was originally specified in the Touch Events specification as a long
integer, but was redefined in the CSSOM View Module to be a double-precision
floating-point number to allow for subpixel precision. Even though numeric types both
are represented by `Number` in JavaScript, they may be handled differently
internally in the browser's code, resulting in potential behavior differences. See
{{anch("Browser compatibility")}} to learn which browsers have been updated to use the
revised data type.

## Example

### Showing the mouse position relative to page origin

Let's take a look at a simple example that shows you the mouse's position relative to
the page's origin. Since this example is presented in an {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}, that
top-left corner is the top-left corner of the frame, not the browser window.

#### HTML

```html
<div class="box">
  <p>
    Move the mouse around in this box to watch its coordinates change.
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>pageX</code>: <span id="x">n/a</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    <code>pageY</code>: <span id="y">n/a</span>
  </p>
</div>
```

The HTML is simple; the box we'll be watching for mouse events on is given the class
`"box"`. It has two `<span>` elements, one with the ID
`"x"` and one with the ID `"y"`. Those will be updated each time
an event occurs to contain the latest mouse coordinates relative to the page.

#### CSS

The CSS used for this example is shown below.

```css
.box {
  width: 400px;
  height: 250px;
  border: 2px solid darkblue;
  background-color: blue;
  color: white;
  font: 16px "Zilla", "Open Sans", "Helvetica", "Arial", sans-serif;
}
```

#### JavaScript

```js
var box = document.querySelector(".box");
var pageX = document.getElementById("x");
var pageY = document.getElementById("y");

function updateDisplay(event) {
  pageX.innerText = event.pageX;
  pageY.innerText = event.pageY;
}

box.addEventListener("mousemove", updateDisplay, false);
box.addEventListener("mouseenter", updateDisplay, false);
box.addEventListener("mouseleave", updateDisplay, false);
```

The JavaScript code uses {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener",
  "addEventListener()")}} to register the function `updateDisplay()` as the
event handler for the {{event("mousemove")}}, {{event("mouseenter")}}, and
{{event("mouseleave")}} events.

`updateDisplay()` replaces the contents of the {{HTMLElement("span")}}
elements meant to contain the X and Y coordinates with the values of `pageX`
and {{domxref("MouseEvent.pageY", "pageY")}}.

mouse position](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSSOM_View/Coordinate_systems#example) information in every available coordinate system.

## Specifications

{{Specifications}}

Prior to being added to the CSSOM View specification, `pageX` and
`pageY` were available on the {{domxref("UIEvent")}} interface in a limited
subset of browsers for a short time.
