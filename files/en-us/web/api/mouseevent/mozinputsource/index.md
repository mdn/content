The **`MouseEvent.mozInputSource`** read-only property on {{domxref("MouseEvent")}} provides information indicating the type of device that generated the event.
This lets you, for example, determine whether a mouse event was generated by an actual mouse or by a touch event (which might affect the degree of accuracy with which you interpret the coordinates associated with the event).
