{{APIRef("DOM Events")}}

The **`MouseEvent.buttons`** read-only
property indicates which buttons are pressed on the mouse (or other input device)
when a mouse event is triggered.

Each button that can be pressed is represented by a given number (see below). If more
than one button is pressed, the button values are added together to produce a new
number. For example, if the secondary (`2`) and auxilary (`4`)
buttons are pressed simultaneously, the value is `6` (i.e.,
`2 + 4`).

> **Note:** Do not confuse this property with the
> {{domxref("MouseEvent.button")}} property. The {{domxref("MouseEvent.buttons")}}
> property indicates the state of buttons pressed during any kind of mouse event,
> while the {{domxref("MouseEvent.button")}} property only guarantees the correct
> value for mouse events caused by pressing or releasing one or multiple buttons.

## Syntax

```js
var buttonsPressed = instanceOfMouseEvent.buttons
```

### Return value

A number representing one or more buttons. For more than one button pressed
simultaneously, the values are combined (e.g., `3` is primary + secondary).

- `0`: No button or un-initialized
- `1`: Primary button (usually the left button)
- `2`: Secondary button (usually the right button)
- `4`: Auxiliary button (usually the mouse wheel button or middle
  button)
- `8`: 4th button (typically the "Browser Back" button)
- `16` : 5th button (typically the "Browser Forward" button)

## Example

This example logs the `buttons` property when you trigger a
{{Event("mousedown")}} event.

### HTML

```html
<p>Click anywhere with one or more mouse buttons.</p>
<pre id="log">buttons: </pre>
```

### JavaScript

```js
let log = document.createTextNode('?');   // let log = new Text('?');

function logButtons(e) {
  log.data = `${e.buttons} (${e.type})`;  // log.nodeValue= `${e.buttons} (${e.type})`;
}

document.addEventListener('mouseup', logButtons);
document.addEventListener('mousedown', logButtons);
// document.addEventListener('mousemove', logButtons);

document.querySelector('#log').appendChild(log)
```

### Firefox notes

Firefox supports the `buttons` attribute on Windows, Linux (GTK), and macOS
with the following restrictions:

- Utilities allow customization of button actions. Therefore, _primary_ might
  not be the left button on the device, _secondary_ might not be the right
  button, and so on. Moreover, the middle (wheel) button, 4th button, and 5th button
  might not be assigned a value, even when they are pressed.
- Single-button devices may emulate additional buttons with combinations of button
  and keyboard presses.
- Touch devices may emulate buttons with configurable gestures (e.g., one-finger
  touch for _primary_, two-finger touch for _secondary_, etc.).
- On Linux (GTK), the 4th button and the 5th button are not supported. In addition,
  a {{Event("mouseup")}} event always includes the releasing button information in
  the `buttons` value.
- On Mac OS X 10.5, the `buttons` attribute always returns `0`
  because there is no platform API for implementing this feature.
