The **`getLayoutMap()`** method of the
{{domxref("Keyboard")}} interface returns a {{jsxref('Promise')}} that resolves with
an instance of {{domxref('KeyboardLayoutMap')}} which is a map-like object with
functions for retrieving the strings associated with specific physical keys.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
getLayoutMap()
```

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

A {{jsxref('Promise')}} that resolves with an instance of
{{domxref('KeyboardLayoutMap')}}.

## Examples

The following example demonstrates how to get the location- or layout-specific string
associated with the key that corresponds to the 'W' key on an English QWERTY keyboard.

```js
const keyboard = navigator.keyboard;
keyboard.getLayoutMap().then((keyboardLayoutMap) => {
  const upKey = keyboardLayoutMap.get("KeyW");
  window.alert(`Press ${upKey} to move up.`);
});
```
