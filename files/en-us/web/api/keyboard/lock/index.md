{{APIRef("Keyboard API")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}{{securecontext_header}}

The **`lock()`** method of the
{{domxref("Keyboard")}} interface returns a {{jsxref('Promise')}} after enabling the
capture of keypresses for any or all of the keys on the physical keyboard. This method
can only capture keys that are granted access by the underlying operating
system.

If `lock()` is called multiple times then only the key codes specified in the most recent call will be locked.
Any keys locked by a previous call to `lock()` are unlocked.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
lock()
lock(keyCodes)
```

### Parameters

- `keyCodes` {{optional_inline}}
  - : An {{jsxref('Array')}} of one or more key codes to lock. If no keycodes are provided
    all keys will be locked. A list of valid code values is found in the [UI Events KeyboardEvent code Values](https://w3c.github.io/uievents-code/#key-alphanumeric-writing-system) spec.

### Return value

A {{jsxref('Promise')}} that resolves with {{jsxref('undefined')}} when the lock was successful.

### Exceptions

- `AbortError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Thrown if a new call to `lock()` is made before the current one has finished.
- `InvalidAccessError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Thrown if any key in `keyCodes` is not a valid [key code attribute value](https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents-code/#key-code-attribute-value).
- `InvalidStateError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Thrown if `lock()` is not called in an active top-level browsing context.

## Security

[Transient user activation](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/User_activation) is required. The user has to interact with the page or a UI element in order for this feature to work.

## Examples

### Capturing all keys

The following example captures all keypresses.

```js
navigator.keyboard.lock();
```

### Capturing specific keys

The following example captures the "W", "A", "S", and "D" keys. It captures these keys
regardless of which modifiers are used with the key press. Assuming a standard US QWERTY
layout, registering `"KeyW"` ensures that "W", Shift+"W", Control+"W",
Control+Shift+"W", and all other key modifier combinations with "W" are sent to the app.
The same applies to for `"KeyA"`, `"KeyS"` and
`"KeyD"`.

```js
navigator.keyboard.lock(["KeyW", "KeyA", "KeyS", "KeyD"]);
```
