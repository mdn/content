{{APIRef("HTML DOM")}}{{deprecated_header}}

The **`chOff`** property of the {{domxref("HTMLTableRowElement")}} interface does nothing. It reflects the `charoff` attribute of the {{HTMLElement("tr")}} element.

> **Note:** This property was designed to participate to the ability to align table cell content on a specific character (typically the decimal point), but was never implemented by browsers.
>
> To achieve such alignment, watch for the support of a string value with the {{domxref("text-align")}} CSS property.
