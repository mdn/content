{{DefaultAPISidebar("WebVTT")}}

**Web Video Text Tracks Format** (**WebVTT**) is a format for displaying timed text tracks (such as subtitles or captions) using the {{HTMLElement("track")}} element. The primary purpose of WebVTT files is to add text overlays to a {{HTMLElement("video")}}. WebVTT is a text based format, which must be encoded using {{Glossary("UTF-8")}}. Where you can use spaces you can also use tabs. There is also a small API available to represent and manage these tracks and the data needed to perform the playback of the text at the correct times.

## WebVTT files

The MIME type of WebVTT is `text/vtt`.

A WebVTT file (`.vtt`) contains cues, which can be either a single line or multiple lines, as shown below:

```plain
WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
- Never drink liquid nitrogen.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
- It will perforate your stomach.
- You could die.
```

## WebVTT body

The structure of a WebVTT consists of the following components, some of them optional, in this order:

- An optional byte order mark (BOM).
- The string "`WEBVTT`".
- An optional text header to the right of `WEBVTT`.

  - There must be at least one space after `WEBVTT`.
  - You could use this to add a description to the file.
  - You may use anything in the text header except newlines or the string "`-->`".

- A blank line, which is equivalent to two consecutive newlines.
- Zero or more cues or comments.
- Zero or more blank lines.

##### Example 1 - Simplest possible WebVTT file

```plain
WEBVTT
```

##### Example 2 - Very simple WebVTT file with a text header

```plain
WEBVTT - This file has no cues.
```

##### Example 3 - Common WebVTT example with a header and cues

```plain
WEBVTT - This file has cues.

14
00:01:14.815 --> 00:01:18.114
- What?
- Where are we now?

15
00:01:18.171 --> 00:01:20.991
- This is big bat country.

16
00:01:21.058 --> 00:01:23.868
- [ Bats Screeching ]
- They won't get in your hair. They're after the bugs.
```

### Inner structure of a WebVTT file

Let's re-examine one of our previous examples, and look at the cue structure in a bit more detail.

```plain
WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.000
- Never drink liquid nitrogen.

00:05.000 --> 00:09.000
- It will perforate your stomach.
- You could die.
```

In the case of each cue:

- The first line is started with a time, which is the starting time for showing the text that appears underneath.
- On the same line, we then have a string of "`-->`".
- We finish the first line with a second time, which is the ending time for showing the associated text.
- We can then have one or more lines that start with a hyphen (-), each containing part of the text track to be shown.

We can also place comments in our `.vtt` file, to help us remember important information about the parts of our file. These should be on separate lines, starting with the string `NOTE`. You'll find more about these in the below section.

It is important to not use "extra" blank lines within a cue, for example between the timings line and the cue payload. WebVTT is line based; a blank line will close the cue.

## WebVTT comments

Comments are an optional component that can be used to add information to a WebVTT file. Comments are intended for those reading the file and are not seen by users. Comments may contain newlines but cannot contain a blank line, which is equivalent to two consecutive newlines. A blank line signifies the end of a comment.

A comment cannot contain the string "`-->`", the ampersand character (&), or the less-than sign (<). If you wish to use such characters, you need to escape them using for example `&amp;` for ampersand and `&lt;` for less-than. It is also recommended that you use the greater-than escape sequence (`&gt;`) instead of the greater-than character (`>`) to avoid confusion with tags.

A comment consists of three parts:

- The string `NOTE`.
- A space or a newline.
- Zero or more characters other than those noted above.

##### Example 4 - Common WebVTT example

```plain
NOTE This is a comment
```

##### Example 5 - Multi-line comment

```plain
NOTE
One comment that is spanning
more than one line.

NOTE You can also make a comment
across more than one line this way.
```

##### Example 6 - Common comment usage

```plain
WEBVTT - Translation of that film I like

NOTE
This translation was done by Kyle so that
some friends can watch it with their parents.

1
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
- Ta en kopp varmt te.
- Det är inte varmt.

2
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
- Har en kopp te.
- Det smakar som te.

NOTE This last line may not translate well.

3
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
- Ta en kopp
```

## Styling WebVTT cues

You can style WebVTT cues by looking for elements which match the {{cssxref("::cue")}} pseudo-element.

### Within site CSS

```css
video::cue {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, dimgray, lightgray);
  color: papayawhip;
}

video::cue(b) {
  color: peachpuff;
}
```

Here, all video elements are styled to use a gray linear gradient as their backgrounds, with a foreground color of `"papayawhip"`. In addition, text boldfaced using the {{HTMLElement("b")}} element are colored `"peachpuff"`.

The HTML snippet below actually handles displaying the media itself.

```html
<video controls autoplay src="video.webm">
 <track default src="track.vtt">
</video>
```

### Within the WebVTT file itself

You can also define the style directly in the WebVTT file. In this case, you insert your CSS rules into the file with each rule preceded by the string `"STYLE"` all by itelf on a line of text, as shown below:

```plain
WEBVTT

STYLE
::cue {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, dimgray, lightgray);
  color: papayawhip;
}
/* Style blocks cannot use blank lines nor "dash dash greater than" */

NOTE comment blocks can be used between style blocks.

STYLE
::cue(b) {
  color: peachpuff;
}

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
- Hello <b>world</b>.

NOTE style blocks cannot appear after the first cue.
```

We can also use identifiers inside WebVTT file, which can be used for defining a new style for some particular cues in the file. The example where we wanted the transcription text to be red highlighted and the other part to remain normal, we can define it as follows using CSS. Where it must be noted that the CSS uses escape sequences the way they are used in HTML pages:

```plain
WEBVTT

1
00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
That’s an, an, that’s an L!

crédit de transcription
00:04.000 --> 00:05.000
Transcrit par Célestes™
```

```css
::cue(#\31) { color: lime; }
::cue(#crédit\ de\ transcription) { color: red; }
```

Positioning of text tracks is also supported, by including positioning information after the timings in a cue, as seen below (see {{anch("Cue settings")}} for more information):

```plain
WEBVTT

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000 position:10%,line-left align:left size:35%
Where did he go?

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.500 position:90% align:right size:35%
I think he went down this lane.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.500 position:45%,line-right align:center size:35%
What are you waiting for?
```

## WebVTT cues

A cue is a single subtitle block that has a single start time, end time, and textual payload. Example 6 consists of the header, a blank line, and then five cues separated by blank lines. A cue consists of five components:

- An optional cue identifier followed by a newline.
- Cue timings.
- Optional cue settings with at least one space before the first and between each setting.
- A single newline.
- The cue payload text.

##### Example 7 - Example of a cue

```plain
1 - Title Crawl
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000 line:0 position:20% size:60% align:start
Some time ago in a place rather distant....
```

### Cue identifier

The identifier is a name that identifies the cue. It can be used to reference the cue from a script. It must not contain a newline and cannot contain the string "`-->"`. It must end with a single newline. They do not have to be unique, although it is common to number them (e.g., 1, 2, 3, ...).

##### Example 8 - Cue identifier from Example 7

```plain
1 - Title Crawl
```

##### Example 9 - Common usage of identifiers

```plain
WEBVTT

1
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.606
This is the first subtitle.

2
00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.074
This is the second.

3
00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.743
Third
```

### Cue timings

A cue timing indicates when the cue is shown. It has a start and end time which are represented by timestamps. The end time must be greater than the start time, and the start time must be greater than or equal to all previous start times. Cues may have overlapping timings.

If the WebVTT file is being used for chapters ({{HTMLElement("track")}} {{htmlattrxref("kind")}} is `chapters`) then the file cannot have overlapping timings.

Each cue timing contains five components:

- Timestamp for start time.
- At least one space.
- The string "`-->".`
- At least one space.
- Timestamp for end time.

  - Which must be greater than the start time.

The timestamps must be in one of two formats:

- `mm:ss.ttt`
- `hh:mm:ss.ttt`

Where the components are defined as follows:

- `hh` is hours.

  - Must be at least two digits.
  - Hours can be greater than two digits (e.g., 9999:00:00.000).

- `mm` is minutes.

  - Must be between 00 and 59 inclusive.

- `ss` is seconds.

  - Must be between 00 and 59 inclusive.

- `ttt` is milliseconds.

  - Must be between 000 and 999 inclusive.

##### Example 10 - Basic cue timing examples

```plain
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.606
00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:34.074
00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:35.743
00:00:35.827 --> 00:00:40.122
```

##### Example 11 - Overlapping cue timing examples

```plain
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
00:00:05.000 --> 00:01:00.000
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:50.000
```

##### Example 12 - Non-overlapping cue timing examples

```plain
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
00:00:10.000 --> 00:01:00.581
00:01:00.581 --> 00:02:00.100
00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.000
```

### Cue settings

Cue settings are optional components used to position where the cue payload text will be displayed over the video. This includes whether the text is displayed horizontally or vertically. There can be zero or more of them, and they can be used in any order so long as each setting is used no more than once.

The cue settings are added to the right of the cue timings. There must be one or more spaces between the cue timing and the first setting and between each setting. A setting's name and value are separated by a colon. The settings are case sensitive so use lower case as shown. There are five cue settings:

- **vertical**

  - Indicates that the text will be displayed vertically rather than horizontally, such as in some Asian languages.

        <th><code>vertical:lr</code></th>
        <td>writing direction is left to right</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

- **line**

  - Specifies where text appears vertically. If vertical is set, line specifies where text appears horizontally.
  - Value can be a line number.

    - The line height is the height of the first line of the cue as it appears on the video.
    - Positive numbers indicate top down.
    - Negative numbers indicate bottom up.

  - Or value can be a percentage.

    - Must be an integer (i.e., no decimals) between 0 and 100 inclusive.
    - Must be followed by a percent sign (%).

- **position**

  - Specifies where the text will appear horizontally. If vertical is set, position specifies where the text will appear vertically.
  - Value is a percentage.
  - Must be an integer (no decimals) between 0 and 100 inclusive.
  - Must be followed by a percent sign (%).

  - Value is a percentage.
  - Must be an integer (i.e., no decimals) between 0 and 100 inclusive.
  - Must be followed by a percent sign (%).

      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

- **align**

  - Specifies the alignment of the text. Text is aligned within the space given by the size cue setting if it is set.

        <td>bottom</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>

##### Example 13 - Cue setting examples

The first line demonstrates no settings. The second line might be used to overlay text on a sign or label. The third line might be used for a title. The last line might be used for an Asian language.

```plain
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000 line:63% position:72% align:start
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000 line:0 position:20% size:60% align:start
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000 vertical:rt line:-1 align:end
```

### Cue payload

The payload is where the main information or content is located. In normal usage the payload contains the subtitles to be displayed. The payload text may contain newlines but it cannot contain a blank line, which is equivalent to two consecutive newlines. A blank line signifies the end of a cue.

A cue text payload cannot contain the string "`-->"`, the ampersand character (&), or the less-than sign (<). Instead use the escape sequence "\&amp;" for ampersand and "\&lt;" for less-than. It is also recommended that you use the greater-than escape sequence "\&gt;" instead of the greater-than character (>) to avoid confusion with tags. If you are using the WebVTT file for metadata these restrictions do not apply.

In addition to the three escape sequences mentioned above, there are fours others. They are listed in the table below.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="3">Table 6 - Escape sequences</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
      <th>Character</th>
      <th>Escape Sequence</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Ampersand</td>
      <td>&#x26;</td>
      <td><code>&#x26;amp;</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Less-than</td>
      <td>&#x3C;</td>
      <td><code>&#x26;lt;</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Greater-than</td>
      <td>></td>
      <td><code>&#x26;gt;</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Left-to-right mark</td>
      <td></td>
      <td><code>&#x26;lrm;</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Right-to-left mark</td>
      <td></td>
      <td><code>&#x26;rlm;</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Non-breaking space</td>
      <td><code> </code></td>
      <td><code>&#x26;nbsp;</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Cue payload text tags

There are a number of tags, such as `<bold>`, that can be used. However, if the WebVTT file is used in a {{HTMLElement("track")}} element where the attribute {{htmlattrxref("kind")}} is `chapters` then you cannot use tags.

- **Timestamp tag**

  - The timestamp must be greater that the cue's start timestamp, greater than any previous timestamp in the cue payload, and less than the cue's end timestamp. The *active text* is the text between the timestamp and the next timestamp or to the end of the payload if there is not another timestamp in the payload. Any text before the *active text* in the payload is *previous text* . Any text beyond the *active text* is *future text* . This enables karaoke style captions.

  ##### Example 12 - Karaoke style text

  ```plain
  1
  00:16.500 --> 00:18.500
  When the moon <00:17.500>hits your eye

  1
  00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.500
  Like a <00:19.000>big-a <00:19.500>pizza <00:20.000>pie

  1
  00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.500
  That's <00:00:21.000>amore
  ```

The following tags are the HTML tags allowed in a cue and require opening and closing tags (e.g., `<b>text</b>`).

- **Class tag** (`<c></c>`)

  - Style the contained text using a CSS class.

  ##### Example 14 - Class tag

  ```html
  <c.classname>text</c>
  ```

- **Italics tag** (`<i></i>`)

  - Italicize the contained text.

  ##### Example 15 - Italics tag

  ```html
  <i>text</i>
  ```

- **Bold tag** (`<b></b>`)

  - Bold the contained text.

  ##### Example 16 - Bold tag

  ```html
  <b>text</b>
  ```

- **Underline tag** (`<u></u>`)

  - Underline the contained text.

  ##### Example 17 - Underline tag

  ```html
  <u>text</u>
  ```

- **Ruby tag** (`<ruby></ruby>`)

  - Used with ruby text tags to display [ruby characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_character) (i.e., small annotative characters above other characters).

  ##### Example 18 - Ruby tag

  ```html
  <ruby>WWW<rt>World Wide Web</rt>oui<rt>yes</rt></ruby>
  ```

- **Ruby text tag** (`<rt></rt>`)

  - Used with ruby tags to display [ruby characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_character) (i.e., small annotative characters above other characters).

  ##### Example 19 - Ruby text tag

  ```html
  <ruby>WWW<rt>World Wide Web</rt>oui<rt>yes</rt></ruby>
  ```

- **Voice tag** (`<v></v>`)

  - Similar to class tag, also used to style the contained text using CSS.

  ##### Example 20 - Voice tag

  ```html
  <v Bob>text</v>
  ```

## Methods and properties

The methods used in WebVTT are those which are used to alter the cue or region as the attributes for both interfaces are different. We can categorize them for better understanding relating to each interface in WebVTT:

- ### VTTCue

  - The methods which are available in this interface are:

    - GetCueAsHTML to get the HTML of that Cue.
    - VTT Constructor for creating new objects of Cues.
    - Autokeyword.
    - DirectionSetting: to set the direction of caption or text in a file.
    - LineAlignment: to adjust the line alignment.
    - PositionAlignSetting: to adjust the position of text.

- ### VTTRegion

  - The methods used for region are listed below along with description of their functionality:

    - ScrollSetting: For adjusting the scrolling setting of all nodes present in given region.
    - VTT Region Constructor: for construction of new VTT Regions.

## Tutorial on how to write a WebVTT file

There are few steps that can be followed to write a simple webVTT file. Before start, it must be noted that you can make use of a notepad and then save the file as ‘.vtt’ file. Steps are given below:

1.  Open a notepad.
2.  The first line of WebVTT is standardized similar to the way some other languages require you to put headers as the file starts to indicate the file type. On the very first line you have to write:

```plain
WEBVTT
```

3. Leave the second line blank, and on the third line the time for first cue is to be specified. For example, for a first cue starting at time 1 second and ending at 5 seconds, it is written as:

```plain
00:01.000 --> 00:05.000
```

1.  On the next line you can write the caption for this cue which will run from the first second to the fifth second, inclusive.
2.  Following the similar steps, a complete WebVTT file for specific video or audio file can be made.

## CSS pseudo-classes

CSS pseudo classes allow us to classify the type of object which we want to differentiate from other types of objects. It works in similar manner in WebVTT files as it works in HTML file.

It is one of the good features supported by WebVTT is the localization and use of class elements which can be used in same way they are used in HTML and CSS to classify the style for particular type of objects, but here these are used for styling and classifying the Cues as shown below:

In the above example it can be observed that we can use the identifier and pseudo class name for defining the language of caption, where `<i>` tag is for italics.

The type of pseudo class is determined by the selector it is using and working is similar in nature as it works in HTML. Following CSS pseudo classes can be used:

- Lang (Lanugage): e.g., p:lang(it).
- Link: e.g., a:link.
- Nth-last-child: e.g., p:nth-last-child(2).
- Nth-child(n): e.g., p:nth-child(2).

Where p and a are the tags which are used in HTML for paragraph and link, respectively and they can be replaced by identifiers which are used for Cues in WebVTT file.

### Notes

Prior to Firefox 50, the `AlignSetting` enum (representing possible values for {{domxref("VTTCue.align")}}) incorrectly included the value `"middle"` instead of `"center"`. This has been corrected.

WebVTT was implemented in Firefox 24 behind the preference {{pref("media.webvtt.enabled")}}, which is disabled by default; you can enable it by setting this preference to `true`. WebVTT is enabled by default starting in Firefox 31 and can be disabled by setting the preference to `false`.

Prior to Firefox 58, the `REGION` keyword was creating {{domxref("VTTRegion")}} objects, but they were not being used. Firefox 58 now fully supports `VTTRegion` and its use; however, this feature is disabled by default behind the preference `media.webvtt.regions.enabled`; set it to `true` to enable region support in Firefox 58. Regions are enabled by default starting in Firefox 59 (see bugs {{bug(1338030)}} and {{bug(1415805)}}).
