{{APIRef("Shared Storage API")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`clear()`** method of the {{domxref("SharedStorage")}} interface clears the current origin's shared storage, removing all data from it.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
clear()
```

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that fulfills with `undefined`.

### Exceptions

- The `Promise` rejects with a {{jsxref("TypeError")}} if:
  - The database was not cleared successfully due to shared storage not being available (for example it is disabled using a browser setting).
  - The calling site does not have the Shared Storage API included in a successful [privacy sandbox enrollment process](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Privacy_sandbox/Enrollment).
- In the case of {{domxref("WorkletSharedStorage")}}, the `Promise` rejects with a {{jsxref("TypeError")}} if the worklet module has not been added with {{domxref("Worklet.addModule", "SharedStorageWorklet.addModule()")}}.

> **Note:** In the case of {{domxref("WindowSharedStorage")}}, if the `clear()` operation doesn't successfully write to the database for a reason other than shared storage not being available, no error is thrown â€” the operation still fulfills with `undefined`.

## Examples

```js
window.sharedStorage.clear().then(console.log("Shared storage cleared"));
```
