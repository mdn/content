{{APIRef("Shared Storage API")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`set()`** method of the {{domxref("SharedStorage")}} interface either stores a new key-value pair in the current origin's shared storage or updates an existing one.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
set(key, value)
set(key, value, options)
```

### Parameters

- `key`
  - : A string representing the key in the key-value pair that you want to add or update.
- `value`
  - : A string representing the value you want to add or update.
- `options` {{optional_inline}}
  - : An options object containing the following properties:
    - `ignoreIfPresent`
      - : A boolean value. The value `true` causes the set operation to abort if a key-value pair with the specified `key` already exists. The default value `false` causes the set operation to overwrite the previous value.

### Return value

A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that fulfills with `undefined`.

### Exceptions

- The `Promise` rejects with a {{jsxref("TypeError")}} if:
  - The created entry was not successfully stored in the database due to shared storage not being available (for example it is disabled using a browser setting).
  - `key` and/or `value` exceed the browser-defined maximum length.
  - The calling site does not have the Shared Storage API included in a successful [privacy sandbox enrollment process](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Privacy_sandbox/Enrollment).
- In the case of {{domxref("WorkletSharedStorage")}}, the `Promise` rejects with a {{jsxref("TypeError")}} if the worklet module has not been added with {{domxref("Worklet.addModule", "SharedStorageWorklet.addModule()")}}.

> **Note:** In the case of {{domxref("WindowSharedStorage")}}, if the `set()` operation doesn't successfully write to the database for a reason other than shared storage not being available, no error is thrown â€” the operation still fulfills with `undefined`.

## Examples

```js
window.sharedStorage
  .set("ab-testing-group", "0", {
    ignoreIfPresent: true,
  })
  .then(console.log("Set operation completed"));
```
