{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}

The read-only property **`gatheringState`** property of the {{domxref("RTCIceTransport")}} interface returns a string that indicates the current gathering state of the ICE agent: `"new"`, `"gathering"`, or `"complete"`.

## Value

A string that indicates the current state of the ICE agent's candidate gathering process:

- `"new"`
  - : The {{domxref("RTCIceTransport")}} is newly created and has not yet started to gather ICE candidates.
- `"gathering"`
  - : The transport is in the process of gathering candidates.
- `"complete"`
  - : The transport has finished gathering ICE candidates and has sent the end-of-candidates indicator to the remote device. The transport won't gather any further candidates unless an [ICE restart](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Session_lifetime#ice_restart) occurs, at which point the gathering process starts over from scratch.
