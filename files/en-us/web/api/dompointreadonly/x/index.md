{{APIRef("DOM")}}

The **`DOMPointReadOnly`** interface's
**`x`** property holds the horizontal coordinate, x, for a
read-only point in space. This property cannot be changed by JavaScript code in this
read-only version of the `DOMPoint` object.

In general, positive values `x` mean to the right, and negative values of
`x` means to the left, assuming no transforms have resulted in a reversal.

## Syntax

```js
const xPos = someDOMPointReadOnly.x;
```

### Value

A double-precision floating-point value indicating the x coordinate's value for the
point. This value is **unrestricted**, meaning that it is allowed to be
infinite or invalid (that is, its value may be {{jsxref("NaN")}} or {{jsxref("Infinity",
  "Â±Infinity")}}).
