If the given attribute or property is not currently being animated, then it contains the same value as baseVal

> **Note:** The **animVal** property is a read only property. Internet ExplorerÂ 9 supports script-based SVG animation but it does not support declarative-based SVG animation. As a result, the **animVal** property contains the same value as the **baseVal** property.
