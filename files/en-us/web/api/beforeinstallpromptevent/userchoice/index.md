The **`userChoice`** property of the {{domxref("BeforeInstallPromptEvent")}} interface represents the installation choice that the user made, when they were prompted to install the app.

## Value

A {{jsxref("Promise")}} which resolves to an object containing two properties:

- `outcome` {{experimental_inline}} {{non-standard_inline}}

  - : A string indicating whether the user chose to install the app or not. It must be one of the following values:
    - `"accepted"`: The user installed the app.
    - `"dismissed"`: The user did not install the app.

- `platform` {{experimental_inline}} {{non-standard_inline}}
  - : If the user chose to install the app, this is a string naming the selected platform, which is one of the values from the {{domxref("BeforeInstallPromptEvent.platforms")}} property. If the user chose not to install the app, this is an empty string.
