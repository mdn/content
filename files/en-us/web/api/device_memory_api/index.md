The capabilities of a client device largely depend on the amount of available RAM. Traditionally, developers had to use heuristics and either benchmark a device or infer device capabilities based on other factors like the device manufacturer or User Agent strings.

## Determining device memory

There are two ways to determine the approximate amount of RAM a device has: use the Device Memory JavaScript API or accept Client Hints.

### JavaScript API

You may query the approximate amount of RAM a device has by retrieving {{DOMxRef("Navigator.deviceMemory")}}

```js
const RAM = navigator.deviceMemory;
```

### Client Hints

You may also use the [Client Hints](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client_hints) HTTP Header with the `Device-Memory` directive to retrieve the same approximate RAM capacity.
