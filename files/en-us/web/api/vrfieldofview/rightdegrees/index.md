The **`rightDegrees`** read-only property of the {{domxref("VRFieldOfView")}} interface returns the number of degrees to the right that the field of view extends in.

> [!NOTE]
> This property was part of the old [WebVR API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/). It has been superseded by the [WebXR Device API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/).

## Value

A double.

## Examples

See [`VRFieldOfView`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/VRFieldOfView#examples) for example code.

## Specifications

This property was part of the old [WebVR API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/) that has been superseded by the [WebXR Device API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/). It is no longer on track to becoming a standard.

Until all browsers have implemented the new [WebXR APIs](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Fundamentals), it is recommended to rely on frameworks, like [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/), [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/), or [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), or a [polyfill](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-polyfill), to develop WebXR applications that will work across all browsers. Read [Meta's Porting from WebVR to WebXR](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/documentation/web/port-vr-xr/) guide for more information.
