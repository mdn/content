{{APIRef("WebVR API")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}{{Deprecated_header}}

The **`leftDegrees`** read-only property of the {{domxref("VRFieldOfView")}} interface returns the number of degrees to the left that the field of view extends in.

> **Note:** This property was part of the old [WebVR API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/). It has been superseded by the [WebXR Device API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/).

## Syntax

```js
var myLeftDegrees = VRFieldOfView.leftDegrees;
```

### Value

A double.

## Examples

See [`VRFieldOfView`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/VRFieldOfView#examples) for example code.

## Specifications

This property was part of the old [WebVR API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/) that has been superseded by the [WebXR Device API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/). It is no longer on track to becoming a standard.

Until all browsers have implemented the new [WebXR APIs](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Fundamentals), it is recommended to rely on frameworks, like [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/), [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/), or [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), or a [polyfill](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-polyfill), to develop WebXR applications that will work across all browsers [\[1\]](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/oculus-browser/browser-vr-xr/).

## Browser compatibility
