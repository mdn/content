{{APIRef("Performance API")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`renderTime`** read-only property of the {{domxref("LargestContentfulPaint")}} interface represents the time that the element was rendered to the screen.

## Value

The `renderTime` property can have the following values:

- A {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp","timestamp")}} representing the time in milliseconds that the element was rendered to the screen.
- `0` if the resource is a cross-origin request and no {{HTTPHeader("Timing-Allow-Origin")}} HTTP response header is used.

## Examples

### Logging the renderTime of the largest contentful paint

This example uses a {{domxref("PerformanceObserver")}} notifying of new `largest-contentful-paint` performance entries as they are recorded in the browser's performance timeline. The `buffered` option is used to access entries from before the observer creation.

```js
const observer = new PerformanceObserver((list) => {
  const entries = list.getEntries();
  const lastEntry = entries[entries.length - 1]; // Use the latest LCP candidate
  console.log(lastEntry.renderTime);
});
observer.observe({ type: "largest-contentful-paint", buffered: true });
```

### Cross-origin image render time

For security reasons, the value of the {{domxref("LargestContentfulPaint.renderTime", "renderTime")}} property is `0` if the resource is a cross-origin request. Instead the {{domxref("LargestContentfulPaint.loadTime", "loadTime")}} is exposed. To expose cross-origin render time information, the {{HTTPHeader("Timing-Allow-Origin")}} HTTP response header needs to be set.

For example, to allow `https://developer.mozilla.org` to see `renderTime`, the cross-origin resource should send:

```http
Timing-Allow-Origin: https://developer.mozilla.org
```

Alternatively, you can use {{domxref("PerformanceEntry.startTime", "startTime")}} which returns the value of the entry's {{domxref("LargestContentfulPaint.renderTime", "renderTime")}} if it is not `0`, and otherwise the value of this entry's {{domxref("LargestContentfulPaint.loadTime", "loadTime")}}. However, it is recommended to set the {{HTTPHeader("Timing-Allow-Origin")}} header so that the metrics will be more accurate.

If you use `startTime`, you can flag any inaccuracies by checking if `renderTime` was used:

```js
const isAccurateLCP = entry.renderTime ? true : false;
```
