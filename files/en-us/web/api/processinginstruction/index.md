{{APIRef("DOM")}}

The **`ProcessingInstruction`** interface represents a [processing instruction](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-pi); that is, a {{domxref("Node")}} which embeds an instruction targeting a specific application but that can be ignored by any other applications which don't recognize the instruction.

> **Warning:** `ProcessingInstruction` nodes are only supported in XML documents, not in HTML documents. In these, a process instruction will be considered as a comment and be represented as a {{domxref("Comment")}} object in the tree.

A processing instruction may be different than the [XML declaration](/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction#xml_declaration).

> **Note:** User-defined processing instructions cannot begin with "`xml`", as `xml`-prefixed processing-instruction target names are reserved by the XML specification for particular, standard uses (see, for example, `<?xml-stylesheet ?>`.

For example:

```html
<?xml version="1.0"?>
```

is a processing instruction whose `target`is `xml`.
