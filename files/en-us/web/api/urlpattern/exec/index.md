{{APIRef("URL Pattern API")}} {{AvailableInWorkers}}

The **`exec()`** method of the {{domxref("URLPattern")}} interface takes a URL or object of URL parts, and returns either an object containing the results of matching the URL to the pattern, or `null` if the URL does not match the pattern.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
exec(input)
exec(url)
exec(url, baseURL)
```

### Parameters

- `input`
  - : An object providing the individual URL parts.
    The object members can be any of `protocol`, `username`, `password`, `hostname`, `port`, `pathname`, `search`, `hash`, or `baseURL`.
- `url`
  - : A string defining an absolute or relative URL.
    If a relative URL, then [`baseURL`](#baseurl) must also be provided and together they must resolve to an absolute URL.
    If the input cannot be parsed, or a relative URL without a base URL is provided, the method will return `false`.
- `baseURL` {{optional_inline}}
  - : A string representing the base URL to use in cases where [`url`](#url) is a relative URL.
    If not specified, it defaults to `undefined`.
    If provided but the base URL cannot be parsed, the method will return `false`.

URL parts that are not specified in the `url`/`input` may be [inherited from a base URL](#inheritance_from_a_baseurl) in some circumstances.
Omitted parts are treated as empty strings.

### Return value

An {{jsxref("object")}} that defines the matching elements and groups, or `null` if the passed inputs do not match the pattern.

The object has the following properties:

- `inputs`
  - : An array containing the inputs passed to the `exec()` function.
    This will either contain a passed `input` object, an an absolute `url` string, or a relative `url` and a `baseURL`.

- `protocol`, `username`, `password`, `hostname`, `port`, `pathname`, `search`, and `hash`
  - : Named properties for each URL-part.
    Each property contains an object with the following properties:
    - `input`
      - : The part of the input corresponding to the current URL-part property (which must have matched the pattern).
        This might be the empty string (`""`).
    - `groups`
      - : An object with properties for each match group in the URL part (if any), and the corresponding matched values in the inputs.
        The group properties are numbered from 0 for unnamed match groups (such as the wildcard).
        For named match groups, the property name is the group name.

### Exceptions

- {{jsxref("TypeError")}}
  - : Indicates that a `baseURL` is provided when an [`input`](#input) object is passed (it should only be passed with the `url` string).

## Description

The method is called on a {{domxref("URLPattern")}}, specifying an input url as a string with an optional base URL, or as object with properties for each URL-part.

The method returns an object containing the results of matching the URL to the pattern, or `null` if the URL does not match the pattern.
It also returns `null` if a relative `url` is passed but `baseURL` is not specified (an absolute test URL cannot be resolved).
Note that when passing an `input` object, `input.baseURL` is always optional.

### Inheritance from a BaseURL

URL-parts that are more specific than the least-specific part defined in the `url` can be inherited from `baseURL` (or from `input.baseURL` for `input`).
Intuitively this means that if the `pathname` part is specified in the input, the parts to its left in a URL may be inherited from the base URL (`protocol`, `hostname` and `port`), while the parts to its right may not (`search` and `hash`).
The `username` and `password` are never inherited from a base URL.

For more information see [Inheritance from a BaseURL](/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL_Pattern_API#inheritance_from_a_base_url) in the API overview.

## Examples

The examples shows how to use the `exec()` method to match a URL against a pattern.

### Matching an absolute URL

First we define the pattern to use for matching URLs.
This pattern matches against URLs that have either `http` or `https` protocol, are subdomains of `.example.com` and have a path that is `/books/` followed by any value.

```js
const pattern = new URLPattern("http{s}?://*.example.com/books/:id");
```

Next we test the URL string `"https://store.example.com/books/123"` against this pattern, and then separately log the objects for each property.
Note that the `input` shows the input in the URL that matches the pattern.
In many cases this is the empty string (`""`) because the input URL does not specify the particular URL part (this matches the pattern because by default it uses a wildcard match for unspecified URL parts).

```js
let match = pattern.exec("https://store.example.com/books/123");

console.log(match.inputs); // ['https://store.example.com/books/123']
console.log(match.protocol); // { input: "https", groups: {} }
console.log(match.username); // { input: "", groups: {"0": ""} }
console.log(match.password); // { input: "", groups: {"0": ""} }
console.log(match.hostname); // { input: "store.example.com", groups: { "0": "store" } }
console.log(match.port); // { input: "", groups: {} }
console.log(match.pathname); // { input: "/books/123", groups: { "id": "123" } }
console.log(match.search); // { input: "", groups: {"0": ""} }
console.log(match.hash); // { input: "", groups: {"0": ""} }
```

Note also how the `pathname` input `"/books/123"` matches to the pattern `/books/:id`, and `groups` includes a named property `id` that contains the matched value in the input.

### Matching a relative URL

This example uses the same pattern as before to match against a number of relative URLs and their corresponding base URLs.

```js
const pattern = new URLPattern("http{s}?://*.example.com/books/:id");
```

The code below matches effectively the same absolute URL as in the previous example, but split into a relative `url` string and a base URL.
The returned object differs only in the `inputs`:

```js
match = pattern.exec("/books/123", "http://store.example.com"); // returns object
console.log(match.inputs); // ['/books/123', 'https://store.example.com']
```

The two examples below both return `null`.
The first example doesn't match because the relative URL and base URL do not resolve to a valid absolute URL.
The second example doesn't match because no base URL is provided.

```js
pattern.exec("/books/123", "data:text/plain,hello world!"); // returns null
pattern.exec("/books/123"); // returns null
```

### Matching with a URL object

This example uses the same pattern as before to match against a number of URLs defined as structured objects.

```js
const pattern = new URLPattern("http{s}?://*.example.com/books/:id");
```

This code tests against the same URL that was used in the previous example [Matching an absolute URL](#matching_an_absolute_url).
In this case those though it is passed as a structured object.
Since it is the same URL the only thing that changes is that the `inputs` property array will contain the object passed below.

```js
pattern.exec({
  protocol: "https",
  hostname: "store.example.com",
  pathname: "/books/123",
}); // returns object
```

The following code also matches, but this time the `protocol` is `http`, inherited from the `baseURL`.
The object returned would be similar except for the `protocol.input`, which would be `http`, and the `inputs` array would match the passed object.

```js
pattern.exec({
  pathname: "/books/123",
  baseURL: "http://store.example.com",
}); // returns object
```

The following code doesn't match because the protocol `file` is not one of the options specified in the pattern (`http` or `https`).
This returns `null`.

```js
pattern.exec({
  protocol: "file",
  hostname: "store.example.com",
  pathname: "/books/123",
}); // returns null
```
