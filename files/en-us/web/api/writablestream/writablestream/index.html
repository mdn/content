<p class="summary">The <strong><code>WritableStream()</code></strong> constructor creates
  a new {{domxref("WritableStream")}} object instance.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js">var <em>writableStream</em> = new WritableStream(<em>underlyingSink</em>[, <em>queuingStrategy</em>]);</pre>

<h3 id="Parameters">Parameters</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>underlyingSink {{optional_inline}}</dt>
  <dd>An object containing methods and properties that define how the constructed stream
    instance will behave. <code>underlyingSink</code> can contain the following:
    <dl>
      <dt>start(controller) {{optional_inline}}</dt>
      <dd>This is a method, called immediately when the object is constructed. The
        contents of this method are defined by the developer, and should aim to get access
        to the underlying sink. If this process is to be done asynchronously, it can
        return a promise to signal success or failure. The <code>controller</code>
        parameter passed to this method is a
        {{domxref("WritableStreamDefaultController")}}. This can be used by the developer
        to control the stream during set up.</dd>
      <dt>write(chunk, controller) {{optional_inline}}</dt>
      <dd>This method, also defined by the developer, will be called when a new chunk of
        data (specified in the <code>chunk</code> parameter) is ready to be written to the
        underlying sink. It can return a promise to signal success or failure of the write
        operation. The <code>controller</code> parameter passed to this method is a
        {{domxref("WritableStreamDefaultController")}} that can be used by the developer
        to control the stream as more chunks are submitted for writing. This method will
        be called only after previous writes have succeeded, and never after the stream is
        closed or aborted (see below).</dd>
      <dt>close(controller) {{optional_inline}}</dt>
      <dd>This method, also defined by the developer, will be called if the app signals
        that it has finished writing chunks to the stream. The contents should do whatever
        is necessary to finalize writes to the underlying sink, and release access to it.
        If this process is asynchronous, it can return a promise to signal success or
        failure. This method will be called only after all queued-up writes have
        succeeded. The <code>controller</code> parameter passed to this method is a
        {{domxref("WritableStreamDefaultController")}}, which can be used to control the
        stream at the end of writing.</dd>
      <dt>abort(reason) {{optional_inline}}</dt>
      <dd>This method, also defined by the developer, will be called if the app signals
        that it wishes to abruptly close the stream and put it in an errored state. It can
        clean up any held resources, much like <code>close()</code>, but
        <code>abort()</code> will be called even if writes are queued up — those chunks
        will be thrown away. If this process is asynchronous, it can return a promise to
        signal success or failure. The <code>reason</code> parameter contains a
        {{domxref("DOMString")}} describing why the stream was aborted.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  <dt>queuingStrategy {{optional_inline}}</dt>
  <dd>An object that optionally defines a queuing strategy for the stream. This takes two
    parameters:
    <dl>
      <dt>highWaterMark</dt>
      <dd>A non-negative integer — this defines the total number of chunks that can be
        contained in the internal queue before backpressure is applied.</dd>
      <dt>size(chunk)</dt>
      <dd>A method containing a parameter <code>chunk</code> — this indicates the size to
        use for each chunk, in bytes.</dd>
    </dl>

    <div class="note">
      <p><strong>Note</strong>: You could define your own custom
        <code>queuingStrategy</code>, or use an instance of
        {{domxref("ByteLengthQueuingStrategy")}} or {{domxref("CountQueuingStrategy")}}
        for this object value. If no <code>queuingStrategy</code> is supplied, the default
        used is the same as a <code>CountQueuingStrategy</code> with a high water mark of
        1.</p>
    </div>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Return_value">Return value</h3>

<p>An instance of the {{domxref("WritableStream")}} object.</p>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>The following example illustrates several features of this interface.  It shows the
  creation of the <code>WritableStream</code> with a custom sink and an API-supplied
  queuing strategy. It then calls a function called <code>sendMessage()</code>, passing
  the newly created stream and a string. Inside this function it calls the stream's
  <code>getWriter()</code> method, which returns an instance of
  {{domxref("WritableStreamDefaultWriter")}}. A <code>forEach()</code> call is used to
  write each chunk of the string to the stream. Finally, <code>write()</code> and
  <code>close()</code> return promises that are processed to deal with success or failure
  of chunks and streams.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">const list = document.querySelector('ul');

function sendMessage(message, writableStream) {
  // defaultWriter is of type WritableStreamDefaultWriter
  const defaultWriter = writableStream.getWriter();
  const encoder = new TextEncoder();
  const encoded = encoder.encode(message, { stream: true });
  encoded.forEach((chunk) =&gt; {
    defaultWriter.ready
      .then(() =&gt; {
        return defaultWriter.write(chunk);
      })
      .then(() =&gt; {
        console.log("Chunk written to sink.");
      })
      .catch((err) =&gt; {
        console.log("Chunk error:", err);
      });
  });
  // Call ready again to ensure that all chunks are written
  //   before closing the writer.
  defaultWriter.ready
    .then(() =&gt; {
      defaultWriter.close();
    })
    .then(() =&gt; {
      console.log("All chunks written");
    })
    .catch((err) =&gt; {
      console.log("Stream error:", err);
    });
}

const decoder = new TextDecoder("utf-8");
const queuingStrategy = new CountQueuingStrategy({ highWaterMark: 1 });
let result = "";
const writableStream = new WritableStream({
  // Implement the sink
  write(chunk) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) =&gt; {
      var buffer = new ArrayBuffer(2);
      var view = new Uint16Array(buffer);
      view[0] = chunk;
      var decoded = decoder.decode(view, { stream: true });
      var listItem = document.createElement('li');
      listItem.textContent = "Chunk decoded: " + decoded;
      list.appendChild(listItem);
      result += decoded;
      resolve();
    });
  },
  close() {
    var listItem = document.createElement('li');
    listItem.textContent = "[MESSAGE RECEIVED] " + result;
    list.appendChild(listItem);
  },
  abort(err) {
    console.log("Sink error:", err);
  }
}, queuingStrategy);

sendMessage("Hello, world.", writableStream);</pre>

<h3 id="Backpressure">Backpressure</h3>

<p>Because of how backpressure is supported in the API, its implementation in code may be
  less than obvious. To see how backpressure is implemented look for three things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>highWaterMark</code> property, which is set when creating the counting
    strategy (line 35), sets the maximum amount of data that the
    <code>WritableStream</code> instance will handle in a single <code>write()</code>
    operation. In this example, it's the maximum amount of data that can be sent to
    <code>defaultWriter.write()</code> (line 11).</li>
  <li>The <code>defaultWriter.ready</code> property returns a promise that resolves when
    the sink (the first property of the <code>WritableStream</code> constructor) is done
    writing data. The data source can wither write more data (line 11) or call
    <code>close()</code> (line 24). Calling <code>close()</code> too early can prevent
    data from being written. This is why the example calls
    <code>defaultWriter.ready</code> twice (lines 9 and 22). </li>
  <li>The {{jsxref("Promise")}} returned by the sink's <code>write()</code> method (line
    40) tells the <code>WritableStream</code> and its writer when to resolve
    <code>defaultWriter.ready</code>.</li>
</ul>
