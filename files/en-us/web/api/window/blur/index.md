{{APIRef}}{{deprecated_header}}

The **`Window.blur()`** method does nothing.

> **Note:** Historically, this method was the programmatic equivalent of the user shifting focus away
> from the current window. This behavior was removed due to hostile sites abusing this functionality.
> In Firefox, you can enable the old behavior with the `dom.disable_window_flip` preference.
