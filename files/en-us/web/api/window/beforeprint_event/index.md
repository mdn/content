{{APIRef}}

The **`beforeprint`** event is fired when the associated document is about to be printed or previewed for printing.

The {{domxref("Window.afterprint_event", "afterprint")}} and `beforeprint` events allow pages to change their content before printing starts (perhaps to remove a banner, for example) and then revert those changes after printing has completed. In general, you should prefer the use of a [`@media print`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries#targeting_media_types) CSS at-rule, but it may be necessary to use these events in some cases.

## Syntax

Use the event name in methods like {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}}, or set an event handler property.

```js
addEventListener('beforeprint', (event) => { });
onbeforeprint = (event) => { };
```

## Event type

A generic {{domxref("Event")}}.

## Examples

Using `addEventListener()`:

```js
window.addEventListener('beforeprint', (event) => {
  console.log('Before print');
});
```

Using the `onbeforeprint` event handler property:

```js
window.onbeforeprint = (event) => {
  console.log('Before print');
};
```
