{{APIRef("File System API")}}{{SecureContext_Header}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`showOpenFilePicker()`** method of the
{{domxref("Window")}} interface shows a file picker that allows a user to select a file
or multiple files and returns a handle for the file(s).

## Syntax

```js-nolint
showOpenFilePicker()
```

### Parameters

- `options` {{Optional_Inline}}

  - : An object containing options, which are as follows:

    - `excludeAcceptAllOption` {{Optional_Inline}}
      - : A boolean value that defaults to
        `false`. By default the picker should include an option to not apply
        any file type filters (instigated with the type option below). Setting this option
        to `true` means that option is _not_ available.
    - `id` {{Optional_Inline}}
      - : By specifying an ID, the browser can remember different directories for different
        IDs. If the same ID is used for another picker, the picker opens in the same
        directory.
    - `multiple` {{Optional_Inline}}
      - : A boolean value that defaults to `false`. When
        set to `true` multiple files may be selected.
    - `startIn` {{Optional_Inline}}
      - : A `FileSystemHandle` or a well known directory (`"desktop"`, `"documents"`,
        `"downloads"`, `"music"`, `"pictures"`, or `"videos"`) to open the dialog in.
    - `types` {{Optional_Inline}}

      - : An {{jsxref('Array')}} of allowed file types to pick. Each
        item is an object with the following options:

        - `description` {{Optional_Inline}}
          - : An optional description of the category of files types allowed. Defaults to an empty string.
        - `accept`
          - : An {{jsxref('Object')}} with the keys set to the [MIME type](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types) and the values an {{jsxref('Array')}} of file extensions (see below
            for an example).

### Return value

A {{jsxref("Promise")}} whose fulfillment handler receives an {{jsxref('Array')}} of {{domxref('FileSystemFileHandle')}} objects.

### Exceptions

- `AbortError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Thrown if the user dismisses the prompt without making a selection, or
    if the user agent deems any selected files too sensitive or dangerous.
- `SecurityError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Thrown if the call was blocked by the [same-origin policy](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) or it was not called via a user interaction such as a button press.
- {{jsxref("TypeError")}}
  - : Thrown if accept types can't be processed, which may happen if:
    - Any key string of the `accept` options of any item in `types` options can't parse a valid MIME type.
    - Any value string(s) of the `accept` options of any item in `types` options is invalid, for example, if it does not start with `.` and if end with `.`, or if it contains any invalid code points and its length is more than 16.
    - The `types` options is empty and the `excludeAcceptAllOption` options is `true`.

## Security

[Transient user activation](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/User_activation) is required. The user has to interact with the page or a UI element in order for this feature to work.

## Examples

Here we set the options object for passing into the method. We'll allow a selection of
image file types, with no option to allow for all files types, or multiple file
selection.

```js
const pickerOpts = {
  types: [
    {
      description: "Images",
      accept: {
        "image/*": [".png", ".gif", ".jpeg", ".jpg"],
      },
    },
  ],
  excludeAcceptAllOption: true,
  multiple: false,
};
```

Next we can create an asynchronous function which show the file picker and return the
selected file.

```js
// create a reference for our file handle
let fileHandle;

async function getFile() {
  // open file picker, destructure the one element returned array
  [fileHandle] = await window.showOpenFilePicker(pickerOpts);

  // run code with our fileHandle
}
```
