{{APIRef("Web Storage API")}}

The **`localStorage`** read-only property of the {{domxref("window")}} interface allows you to access a {{DOMxRef("Storage")}} object for the {{DOMxRef("Document")}}'s {{glossary("origin")}}; the stored data is saved across browser sessions.

`localStorage` is similar to {{DOMxRef("Window.sessionStorage", "sessionStorage")}}, except that while `localStorage` data has no expiration time, `sessionStorage` data gets cleared when the page session ends â€” that is, when the page is closed. (`localStorage` data for a document loaded in a "private browsing" or "incognito" session is cleared when the last "private" tab is closed.)

## Value

A {{DOMxRef("Storage")}} object which can be used to access the current origin's local storage space.

### Exceptions

- `SecurityError`

  - : Thrown in one of the following cases:

    - The origin is not [a valid scheme/host/port tuple](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy#definition_of_an_origin). This can happen if the origin uses the `file:` or `data:` schemes, for example.
    - The request violates a policy decision. For example, the user has configured the browsers to prevent the page from persisting data.

    Note that if the user blocks cookies, browsers will probably interpret this as an instruction to prevent the page from persisting data.

## Description

The keys and the values stored with `localStorage` are _always_ in the UTF-16 string format, which uses two bytes per character. As with objects, integer keys are automatically converted to strings.

`localStorage` data **is specific to the protocol of the document**. In particular, for a site loaded over HTTP (e.g., `http://example.com`), `localStorage` returns a different object than `localStorage` for the corresponding site loaded over HTTPS (e.g., `https://example.com`).

For documents loaded from `file:` URLs (that is, files opened in the browser directly from the user's local filesystem, rather than being served from a web server) the requirements for `localStorage` behavior are undefined and may vary among different browsers.

In all current browsers, `localStorage` seems to return a different object for each `file:` URL. In other words, each `file:` URL seems to have its own unique local-storage area. But there are no guarantees about that behavior, so you shouldn't rely on it because, as mentioned above, the requirements for `file:` URLs remain undefined. So it's possible that browsers may change their `file:` URL handling for `localStorage` at any time. In fact some browsers _have_ changed their handling for it over time.

## Examples

The following snippet accesses the current domain's local {{DOMxRef("Storage")}} object and adds a data item to it using {{DOMxRef("Storage.setItem()")}}.

```js
localStorage.setItem("myCat", "Tom");
```

The syntax for reading the `localStorage` item is as follows:

```js
const cat = localStorage.getItem("myCat");
```

The syntax for removing the `localStorage` item is as follows:

```js
localStorage.removeItem("myCat");
```

The syntax for removing all the `localStorage` items is as follows:

```js
localStorage.clear();
```
