> **Note:** Since Firefox 57 (initially Nightly-only), both the `content` and `_content` variants are only available to chrome (privileged) code, and not available to the web anymore.

Returns a [Window object](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window) for the primary content window. This is useful in XUL windows that have a `<browser>` (or `tabbrowser` or `<iframe>`) with `type="content-primary"` attribute on it â€” the most famous example is Firefox main window, `browser.xul`. In such cases, `content` returns a reference to the `Window` object for the document currently displayed in the browser. It is a shortcut for `browserRef.contentWindow`.

In unprivileged content (webpages), `content` is normally equivalent to [top](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/top) (except in the case of a webpage loaded in a sidebar, `content` still refers to the `Window` of the currently selected tab).

> **Note:** Some examples use `_content` instead of `content`. The former has been deprecated for a long time, and you should use `content` in any new code.

### Syntax

```js
var windowObject = window.content;
```

### Example

Executing the following code in a chrome XUL window with a `<browser type="content-primary"/>` element in it draws a red border around the first div on the page currently displayed in the browser:

    content.document.getElementsByTagName("div")[0].style.border = "solid red 1px";

### Specifications

None.
