<div>{{ApiRef("HTML DOM")}}</div>

<p>The <strong><code>window.postMessage()</code></strong> method safely enables
  cross-origin communication between {{domxref("Window")}} objects; <em>e.g.,</em> between
  a page and a pop-up that it spawned, or between a page and an iframe embedded within it.
</p>

<p>Normally, scripts on different pages are allowed to access each other if and only if
  the pages they originate from share the same protocol, port number, and host (also known
  as the "<a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">same-origin policy</a>").
  <code>window.postMessage()</code> provides a controlled mechanism to securely circumvent
  this restriction (if used properly).</p>

<p>Broadly, one window may obtain a reference to another (<em>e.g.,</em> via
  <code>targetWindow = window.opener</code>), and then dispatch a
  {{domxref("MessageEvent")}} on it with <code>targetWindow.postMessage()</code>. The
  receiving window is then free to <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Event_handlers">handle this event</a> as needed. The arguments passed to <code>window.postMessage()</code>
  (<em>i.e.,</em> the “message”) are <a href="#the_dispatched_event">exposed to the receiving window through the event object</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush: js"><em>targetWindow</em>.postMessage(<em>message</em>, <em>targetOrigin</em>, [<em>transfer</em>]);</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><code><em>targetWindow</em></code></dt>
  <dd>A reference to the window that will receive the message. Methods for obtaining such
    a reference include:
    <ul>
      <li>{{domxref("window.open")}} (to spawn a new window and then reference it),</li>
      <li>{{domxref("window.opener")}} (to reference the window that spawned this one),
      </li>
      <li>{{domxref("HTMLIFrameElement.contentWindow")}} (to reference an embedded
        {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} from its parent window),</li>
      <li>{{domxref("window.parent")}} (to reference the parent window from within an
        embedded {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}), or</li>
      <li>{{domxref("window.frames")}} + an index value (named or numeric).</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt><code><em>message</em></code></dt>
  <dd>Data to be sent to the other window. The data is serialized using
    {{domxref("Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm", "the structured clone
    algorithm")}}. This means you can pass a broad variety of data objects safely to the
    destination window without having to serialize them yourself.</dd>
  <dt><code><em>targetOrigin</em></code></dt>
  <dd>Specifies what the origin of <code>targetWindow</code> must be for the event to be
    dispatched, either as the literal string <code>"*"</code> (indicating no preference)
    or as a URI. If at the time the event is scheduled to be dispatched the scheme,
    hostname, or port of <code>targetWindow</code>'s document does not match that provided
    in <code>targetOrigin</code>, the event will not be dispatched; only if all three
    match will the event be dispatched. This mechanism provides control over where
    messages are sent; for example, if <code>postMessage()</code> was used to transmit a
    password, it would be absolutely critical that this argument be a URI whose origin is
    the same as the intended receiver of the message containing the password, to prevent
    interception of the password by a malicious third party. <strong>Always provide a
      specific <code>targetOrigin</code>, not <code>*</code>, if you know where the other
      window's document should be located. Failing to provide a specific target discloses
      the data you send to any interested malicious site.</strong></dd>
  <dt><code><em><strong>transfer</strong></em></code> {{optional_Inline}}</dt>
  <dd>Is a sequence of {{domxref("Transferable")}} objects that are transferred with the
    message. The ownership of these objects is given to the destination side and they are
    no longer usable on the sending side.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="The_dispatched_event">The dispatched event</h2>

<p>A <code>window</code> can listen for dispatched messages by executing the following
  JavaScript:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">window.addEventListener("message", (event) =&gt; {
  if (event.origin !== "http://example.org:8080")
    return;

  // ...
}, false);
</pre>

<p>The properties of the dispatched message are:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>data</code></dt>
  <dd>The object passed from the other window.</dd>
  <dt><code>origin</code></dt>
  <dd>The {{Glossary("origin")}} of the window that sent the message at the time
    <code>postMessage</code> was called. This string is the concatenation of the protocol
    and "://", the host name if one exists, and ":" followed by a port number if a port is
    present and differs from the default port for the given protocol. Examples of typical
    origins are <code>https://example.org</code> (implying port
    <code>443</code>), <code>http://example.net</code> (implying port
    <code>80</code>), and <code>http://example.com:8080</code>. Note that
    this origin is <em>not</em> guaranteed to be the current or future origin of that
    window, which might have been navigated to a different location since
    <code>postMessage</code> was called.</dd>
  <dt><code>source</code></dt>
  <dd>A reference to the {{domxref("window")}} object that sent the message; you can use
    this to establish two-way communication between two windows with different origins.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Security_concerns">Security concerns</h2>

<p><strong>If you do not expect to receive messages from other sites, <em>do not</em> add
    any event listeners for <code>message</code> events.</strong> This is a completely
  foolproof way to avoid security problems.</p>

<p>If you do expect to receive messages from other sites, <strong>always verify the
    sender's identity</strong> using the <code>origin</code> and possibly
  <code>source</code> properties. Any window (including, for example,
  <code>http://evil.example.com</code>) can send a message to any other window,
  and you have no guarantees that an unknown sender will not send malicious messages.
  Having verified identity, however, you still should <strong>always verify the syntax of
    the received message</strong>. Otherwise, a security hole in the site you trusted to
  send only trusted messages could then open a cross-site scripting hole in your site.</p>

<p><strong>Always specify an exact target origin, not <code>*</code>, when you use
    <code>postMessage</code> to send data to other windows.</strong> A malicious site can
  change the location of the window without your knowledge, and therefore it can intercept
  the data sent using <code>postMessage</code>.</p>

<h3 id="Secure_shared_memory_messaging">Secure shared memory messaging</h3>

<p>If <code>postMessage()</code> throws when used with {{jsxref("SharedArrayBuffer")}}
  objects, you might need to make sure you cross-site isolated your site properly. Shared
  memory is gated behind two HTTP headers:</p>

<ul>
  <li>{{HTTPHeader("Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy")}} with <code>same-origin</code> as value
    (protects your origin from attackers)</li>
  <li>{{HTTPHeader("Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy")}} with <code>require-corp</code> as
    value (protects victims from your origin)</li>
</ul>

<pre class="brush: plain">Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
</pre>

<p>To check if cross origin isolation has been successful, you can test against the
  {{domxref("WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope.crossOriginIsolated", "crossOriginIsolated")}}
  property available to window and worker contexts:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">if (crossOriginIsolated) {
  // Post SharedArrayBuffer
} else {
  // Do something else
}</pre>

<p>See also {{jsxref("Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer/Planned_changes", "Planned changes
  to shared memory", "", 1)}} which is starting to roll out to browsers (Firefox 79, for
  example).</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<pre class="brush: js">/*
 * In window A's scripts, with A being on &lt;http://example.com:8080&gt;:
 */

var popup = window.open(/* popup details */);

// When the popup has fully loaded, if not blocked by a popup blocker:

// This does nothing, assuming the window hasn't changed its location.
popup.postMessage("The user is 'bob' and the password is 'secret'",
                  "https://secure.example.net");

// This will successfully queue a message to be sent to the popup, assuming
// the window hasn't changed its location.
popup.postMessage("hello there!", "http://example.com");

window.addEventListener("message", (event) =&gt; {
  // Do we trust the sender of this message?  (might be
  // different from what we originally opened, for example).
  if (event.origin !== "http://example.com")
    return;

  // event.source is popup
  // event.data is "hi there yourself!  the secret response is: rheeeeet!"
}, false);
</pre>

<pre class="brush: js">/*
 * In the popup's scripts, running on &lt;http://example.com&gt;:
 */

// Called sometime after postMessage is called
window.addEventListener("message", (event) =&gt; {
  // Do we trust the sender of this message?
  if (event.origin !== "http://example.com:8080")
    return;

  // event.source is window.opener
  // event.data is "hello there!"

  // Assuming you've verified the origin of the received message (which
  // you must do in any case), a convenient idiom for replying to a
  // message is to call postMessage on event.source and provide
  // event.origin as the targetOrigin.
  event.source.postMessage("hi there yourself!  the secret response " +
                           "is: rheeeeet!",
                           event.origin);
}, false);
</pre>

<h3 id="Notes">Notes</h3>

<p>Any window may access this method on any other window, at any time, regardless of the
  location of the document in the window, to send it a message. Consequently, any event
  listener used to receive messages <strong>must</strong> first check the identity of the
  sender of the message, using the <code>origin</code> and possibly <code>source</code>
  properties. This cannot be overstated: <strong>Failure to check the <code>origin</code>
    and possibly <code>source</code> properties enables cross-site scripting
    attacks.</strong></p>

<p>As with any asynchronously-dispatched script (timeouts, user-generated events), it is
  not possible for the caller of <code>postMessage</code> to detect when an event handler
  listening for events sent by <code>postMessage</code> throws an exception.</p>

<p>After <code>postMessage()</code> is called, the {{domxref("MessageEvent")}} will be
  dispatched <em>only after all pending execution contexts have finished</em>.
  For example, if <code>postMessage()</code> is invoked in an event handler, that event
  handler will run to completion, as will any remaining handlers for that same event,
  before the {{domxref("MessageEvent")}} is dispatched.</p>

<p>The value of the <code>origin</code> property of the dispatched event is not affected
  by the current value of <code>document.domain</code> in the calling window.</p>

<p>For IDN host names only, the value of the <code>origin</code> property is not
  consistently Unicode or punycode; for greatest compatibility check for both the IDN and
  punycode values when using this property if you expect messages from IDN sites. This
  value will eventually be consistently IDN, but for now you should handle both IDN and
  punycode forms.</p>

<p>The value of the <code>origin</code> property when the sending window contains a
  <code>javascript:</code> or <code>data:</code> URL is the origin of the script that
  loaded the URL.</p>

<h3 id="Using_window.postMessage_in_extensions_Non-standard_inline">Using
  window.postMessage in extensions {{Non-standard_inline}}</h3>

<p><code>window.postMessage</code> is available to JavaScript running in chrome code
  (e.g., in extensions and privileged code), but the <code>source</code> property of the
  dispatched event is always <code>null</code> as a security restriction. (The other
  properties have their expected values.)</p>

<p>It is not possible for content or web context scripts to specify a
  <code>targetOrigin</code> to communicate directly with an extension (either the
  background script or a content script). Web or content scripts <em>can</em> use
  <code>window.postMessage</code> with a <code>targetOrigin</code> of <code>"*"</code> to
  broadcast to every listener, but this is discouraged, since an extension cannot be
  certain the origin of such messages, and other listeners (including those you do not
  control) can listen in.</p>

<p>Content scripts should use {{WebExtAPIRef("runtime.sendMessage")}} to communicate with
  the background script. Web context scripts can use custom events to communicate with
  content scripts (with randomly generated event names, if needed, to prevent snooping
  from the guest page).</p>

<p>Lastly, posting a message to a page at a <code>file:</code> URL currently requires that
  the <code>targetOrigin</code> argument be <code>"*"</code>. <code>file://</code> cannot
  be used as a security restriction; this restriction may be modified in the future.</p>
