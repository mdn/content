<p>The <code><strong>Window.close()</strong></code> method closes the current window, or
  the window on which it was called.</p>

<p>This method can only be called on windows that were opened by a script using the
  {{domxref("Window.open()")}} method. If the window was not opened by a script, an error
  similar to this one appears in the console:
  <code>Scripts may not close windows that were not opened by script.</code></p>

<p>Note also that <code>close()</code> has no effect when called on {{domxref("Window")}}
  objects returned by
  <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLIFrameElement/contentWindow">HTMLIFrameElement.contentWindow</a></code>.
</p>

<p>This example shows a method which opens a window and a second one which closes the
  window; this demonstrates how to use <code>Window.close()</code> to close a window
  opened by calling {{domxref("window.open()")}}.</p>
