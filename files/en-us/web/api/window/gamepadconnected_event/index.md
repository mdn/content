{{APIRef}}

The `gamepadconnected` event is fired when the browser detects that a gamepad has been connected or the first time a button/axis of the gamepad is used.

The event will not fire if disallowed by the document's {{httpheader('Feature-Policy/gamepad','gamepad')}} [Feature Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Feature_Policy).

This event is not cancelable and does not bubble.

## Examples

To be informed when a gamepad is connected, you can add a handler to the window using {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}}, like this:

```js
window.addEventListener('gamepadconnected', (event) => {
    // All buttons and axes values can be accessed through
    const gamepad = event.gamepad;
});
```

Alternatively, you can use the `window.ongamepadconnected` event handler property to establish a handler for the `gamepadconnected` event:

```js
window.ongamepadconnected = (event) => {
    // All buttons and axes values can be accessed through
    const gamepad = event.gamepad;
};
```
