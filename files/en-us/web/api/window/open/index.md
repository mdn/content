{{APIRef}}

The **`open()`** method of the {{domxref('Window')}} interface loads a specified resource into a new or existing browsing context (that is, tab, window, or {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}) under a specified name.

## Syntax

```js
open();
open(url);
open(url, target);
open(url, target, windowFeatures);
```

### Parameters

- `url` {{optional_inline}}
  - : A string indicating the URL or path of the resource to be loaded. If an empty string (`""`) is specified or this parameter is omitted, a blank page is opened into the targeted browsing context.

- `target` {{optional_inline}}
  - : A string, without whitespace, specifying the {{domxref("window/name", "name")}} of the browsing context the resource is being loaded into. If the name doesn't identify an existing context, a new context is created and given the specified name. The special [`target` keywords](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#attr-target), `_self`, `_blank`, `_parent`, and `_top`, can also be used.

    This name can be used as the `target` attribute of
    {{HTMLElement("a", "", "#attr-target")}} or {{HTMLElement("form", "",
    "#attr-target")}} elements.

- `windowFeatures` {{optional_inline}}
  - : A string containing a comma-separated list of window features in the form _name=value_ â€” or for boolean features, just _name_. These features include options such as the window's default size and position, whether or not to open a minimal popup window, and so forth. The following options are supported:
    - `popup`
      - : If this feature is enabled, it requests that a minimal popup window be used. The UI features included in the popup window will be automatically decided by the browser, generally including an address bar only.

        If `popup` is not enabled, and there are no window features declared, the new browsing context will be a tab.

        > **Note:** Specifying any features in the _windowFeatures_ parameter, other than `noopener` or `noreferrer`, also has the effect of requesting a popup.

        To enable the feature, specify `popup` either with no value at all, or else set it to `yes`, `1`, or `true`.

        Example: `popup=yes`, `popup=1`, `popup=true`, and `popup` all have identical results.

        > **Note:** [The `true` value was introduced in March 2022](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/7425).
        > For better compatibility with older browsers, use one of the other values.

    - `width` or `innerWidth`
      - : Specifies the width of the content area, including scrollbars. The minimum required value is 100.

    - `height` or `innerHeight`
      - : Specifies the height of the content area, including scrollbars. The minimum required value is 100.

    - `left` or `screenX`
      - : Specifies the distance in pixels from the left side of the work area as defined by the user's operating system where the new window will be generated.

    - `top` or `screenY`
      - : Specifies the distance in pixels from the top side of the work area as defined by the user's operating system where the new window will be generated.

    - `noopener`
      - : If this feature is set, the new window will not have access to the originating window via {{domxref("Window.opener")}} and returns `null`.

        When `noopener` is used, non-empty target names, other than `_top`, `_self`, and `_parent`, are treated like `_blank` in terms of deciding whether to open a new browsing context.

    - `noreferrer`
      - : If this feature is set, the browser will omit the {{HTTPHeader("Referer")}} header, as well as set `noopener` to true. See [`rel="noreferrer"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types#noreferrer) for more information.

### Return value

A [WindowProxy](/en-US/docs/Glossary/WindowProxy) object. The returned reference can be used to access properties and methods of the new window as long as it complies with [Same-origin policy](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) security requirements.

## Description

The {{domxref("Window")}} interface's open() method takes a URL as a parameter, and loads the resource it identifies into a new or existing tab or window. The target parameter determines which window or tab to load the resource into, and the windowFeatures parameter can be used to control the size and position of a new window, and to open the new window as a popup with minimal UI features.

Note that remote URLs won't load immediately. When window.open() returns, the window always contains about:blank. The actual fetching of the URL is deferred and starts after the current script block finishes executing. The window creation and the loading of the referenced resource are done asynchronously.

## Examples

The following example demonstrates how to implement the `popup` feature.

```js
let windowObjectReference;
let windowFeatures = "popup";

function openRequestedPopup() {
  windowObjectReference = window.open("http://www.mozilla.org/", "mozillaWindow", windowFeatures);
}
```

We can also control the size and position of the new window.

```js
let windowObjectReference;
let windowFeatures = "left=100,top=100,width=320,height=320";

function openRequestedPopup() {
  windowObjectReference = window.open("http://www.mozilla.org/", "mozillaWindow", windowFeatures);
}
```

Alternatively, we can open a new _tab_ by omitting window features.

```js
let windowObjectReference;

function openRequestedPopup() {
  windowObjectReference = window.open("http://www.mozilla.org/", "mozillaTab");
}
```

## Best practices

```js
<script type="text/javascript">
var windowObjectReference = null; // global variable
function openFFPromotionPopup() {
  if(windowObjectReference == null || windowObjectReference.closed)
  /* if the pointer to the window object in memory does not exist
     or if such pointer exists but the window was closed */
  {
    windowObjectReference = window.open("http://www.spreadfirefox.com/",
   "PromoteFirefoxWindowName", "popup");
    /* then create it. The new window will be created and
       will be brought on top of any other window. */
  }
  else
  {
    windowObjectReference.focus();
    /* else the window reference must exist and the window
       is not closed; therefore, we can bring it back on top of any other
       window with the focus() method. There would be no need to re-create
       the window or to reload the referenced resource. */
  };
}
</script>
(...)
<p><a
 href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/"
 target="PromoteFirefoxWindowName"
 onclick="openFFPromotionPopup(); return false;"
 title="This link will create a new window or will re-use an already opened one"
>Promote Firefox adoption</a></p>
```

The above code solves a few usability problems related to links opening secondary
window. The purpose of the `return false` in the code is to cancel default
action of the link: if the onclick event handler is executed, then there is no need to
execute the default action of the link. But if JavaScript support is disabled or
non-existent on the user's browser, then the onclick event handler is ignored and the
browser loads the referenced resource in the target frame or window that has the name
"PromoteFirefoxWindowName". If no frame nor window has the name
"PromoteFirefoxWindowName", then the browser will create a new window and will name it
"PromoteFirefoxWindowName".

that opens a new window?](https://www.htmlhelp.com/faq/html/links.html#new-window)

You can also parameterize the function to make it versatile, functional in more
situations, therefore re-usable in scripts and webpages:

```js
<script type="text/javascript">
var windowObjectReference = null; // global variable
function openRequestedPopup(url, windowName) {
  if(windowObjectReference == null || windowObjectReference.closed) {
    windowObjectReference = window.open(url, windowName, "popup");
  } else {
    windowObjectReference.focus();
  };
}
</script>
(...)
<p><a
 href="http://www.spreadfirefox.com/"
 target="PromoteFirefoxWindow"
 onclick="openRequestedPopup(this.href, this.target); return false;"
 title="This link will create a new window or will re-use an already opened one"
>Promote Firefox adoption</a></p>
```

You can also make such function able to open only 1 secondary window and to reuse such
single secondary window for other links in this manner:

```js
<script type="text/javascript">
var windowObjectReference = null; // global variable
var PreviousUrl; /* global variable that will store the
                    url currently in the secondary window */
function openRequestedSinglePopup(url) {
  if(windowObjectReference == null || windowObjectReference.closed) {
    windowObjectReference = window.open(url, "SingleSecondaryWindowName",
         "popup");
  } else if(PreviousUrl != url) {
    windowObjectReference = window.open(url, "SingleSecondaryWindowName",
      "popup");
    /* if the resource to load is different,
       then we load it in the already opened secondary window and then
       we bring such window back on top/in front of its parent window. */
    windowObjectReference.focus();
  } else {
    windowObjectReference.focus();
  };
  PreviousUrl = url;
  /* explanation: we store the current url in order to compare url
     in the event of another call of this function. */
}
</script>
(...)

## FAQ

- How can I prevent the confirmation message asking the user whether they want to
  close the window?

  - : You cannot. **New windows not opened by JavaScript cannot as a rule be closed
    by JavaScript.** The JavaScript Console in Mozilla-based browsers will report
    the warning message:
    `"Scripts may not close windows that were not opened by script."` Otherwise
    the history of URLs visited during the browser session would be lost.

    More on the {{domxref("window.close()")}} method.

- How can I bring back the window if it is minimized or behind another window?
  - : First check for the existence of the window object reference of such window and if
    it exists and if it has not been closed, then use the [focus()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/focus) method. There is no other reliable
    way. You can examine an [example explaining how to use the
    focus() method](#best_practices).
- How do I force a maximized window?
  - : You cannot. All browser manufacturers try to make the opening of new secondary
    windows noticed by users and noticeable by users to avoid confusion, to avoid
    disorienting users.
- How do I turn off window resizability or remove toolbars?
  - : You cannot force this. Users with Mozilla-based browsers have absolute control over
    window functionalities like resizability, scrollability and toolbars presence via user
    preferences in `about:config`. Since your users are the ones who are
    supposed to use such windows (and not you, being the web author), the best is to avoid
    interfering with their habits and preferences. We recommend to always set the
    resizability and scrollbars presence (if needed) to yes to insure accessibility to
    content and usability of windows. This is in the best interests of both the web author
    and the users.
- How do I resize a window to fit its content?

  - : You cannot reliably because the users can prevent the window from being resized by
    setting `dom.disable_window_move_resize` to `true` in
    `about:config` or by editing accordingly their [user.js file](https://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/edit#user).

    In general, users usually disable moving and resizing of existing windows because
    allowing authors' scripts to do so has been abused overwhelmingly in the past and the
    rare scripts that do not abuse such feature are often wrong, inaccurate when resizing
    the window. 99% of all those scripts disable window resizability and disable
    scrollbars when in fact they should enable both of these features to allow a cautious
    and sane fallback mechanism if their calculations are wrong.

    The window method [sizeToContent()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sizeToContent)
    can also be disabled. Moving and resizing a window remotely on the user's screen via
    script will very often annoy the users, will disorient the user, and will be wrong at
    best. The web author expects to have full control of (and can decide about) every
    position and size aspects of the users' browser window ... which is not true.

- How do I know whether a window I opened is still open?
  - : You can test for the existence of the window object reference which is the returned
    value in case of success of the window\.open() call and then verify that
    _windowObjectReference_.closed return value is _false_.
- How can I tell when my window was blocked by a popup blocker?
  - : With the built-in popup blockers, you have to check the return value of
    `window.open()`: it will be `null` if the window wasn't allowed
    to open. However, for most other popup blockers, there is no reliable way.
- What is the JavaScript relationship between the main window and the secondary
  window?
  - : The `window.open()` method gives a main window a reference to a secondary
    window; the [opener](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/opener) property gives a
    secondary window a reference to its main window.
- I cannot access the properties of the new secondary window. I always get an error in
  the JavaScript console saying "Error: uncaught
  exception: Permission denied to get property
  \<property_name or method_name>. Why is that?

  - : It is because of the cross-domain script security restriction (also referred as the
    "Same Origin Policy"). A script loaded in a window (or frame) from a distinct origin
    (domain name) **cannot get nor set** properties of another window (or
    frame) or the properties of any of its HTML objects coming from another distinct
    origin (domain name). Therefore, before executing a script targeting a secondary
    window, the browser in the main window will verify that the secondary window has the
    same domain name.

## Usability issues

### Avoid resorting to window\.open()

Generally speaking, it is preferable to avoid resorting to `window.open()`
for several reasons:

- Most modern desktop browsers offer tab-browsing, and tab-capable browser users
  overall prefer opening new tabs than opening new windows in a majority of webpage
  situations.
- Most modern browsers offers a popup-blocking feature.
- Users can be using browser-built-in feature or extensions include opening a link in
  a new window or not, in the same window, in a new tab or not, in "background" or not.
  Coding carelessly to open new windows can no longer be assured of success, cannot
  succeed by force and, if it does, it will annoy a majority of users.
- New windows can have menubar missing, scrollbars missing, status bar missing, window
  resizability disabled, etc.; new tabs cannot be missing those functionalities or
  toolbars (or at least, the toolbars that are present by default). Therefore,
  tab-browsing is preferred by a lot of users because the normal user-interface of the
  browser window they prefer is kept intact, remains stable.
- Opening new windows, even with reduced features, uses considerably a lot of the
  user's system resources (cpu, RAM) and involves considerably a lot of coding in the
  source code (security management, memory management, various code branchings sometimes
  quite complex, window frame/chrome/toolbars building, window positioning and sizing,
  etc.). Opening new tabs is less demanding on the user's system resources (and faster
  to achieve) than opening new windows.

### Offer to open a link in a new window, using these guidelines

If you want to offer to open a link in a new window, then follow tested and
recommendable usability and accessibility guidelines:

#### Never use this form of code for links: \<a href="javascript:window\.open(...)" ...>

"javascript:" links break accessibility and usability of webpages in every browser.

- "javascript:" pseudo-links become dysfunctional when JavaScript support is disabled
  or inexistent. Several corporations allow their employees to surf on the web but under
  strict security policies: no JavaScript enabled, no java, no activeX, no Flash. For
  various reasons (security, public access, text browsers, etc..), about 5% to 10% of
  users on the web surf with JavaScript disabled.
- "javascript:" links will interfere with advanced features in tab-capable browsers:
  eg. middle-click on links, Ctrl+click on links, tab-browsing features in extensions,
  etc.
- "javascript:" links will interfere with the process of indexing webpages by search
  engines.
- "javascript:" links interfere with assistive technologies (e.g. voice browsers) and
  several web-aware applications (e.g. PDAs and mobile browsers).
- "javascript:" links also interfere with "mouse gestures" features implemented in
  browsers.
- Protocol scheme "javascript:" will be reported as an error by link validators and
  link checkers.

  2002](https://www.useit.com/alertbox/20021223.html), 6. JavaScript in Links, Jakob Nielsen, December 2002

  & JavaScript Living Together in Harmony](https://www.evolt.org/article/Links_and_JavaScript_Living_Together_in_Harmony/17/20938/), Jeff Howden, February 2002
- [comp.lang.javascript newsgroup
  discussion FAQ on "javascript:" links](https://jibbering.com/faq/#FAQ4_24)

#### Never use `<a href="#" onclick="window.open(...);">`

Such pseudo-link also breaks accessibility of links. **Always use a real URL for
the href attribute value** so that if JavasScript support is disabled or
inexistent or if the user agent does not support opening of secondary window (like
MS-Web TV, text browsers, etc), then such user agents will still be able to load the
referenced resource according to its default mode of opening/handling a referenced
resource. This form of code also interferes with advanced features in tab-capable
browsers: eg. middle-click on links, Ctrl+click on links, Ctrl+Enter on links, "mouse
gestures" features.

#### Always identify links that will create (or will re-use) a new, secondary window

Identify links that will open new windows in a way that helps navigation for users by
coding the title attribute of the link, by adding an icon at the end of the link or by
coding the cursor accordingly.

The purpose is to warn users in advance of context changes to minimize confusion on the
user's part: changing the current window or popping up new windows can be very
disorienting to users (Back toolbar button is disabled).

> "Users often don't notice that a new window has opened, especially if they are using
> a small monitor where the windows are maximized to fill up the screen. So a user who
> tries to return to the origin will be confused by a grayed out _Back_
> button."
> quote from [The Top Ten
> _New_ Mistakes of Web Design](https://www.useit.com/alertbox/990530.html): 2. Opening New Browser Windows, Jakob
> Nielsen, May 1999
When extreme changes in context are explicitly identified before they occur, then the
users can determine if they wish to proceed or so they can be prepared for the change:
not only they will not be confused or feel disoriented, but more experienced users can
better decide how to open such links (in a new window or not, in the same window, in a
new tab or not, in "background" or not).

**References**

- "If your link spawns a new window, or causes another windows to 'pop up' on your
  display, or move the focus of the system to a new FRAME or Window, then the nice thing
  to do is to tell the user that something like that will happen." [World Wide Web Consortium
  Accessibility Initiative regarding popups](https://www.w3.org/WAI/wcag-curric/sam77-0.htm)
- "Use link titles to provide users with a preview of where each link will take them,
  before they have clicked on it." [Ten Good Deeds in Web Design](https://www.useit.com/alertbox/991003.html),

- [Using Link Titles to Help Users
  Predict Where They Are Going](https://www.useit.com/alertbox/980111.html), Jakob Nielsen, January 1998

#### Always use the target attribute

If JavaScript support is disabled or non-existent, then the user agent will create a
secondary window accordingly or will render the referenced resource according to its
handling of the target attribute: e.g. some user agents that cannot create new windows,
like MS Web TV, will fetch the referenced resource and append it at the end of the
current document. The goal and the idea is to try to provide - **not
impose** - to the user a way to open the referenced resource, a mode of opening
the link. Your code should not interfere with the features of the browser at the
disposal of the user and your code should not interfere with the final decision resting
with the user.

#### Do not use `target="_blank"`

Always provide a meaningful name to your target attribute and try to reuse such target
attribute in your page so that a click on another link may load the referenced resource
in an already created and rendered window (therefore speeding up the process for the
user) and therefore justifying the reason (and user system resources, time spent) for
creating a secondary window in the first place. Using a single target attribute value
and reusing it in links is much more user resources friendly as it only creates one
single secondary window, which is recycled. On the other hand, using "\_blank" as the
target attribute value will create several new and unnamed windows on the user's desktop
that cannot be recycled, reused. In any case, if your code is well done, it should not
interfere with the user's final choice but rather merely offer them more choices, more
ways to open links and more power to the tool they are using (a browser).

## Glossary

- Opener window, parent window, main window, first window
  - : Terms often used to describe or to identify the same window. It is the window from
    which a new window will be created. It is the window on which the user clicked a link
    that leads to the creation of another, new window.
- Sub-window, child window, secondary window, second window
  - : Terms often used to describe or to identify the same window. It is the new window
    that was created.
- Unrequested popup windows
  - : Script-initiated windows opening automatically without the user's consent.

## Notes

### Popup condition

Most modern browsers (listed below) don't allow web content to control the visibility
of UI parts separately.

- Firefox 76 or newer
- Google Chrome
- Safari
- Chromium Edge

UI-related items of `windowFeatures` are used as a condition to
whether opening a popup or a new tab, or a new window, and UI parts visibility of each
of them is fixed.

The condition is described in detail in the ["To check if a popup window is requested"](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/window-object.html#popup-window-is-requested) section in the spec.

### Note on scrollbars

When content overflows window viewport dimensions, then scrollbar(s) (or some scrolling
mechanism) are necessary to ensure that content can be accessed by users. Content can
overflow window dimensions for several reasons that are outside the control of web
authors:

- user resizes the window
- user increases the text size of fonts via View/Text Zoom (%) menuitem in Mozilla or
  View/Text Size/Increase or Decrease in Firefox
- user sets a minimum font size for pages that is bigger than the font-size the web
  author requested. People over 40 years old or with particular viewing habit or reading
  preference often set a minimal font size in Mozilla-based browsers.
- web author is not aware of default margin (and/or border and/or padding) values
  applying to root element or body node in various browsers and various browser versions
- user uses an user stylesheet ([userContent.css in
  Mozilla-based browsers](https://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/edit#content)) for his viewing habits that increases document box
  dimensions (margin, padding, default font size)
- user can customize individually the size (height or width) of most toolbars via
  operating system settings. E.g. window resizing borders, height of browser titlebar,
  menubar, scrollbars, font size are entirely customizable by the user in Windows XP
  operating system. These toolbars dimensions can also be set via browser themes and
  skins or by operating system themes
- web author is unaware that the user default browser window has custom toolbar(s) for
  specific purpose(s); e.g.: prefs bar, web developer bar, accessibility toolbar, popup
  blocking and search toolbar, multi-feature toolbar, etc.
- user uses assistive technologies or add-on features that modify the operating
  system's work area for applications: e.g. MS-Magnifier
- user repositions and/or resizes directly or indirectly the operating system's work
  area for applications: e.g. user resizes the Windows taskbar, user positions the
  Windows taskbar on the left side (arabic language based) or right side (Hebrew
  language), user has a permanent MS-Office quick launch toolbar, etc.
- some operating system (Mac OS X) forces presence of toolbars that can then fool the
  web author's anticipations, calculations of the effective dimensions of the browser
  window

### Note on position and dimension error correction

Requested position and requested dimension values in the _features_ list will
not be honored and **will be corrected** if any of such requested value
does not allow the entire browser window to be rendered within the work area for
applications of the user's operating system. **No part of the new window can be
initially positioned offscreen. This is by default in all Mozilla-based browser
releases.**

[MSIE 6 SP2
has a similar error correction mechanism](https://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997645.aspx#xpsp_topic5) but it is not activated by default in all
security levels: a security setting can disable such error correction mechanism.
