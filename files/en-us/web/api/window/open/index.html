<p>The {{domxref("Window")}} interface's <strong><code>open()</code></strong> method loads
  the specified resource into the new or existing browsing context (window,
  {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} or tab) with the specified name. If the name doesn't exist,
  then a new browsing context is opened in a new tab or a new window, and the specified
  resource is loaded into it.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
   <p>Note that for brevity, this document will generally use the term "window" as a
   shorthand for "a browsing context in a tab or window".</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code><var>url</var></code></dt>
  <dd>A {{domxref("DOMString")}} indicating the URL of the resource to be loaded. This can
    be a path or URL to an HTML page, image file, or any other resource that is supported
    by the browser. If the empty string ("") is specified as <code><var>url</var></code>,
    a blank page is opened into the targeted browsing context.</dd>
  <dt><code><var>windowName</var></code> {{optional_inline}}</dt>
  <dd>A {{domxref("DOMString")}} specifying the name of the browsing context (window,
    {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} or tab) into which to load the specified resource; if the
    name doesn't indicate an existing context, a new window is created and is given the
    name specified by <code><var>windowName</var></code>.<br>
    <br>
    This name can be used as the target for the <code>target</code> attribute of
    {{HTMLElement("a", "", "#attr-target")}} or {{HTMLElement("form", "",
    "#attr-target")}} elements. The name should not contain whitespace. Keep in mind that
    this will NOT be used as the window's title.
  </dd>
  <dt><code><var>windowFeatures</var></code> {{optional_inline}}</dt>
  <dd>A {{domxref("DOMString")}} containing a comma-separated list of window features
    given with their corresponding values in the form "name=value". These features include
    options such as the window's default size and position, whether or not to include
    toolbar, and so forth. There must be no whitespace in the string. See
    {{anch("Window features")}} below for documentation of each of the features that can
    be specified.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Return_value">Return value</h3>

<p>A <code>WindowProxy</code> object, which is basically a thin wrapper for the
  {{domxref("Window")}} object representing the newly created window, and has all its
  features available. If the window couldn't be opened, the returned value is instead
  <code>null</code>. The returned reference can be used to access properties and methods
  of the new window as long as it complies with <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">Same-origin policy</a> security
  requirements.</p>

<h2 id="Description">Description</h2>

<p>The <code>open()</code> method creates a new secondary browser window, similar to
  choosing New Window from the File menu. The <code><var>url</var></code> parameter
  specifies the URL to be fetched and loaded in the new window. If
  <code><var>url</var></code> is an empty string, then a new blank, empty window (URL
  <code>about:blank</code>) is created with the default toolbars of the main window.</p>

<p>Note that remote URLs won't load immediately. When <code>window.open()</code> returns,
  the window always contains <code>about:blank</code>. The actual fetching of the URL is
  deferred and starts after the current script block finishes executing. The window
  creation and the loading of the referenced resource are done asynchronously.</p>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<pre class="brush:js">var windowObjectReference;
var windowFeatures = "menubar=yes,location=yes,resizable=yes,scrollbars=yes,status=yes";

function openRequestedPopup() {
  windowObjectReference = window.open("http://www.cnn.com/", "CNN_WindowName", windowFeatures);
}</pre>

<pre class="brush:js">var windowObjectReference;

function openRequestedPopup() {
  windowObjectReference = window.open(
    "http://www.domainname.ext/path/ImageFile.png",
    "DescriptiveWindowName",
    "resizable,scrollbars,status"
  );
}</pre>

<p>If a window with the name already exists, then <code><var>url</var></code> is loaded
  into the <em>existing</em> window. In this case the return value of the method is the
  existing window and <code><var>windowFeatures</var></code> is ignored. Providing an
  empty string for <code><var>url</var></code> is a way to get a reference to an open
  window by its name without changing the window's location. Otherwise the call to
  <code>window.open()</code> will just create a new window.</p>

<p>To open a <em>new</em> window on every call of <code>window.open()</code>, use the
  special value <code>_blank</code> for <code><var>windowName</var></code>.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
  <p id="Note_on_use_of_window_open">Note on the use of <code>window.open()</code> to

    functionality is not valid for all browsers and more with variable conditions.
    <s>Firefox (50.0.1) functions as described: from the same domain+port reopen with same

    on the other hand will do it only from the same parent (as if the window was created
    dependent, which is the "opener"). This is a wide limitation and generates
    unbelievable complexity of development. Firefox (51.) gets the handle but cannot run
    any <code>Element.focus()</code> while Chrome can run <code>focus()</code> from opener
    to child but not between siblings nor, reverse, from child to opener. This function is
    the lonely key to get back the handle on a window if the developer has access only to
    its name (the name can be saved with cookies or local storage but not the window
    object handle). For now 10/01/2017 the differencies of behavior found recently have

<h2 id="Window_features">Window features</h2>

<p><code><var>windowFeatures</var></code> is an optional string containing a
  comma-separated list of requested features of the new window. After a window is opened,
  JavaScript can't be used to change the features. If <code><var>windowName</var></code>
  does not specify an existing window and the <code><var>windowFeatures</var></code>
  parameter is not provided (or if the <code><var>windowFeatures</var></code> parameter is
  an empty string), then the new secondary window will render the default toolbars of the
  main window.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
  <p><strong>Tip</strong>: Note that in some browsers, users can override the
    <code><var>windowFeatures</var></code> settings and enable (or prevent the disabling
    of) features. Further, control of some window features is available only on some browsers
    and platforms (See <a href="#popup_condition">popup condition</a> section)

<p>The above code solves a few usability problems related to links opening secondary
  window. The purpose of the <code>return false</code> in the code is to cancel default
  action of the link: if the onclick event handler is executed, then there is no need to
  execute the default action of the link. But if javascript support is disabled or
  non-existent on the user's browser, then the onclick event handler is ignored and the
  browser loads the referenced resource in the target frame or window that has the name
  "PromoteFirefoxWindowName". If no frame nor window has the name
  "PromoteFirefoxWindowName", then the browser will create a new window and will name it
  "PromoteFirefoxWindowName".</p>

<h2 id="FAQ">FAQ</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>How can I prevent the confirmation message asking the user whether they want to
    close the window?</dt>
  <dd>You cannot. <strong>New windows not opened by javascript cannot as a rule be closed
      by JavaScript.</strong> The JavaScript Console in Mozilla-based browsers will report
    the warning message:
    <code>"Scripts may not close windows that were not opened by script."</code> Otherwise
    the history of URLs visited during the browser session would be lost.</dd>
  <dd>More on the {{domxref("window.close()")}} method</dd>
  <dt>How can I bring back the window if it is minimized or behind another window?</dt>
  <dd>First check for the existence of the window object reference of such window and if
    it exists and if it has not been closed, then use the <a
      href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/focus">focus()</a> method. There is no other reliable
    way. You can examine an <a href="#best_practices">example explaining how to use the
      focus() method</a>.</dd>
  <dt>How do I force a maximized window?</dt>
  <dd>You cannot. All browser manufacturers try to make the opening of new secondary
    windows noticed by users and noticeable by users to avoid confusion, to avoid
    disorienting users.</dd>
  <dt>How do I turn off window resizability or remove toolbars?</dt>
  <dd>You cannot force this. Users with Mozilla-based browsers have absolute control over
    window functionalities like resizability, scrollability and toolbars presence via user
    preferences in <code>about:config</code>. Since your users are the ones who are
    supposed to use such windows (and not you, being the web author), the best is to avoid
    interfering with their habits and preferences. We recommend to always set the
    resizability and scrollbars presence (if needed) to yes to insure accessibility to
    content and usability of windows. This is in the best interests of both the web author
    and the users.</dd>
  <dt>How do I resize a window to fit its content?</dt>
  <dd>You cannot reliably because the users can prevent the window from being resized by
    setting <code>dom.disable_window_move_resize</code> to <code>true</code> in
    <code>about:config</code> or by editing accordingly their <a
      href="https://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/edit#user">user.js file</a>.</dd>
  <dd>In general, users usually disable moving and resizing of existing windows because
    allowing authors' scripts to do so has been abused overwhelmingly in the past and the
    rare scripts that do not abuse such feature are often wrong, inaccurate when resizing
    the window. 99% of all those scripts disable window resizability and disable
    scrollbars when in fact they should enable both of these features to allow a cautious
    and sane fallback mechanism if their calculations are wrong.</dd>
  <dd>The window method <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/sizeToContent">sizeToContent()</a>
    can also be disabled. Moving and resizing a window remotely on the user's screen via
    script will very often annoy the users, will disorient the user, and will be wrong at
    best. The web author expects to have full control of (and can decide about) every
    position and size aspects of the users' browser window ... which is not true.</dd>
  <dt>How do I know whether a window I opened is still open?</dt>
  <dd>You can test for the existence of the window object reference which is the returned
    value in case of success of the window.open() call and then verify that
    <var>windowObjectReference</var>.closed return value is <var>false</var>.</dd>
  <dt>How can I tell when my window was blocked by a popup blocker?</dt>
  <dd>With the built-in popup blockers, you have to check the return value of
    <code>window.open()</code>: it will be <code>null</code> if the window wasn't allowed
    to open. However, for most other popup blockers, there is no reliable way.</dd>
  <dt>What is the JavaScript relationship between the main window and the secondary
    window?</dt>
  <dd>The <code>window.open()</code> method gives a main window a reference to a secondary
    window; the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/opener">opener</a> property gives a
    secondary window a reference to its main window.</dd>
  <dt>I cannot access the properties of the new secondary window. I always get an error in
    the javascript console saying "Error: uncaught
    exception: Permission denied to get property
    &lt;property_name or method_name&gt;. Why is that?</dt>
  <dd>It is because of the cross-domain script security restriction (also referred as the
    "Same Origin Policy"). A script loaded in a window (or frame) from a distinct origin
    (domain name) <strong>cannot get nor set</strong> properties of another window (or
    frame) or the properties of any of its HTML objects coming from another distinct
    origin (domain name). Therefore, before executing a script targeting a secondary
    window, the browser in the main window will verify that the secondary window has the
    same domain name.</dd>
  <dd>More reading on the cross-domain script security restriction: <a

<h2 id="Usability_issues">Usability issues</h2>

<h3 id="Avoid_resorting_to_window.open">Avoid resorting to window.open()</h3>

<p>Generally speaking, it is preferable to avoid resorting to <code>window.open()</code>
  for several reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Most modern desktop browsers offer tab-browsing, and tab-capable browser users
    overall prefer opening new tabs than opening new windows in a majority of webpage
    situations.</li>
  <li>Most modern browsers offers a popup-blocking feature.</li>
  <li>Users can be using browser-built-in feature or extensions include opening a link in
    a new window or not, in the same window, in a new tab or not, in "background" or not.
    Coding carelessly to open new windows can no longer be assured of success, cannot
    succeed by force and, if it does, it will annoy a majority of users.</li>
  <li>New windows can have menubar missing, scrollbars missing, status bar missing, window
    resizability disabled, etc.; new tabs cannot be missing those functionalities or
    toolbars (or at least, the toolbars that are present by default). Therefore,
    tab-browsing is preferred by a lot of users because the normal user-interface of the
    browser window they prefer is kept intact, remains stable.</li>
  <li>Opening new windows, even with reduced features, uses considerably a lot of the
    user's system resources (cpu, RAM) and involves considerably a lot of coding in the
    source code (security management, memory management, various code branchings sometimes
    quite complex, window frame/chrome/toolbars building, window positioning and sizing,
    etc.). Opening new tabs is less demanding on the user's system resources (and faster
    to achieve) than opening new windows.</li>

<p>If you want to offer to open a link in a new window, then follow tested and
  recommendable usability and accessibility guidelines:</p>

<h4 id="Never_use_this_form_of_code_for_links_&lt;a_hrefjavascriptwindow.open..._...>">
  Never use this form of code for links: &lt;a href="javascript:window.open(...)" ...&gt;
</h4>

<p>"javascript:" links break accessibility and usability of webpages in every browser.</p>

<ul>
  <li>"javascript:" pseudo-links become dysfunctional when javascript support is disabled
    or inexistent. Several corporations allow their employees to surf on the web but under
    strict security policies: no javascript enabled, no java, no activeX, no Flash. For
    various reasons (security, public access, text browsers, etc..), about 5% to 10% of
    users on the web surf with javascript disabled.</li>
  <li>"javascript:" links will interfere with advanced features in tab-capable browsers:
    eg. middle-click on links, Ctrl+click on links, tab-browsing features in extensions,
    etc.</li>
  <li>"javascript:" links will interfere with the process of indexing webpages by search
    engines.</li>
  <li>"javascript:" links interfere with assistive technologies (e.g. voice browsers) and
    several web-aware applications (e.g. <abbr
      title="Personal Digital Assistant">PDAs</abbr> and mobile browsers).</li>
  <li>"javascript:" links also interfere with "mouse gestures" features implemented in
    browsers.</li>
  <li>Protocol scheme "javascript:" will be reported as an error by link validators and
    link checkers.</li>

<h4 id="Never_use_&lt;a_href_onclickwindow.open...>">Never use
  <code>&lt;a href="#" onclick="window.open(...);"&gt;</code></h4>

<p>Such pseudo-link also breaks accessibility of links. <strong>Always use a real URL for
    the href attribute value</strong> so that if javascript support is disabled or
  inexistent or if the user agent does not support opening of secondary window (like
  MS-Web TV, text browsers, etc), then such user agents will still be able to load the
  referenced resource according to its default mode of opening/handling a referenced
  resource. This form of code also interferes with advanced features in tab-capable
  browsers: eg. middle-click on links, Ctrl+click on links, Ctrl+Enter on links, "mouse
  gestures" features.</p>

<h4 id="Always_identify_links_that_will_create_or_will_re-use_a_new_secondary_window">
  Always identify links that will create (or will re-use) a new, secondary window</h4>

<p>Identify links that will open new windows in a way that helps navigation for users by
  coding the title attribute of the link, by adding an icon at the end of the link or by
  coding the cursor accordingly.</p>

<p>The purpose is to warn users in advance of context changes to minimize confusion on the
  user's part: changing the current window or popping up new windows can be very
  disorienting to users (Back toolbar button is disabled).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Users often don't notice that a new window has opened, especially if they are using
    a small monitor where the windows are maximized to fill up the screen. So a user who
    tries to return to the origin will be confused by a grayed out <em>Back</em>
    button."<br>
    quote from <a href="https://www.useit.com/alertbox/990530.html">The Top Ten
      <em>New</em> Mistakes of Web Design</a>: 2. Opening New Browser Windows, Jakob
    Nielsen, May 1999</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When extreme changes in context are explicitly identified before they occur, then the
  users can determine if they wish to proceed or so they can be prepared for the change:
  not only they will not be confused or feel disoriented, but more experienced users can
  better decide how to open such links (in a new window or not, in the same window, in a
  new tab or not, in "background" or not).</p>

<h4 id="Always_use_the_target_attribute">Always use the target attribute</h4>

<p>If javascript support is disabled or non-existent, then the user agent will create a
  secondary window accordingly or will render the referenced resource according to its
  handling of the target attribute: e.g. some user agents that cannot create new windows,
  like MS Web TV, will fetch the referenced resource and append it at the end of the
  current document. The goal and the idea is to try to provide - <strong>not
    impose</strong> - to the user a way to open the referenced resource, a mode of opening
  the link. Your code should not interfere with the features of the browser at the
  disposal of the user and your code should not interfere with the final decision resting
  with the user.</p>

<h4 id="Do_not_use_target_blank">Do not use <code>target="_blank"</code></h4>

<p>Always provide a meaningful name to your target attribute and try to reuse such target
  attribute in your page so that a click on another link may load the referenced resource
  in an already created and rendered window (therefore speeding up the process for the
  user) and therefore justifying the reason (and user system resources, time spent) for
  creating a secondary window in the first place. Using a single target attribute value
  and reusing it in links is much more user resources friendly as it only creates one
  single secondary window, which is recycled. On the other hand, using "_blank" as the
  target attribute value will create several new and unnamed windows on the user's desktop
  that cannot be recycled, reused. In any case, if your code is well done, it should not
  interfere with the user's final choice but rather merely offer them more choices, more
  ways to open links and more power to the tool they are using (a browser).</p>

<h2 id="Notes">Notes</h2>

<h3 id="Popup_condition">Popup condition</h3>

<p>Most modern browsers (listed below) don't allow web content to control the visibility
  of UI parts separately.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Firefox 76 or newer</li>
  <li>Google Chrome</li>
  <li>Safari</li>
  <li>Chromium Edge</li>
</ul>

<p>UI-related items of <code><var>windowFeatures</var></code> are used as a condition to
  whether opening a popup or a new tab, or a new window, and UI parts visibility of each
  of them is fixed.</p>

<p>The condition is implementation-dependent and not guaranteed to be stable.</p>

<h3 id="Note_on_scrollbars">Note on scrollbars</h3>

<p>When content overflows window viewport dimensions, then scrollbar(s) (or some scrolling
  mechanism) are necessary to ensure that content can be accessed by users. Content can
  overflow window dimensions for several reasons that are outside the control of web
  authors:</p>

<ul>
  <li>user resizes the window</li>
  <li>user increases the text size of fonts via View/Text Zoom (%) menuitem in Mozilla or
    View/Text Size/Increase or Decrease in Firefox</li>
  <li>user sets a minimum font size for pages that is bigger than the font-size the web
    author requested. People over 40 years old or with particular viewing habit or reading
    preference often set a minimal font size in Mozilla-based browsers.</li>
  <li>web author is not aware of default margin (and/or border and/or padding) values
    applying to root element or body node in various browsers and various browser versions
  </li>
  <li>user uses an user stylesheet (<a
      href="https://www.mozilla.org/support/firefox/edit#content">userContent.css in
      Mozilla-based browsers</a>) for his viewing habits that increases document box
    dimensions (margin, padding, default font size)</li>
  <li>user can customize individually the size (height or width) of most toolbars via
    operating system settings. E.g. window resizing borders, height of browser titlebar,
    menubar, scrollbars, font size are entirely customizable by the user in Windows XP
    operating system. These toolbars dimensions can also be set via browser themes and
    skins or by operating system themes</li>
  <li>web author is unaware that the user default browser window has custom toolbar(s) for
    specific purpose(s); e.g.: prefs bar, web developer bar, accessibility toolbar, popup
    blocking and search toolbar, multi-feature toolbar, etc.</li>
  <li>user uses assistive technologies or add-on features that modify the operating
    system's work area for applications: e.g. MS-Magnifier</li>
  <li>user repositions and/or resizes directly or indirectly the operating system's work
    area for applications: e.g. user resizes the Windows taskbar, user positions the
    Windows taskbar on the left side (arabic language based) or right side (Hebrew
    language), user has a permanent MS-Office quick launch toolbar, etc.</li>
  <li>some operating system (Mac OS X) forces presence of toolbars that can then fool the
    web author's anticipations, calculations of the effective dimensions of the browser
    window</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Note_on_position_and_dimension_error_correction">Note on position and dimension
  error correction</h3>

<p>Requested position and requested dimension values in the <var>features</var> list will
  not be honored and <strong>will be corrected</strong> if any of such requested value
  does not allow the entire browser window to be rendered within the work area for
  applications of the user's operating system. <strong>No part of the new window can be
    initially positioned offscreen. This is by default in all Mozilla-based browser
    releases.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms997645.aspx#xpsp_topic5">MSIE 6 SP2
    has a similar error correction mechanism</a> but it is not activated by default in all
  security levels: a security setting can disable such error correction mechanism.</p>
