{{APIRef}}

The **`DOMContentLoaded`** event fires when the HTML document has been completely parsed, and all deferred scripts (`<script defer src="â€¦">` and `<script type="module">`) have downloaded and executed. It doesn't wait for other things like images, subframes, and async scripts to finish loading.

`DOMContentLoaded` does not wait for stylesheets to load, however deferred scripts _do_ wait for stylesheets, and `DOMContentLoaded` queues behind deferred scripts. Also, scripts which aren't deferred or async (e.g. `<script>`) will wait for already-parsed stylesheets to load.

The original target for this event is the {{domxref("Document")}} that has loaded. You can listen for this event on the `Window` interface to handle it in the capture or bubbling phases. For full details on this event please see the page on the Document: {{domxref("Document/DOMContentLoaded_event", "DOMContentLoaded")}} event.

A different event, {{domxref("Window/load_event", "load")}}, should be used only to detect a fully-loaded page. It is a common mistake to use `load` where `DOMContentLoaded` would be more appropriate.

This event is not cancelable.

## Syntax

Use the event name in methods like {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}}, or set an event handler property.

```js
addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {});

onDOMContentLoaded = (event) => { };
```

## Event type

A generic {{domxref("Event")}}.

## Examples

### Basic usage

```js
window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
    console.log('DOM fully loaded and parsed');
});
```
