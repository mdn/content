<p><code><strong>Window.onpaint</strong></code> is an event handler for the
  <code>paint</code> event on the window.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>funcRef</code> is a handler function.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Notes">Notes</h2>

<p><code>onpaint</code> doesn't work currently, and it is questionable whether this event
  is going to work at all, see {{ Bug(239074) }}.</p>

<p>The <code>paint</code> event is raised when the window is rendered. This event occurs
  after the {{Event("load")}} event for a window, and reoccurs each time the window needs
  to be re-rendered, such as when another window obscures it and is then cleared away.</p>
