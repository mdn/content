> **Warning:** This interface was removed from the specification and was replaced by usage of {{ domxref("DOMException") }}.

In the [IndexedDB API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API), an `IDBDatabaseException` object represents exception conditions that can be encountered while performing database operations.

## Attributes

| Attribute | Type             | Description                                        |
| --------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `code`    | `unsigned short` | The most appropriate error code for the condition. |
| `message` | `DOMString`      | Error message describing the exception raised.     |

## Constants

> **Note:** Do not rely on the numeric values of the constants, which might change as the specifications continue to change. Use the constant names instead.

        A request was aborted, for example, through a call to<a

        A mutation operation in the transaction failed because a constraint was
        not satisfied. For example, an object, such as an object store or index,
        already exists and a request attempted to create a new one.

      <td><code>NON_TRANSIENT_ERR</code></td>
      <td><code>2</code></td>
      <td>
        An operation was not allowed on an object. Unless the cause of the error
        is corrected, retrying the same operation would result in failure.

        <p>
          An operation was called on an object where it is not allowed or at a
          time when it is not allowed. It also occurs if a request is made on a
          source object that has been deleted or removed.
        </p>

          More specific variants of this error includes:

    <tr>
      <td><code>NOT_FOUND_ERR</code></td>
      <td><code>3</code></td>
      <td>
        The operation failed because the requested database object could not be
        found; for example, an object store did not exist but was being opened.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>QUOTA_ERR</code></td>

        Either there's not enough remaining storage space or the storage quota
        was reached and the user declined to give more space to the database.

    <tr>
      <td><code>TRANSACTION_INACTIVE_ERR</code></td>
      <td><code>7</code></td>

        A request was made against a transaction that is either not currently
        active or is already finished.

    <tr>
      <td><code>UNKNOWN_ERR</code></td>
      <td><code>1</code></td>

        The operation failed for reasons unrelated to the database itself, and
        it is not covered by any other error code--for example, a failure due to
        disk IO errors.

        A request to open a database with a version lower than the one it
        already has. This can only happen with
