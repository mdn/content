{{APIRef("HTML Drag and Drop API")}}

The **`files`** property of [`DataTransfer`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer) objects is a {{domxref("FileList","list of the files")}} in the drag operation. If the operation includes no files, the list is empty.

This feature can be used to drag files from a user's desktop to the browser.

> **Note:** The `files` property of [`DataTransfer`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer) objects can only be accessed from within the `drop` event. For all other events, the `files` property will be empty â€” because its underlying data store will be in a [protected mode](<https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dnd.html#the-drag-data-store>).

## Value

A {{domxref("FileList","list")}} of the files in a drag operation, one list item for
each file in the operation. If the drag operation had no files, the list is empty.
