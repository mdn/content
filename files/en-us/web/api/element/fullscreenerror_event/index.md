{{APIRef}}

The `fullscreenerror` event is fired when the browser cannot switch to fullscreen mode.

As with the [`fullscreenchange` event](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/fullscreenchange_event), two `fullscreenerror` events are fired; the first is sent to the {{domxref("Element")}} which failed to change modes, and the second is sent to the {{domxref("Document")}} which owns that element.

For some reasons that switching into fullscreen mode might fail, see [the guide to the Fullscreen API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API/Guide).

This event is not cancelable.

## Syntax

Use the event name in methods like {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}}, or set an event handler property.

```js
addEventListener('fullscreenchange', (event) => { });

onfullscreenchange = (event) => { };
```

## Event type

A generic {{domxref("Event")}}.

## Examples

```js
const requestor = document.querySelector('div');

function handleError(event) {
  console.error('an error occurred changing into fullscreen');
  console.log(event);
};

requestor.addEventListener('fullscreenerror', handleError);
// or
requestor.onfullscreenerror = handleError;

requestor.requestFullscreen();
```
