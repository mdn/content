{{APIRef}}

The **`pointercancel`** event is fired when the browser determines that there are unlikely to be any more pointer events, or if after the {{domxref("Element/pointerdown_event", "pointerdown")}} event is fired, the pointer is then used to manipulate the viewport by panning, zooming, or scrolling.

Some examples of situations that will trigger a `pointercancel` event:

- A hardware event occurs that cancels the pointer activities. This may include, for example, the user switching applications using an application switcher interface or the "home" button on a mobile device.
- The device's screen orientation is changed while the pointer is active.
- The browser decides that the user started pointer input accidentally. This can happen if, for example, the hardware supports palm rejection to prevent a hand resting on the display while using a stylus from accidentally triggering events.
- The {{cssxref("touch-action")}} CSS property prevents the input from continuing.
- When the user interacts with too many simultaneous pointers, the browser can fire this event for all existing pointers (even if the user is still touching the screen).

> **Note:** After the `pointercancel` event is fired, the browser will also send {{domxref("Element/pointerout_event", "pointerout")}} followed by {{domxref("Element/pointerleave_event", "pointerleave")}}.

## Syntax

Use the event name in methods like {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}}, or set an event handler property.

```js
addEventListener("pointercancel", (event) => {});

onpointercancel = (event) => {};
```

## Event type

A {{domxref("PointerEvent")}}. Inherits from {{domxref("Event")}}.

## Event properties

_This interface inherits properties from {{domxref("MouseEvent")}} and {{domxref("Event")}}._

- {{domxref('PointerEvent.altitudeAngle')}} {{ReadOnlyInline}} {{experimental_inline}}
  - : Represents the angle between a transducer (a pointer or stylus) axis and the X-Y plane of a device screen.
- {{domxref('PointerEvent.azimuthAngle')}} {{ReadOnlyInline}} {{experimental_inline}}
  - : Represents the angle between the Y-Z plane and the plane containing both the transducer (a pointer or stylus) axis and the Y axis.
- {{domxref('PointerEvent.pointerId')}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : A unique identifier for the pointer causing the event.
- {{domxref('PointerEvent.width')}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : The width (magnitude on the X axis), in CSS pixels, of the contact geometry of the pointer.
- {{domxref('PointerEvent.height')}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : The height (magnitude on the Y axis), in CSS pixels, of the contact geometry of the pointer.
- {{domxref('PointerEvent.pressure')}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : The normalized pressure of the pointer input in the range `0` to `1`, where `0` and `1` represent the minimum and maximum pressure the hardware is capable of detecting, respectively.
- {{domxref('PointerEvent.tangentialPressure')}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : The normalized tangential pressure of the pointer input (also known as barrel pressure or [cylinder stress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cylinder_stress)) in the range `-1` to `1`, where `0` is the neutral position of the control.
- {{domxref('PointerEvent.tiltX')}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : The plane angle (in degrees, in the range of `-90` to `90`) between the Y–Z plane and the plane containing both the pointer (e.g. pen stylus) axis and the Y axis.
- {{domxref('PointerEvent.tiltY')}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : The plane angle (in degrees, in the range of `-90` to `90`) between the X–Z plane and the plane containing both the pointer (e.g. pen stylus) axis and the X axis.
- {{domxref('PointerEvent.twist')}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : The clockwise rotation of the pointer (e.g. pen stylus) around its major axis in degrees, with a value in the range `0` to `359`.
- {{domxref('PointerEvent.pointerType')}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Indicates the device type that caused the event (mouse, pen, touch, etc.).
- {{domxref('PointerEvent.isPrimary')}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Indicates if the pointer represents the primary pointer of this pointer type.

## Examples

Using `addEventListener()`:

```js
const para = document.querySelector("p");

para.addEventListener("pointercancel", (event) => {
  console.log("Pointer event cancelled");
});
```

Using the `onpointercancel` event handler property:

```js
const para = document.querySelector("p");

para.onpointercancel = (event) => {
  console.log("Pointer event cancelled");
};
```
