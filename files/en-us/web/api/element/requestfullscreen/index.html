<p><span class="seoSummary">The <code><strong>Element.requestFullscreen()</strong></code>
    method issues an asynchronous request to make the element be displayed in full-screen
    mode.</span></p>

<p>It's not guaranteed that the element will be put into full screen mode. If permission
  to enter full screen mode is granted, the returned {{JSxRef("Promise")}} will resolve
  and the element will receive a {{Event("fullscreenchange")}} event to let it know that
  it's now in full screen mode. If permission is denied, the promise is rejected and the
  element receives a {{Event('fullscreenerror')}} event instead. If the element has been
  detached from the original document, then the document receives these events instead.
</p>

<p>Earlier implementations of the Fullscreen API would always send these events to the
  document rather than the element, and you may need to be able to handle that situation.
  Check {{SectionOnPage("/en-US/docs/Web/Events/fullscreen", "Browser compatibility")}}
  for specifics on when each browser made this change.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This method must be called while responding to a user
    interaction or a device orientation change; otherwise it will fail.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush: js notranslate">var promise = Element.requestFullscreen(options);
</pre>

<h3 id="Parameters">Parameters</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><code>options</code> {{optional_inline}}</dt>
  <dd>A {{domxref("FullscreenOptions")}} object  providing options that control the
    behavior of the transition to full-screen mode. Currently, the only option is
    {{domxref("FullscreenOptions.navigationUI", "navigationUI")}}, which controls whether
    or not to show navigation UI while the element is in full-screen mode. The default
    value is <code>"auto"</code>, which indicates that the browser should decide what to
    do.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Return_value">Return value</h3>

<p>A {{JSxRef("Promise")}} which is resolved with a value of <code>undefined</code> when
  the transition to full screen is complete.</p>

<h3 id="Exceptions">Exceptions</h3>

<p><em>Rather than throw a traditional exception, the <code>requestFullscreen()</code>
    procedure announces error conditions by rejecting the <code>Promise</code> it has
    returned. The rejection handler receives one of the following exception values:</em>
</p>

<dl>
  <dt>{{jsxref("TypeError")}}</dt>
  <dd>The <code>TypeError</code> exception may be delivered in any of the following
    situations:
    <ul>
      <li>The document containing the element isn't fully active; that is, it's not the
        current active document.</li>
      <li>The element is not contained by a document.</li>
      <li>The element is not permitted to use the <code>"fullscreen"</code> feature,
        either because of Feature Policy configuration or other access control features.
      </li>
      <li>The element and its document are the same node.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<h3 id="Compatible_elements">Compatible elements</h3>

<p>An element that you wish to place into full-screen mode has to meet a small number of
  simple requirements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It must be one of the standard HTML elements or {{SVGElement("svg")}} or
    {{MathMLElement("math")}}.</li>
  <li>It is <em>not</em> a {{HTMLElement("dialog")}} element.</li>
  <li>It must either be located within the top-level document or in an
    {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} which has the {{htmlattrxref("allowfullscreen","iframe")}}
    attribute applied to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Additionally, of course, the Feature Policy <code>"fullscreen"</code> permission must
  be granted.</p>

<h3 id="Detecting_full-screen_activation">Detecting full-screen activation</h3>

<p>You can determine whether or not your attempt to switch to full-screen mode is
  successful by using the {{jsxref("Promise")}} returned by
  <code>requestFullscreen()</code>, as seen in the {{anch("Example")}} below.</p>

<p>To learn when other code has toggled full-screen mode on and off, you should establish
  listeners for the {{event("fullscreenchange")}} event on the {{domxref("Document")}}.
  It's also important to listen for <code>fullscreenchange</code> to be aware when, for
  example, the user manually toggles full-screen mode, or when the user switches
  applications, causing your application to temporarily exit full-screen mode.</p>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>This function toggles the first {{HTMLElement("video")}} element found in the document
  into and out of full-screen mode.</p>

<pre class="brush: js notranslate">function toggleFullscreen() {
  let elem = document.querySelector("video");

  if (!document.fullscreenElement) {
    elem.requestFullscreen().catch(err =&gt; {
      alert(`Error attempting to enable full-screen mode: ${err.message} (${err.name})`);
    });
  } else {
    document.exitFullscreen();
  }
}</pre>

<p>If the document isn't already in full-screen mode—detected by looking to see if
  {{domxref("document.fullscreenElement")}} has a value—we call the video's
  <code>requestFullscreen()</code> method. We don't need to do anything special if
  successful, but if the request fails, our promise's <code>catch()</code> handler
  presents an alert with an appropriate error message.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, full-screen mode is already in effect, we call
  {{domxref("document.exitFullscreen()")}} to disable full-screen mode.</p>
