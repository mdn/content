{{APIRef}}

The **`focusout`** event fires when an element has lost focus, after the {{domxref("Element/blur_event", "blur")}} event. The two events differ in that `focusout` bubbles, while `blur` does not.

The opposite of `focusout` is the {{domxref("Element/focusin_event", "focusin")}} event, which fires when the element has received focus.

The `focusout` event is not cancelable.

## Syntax

Use the event name in methods like {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}}.

```js
addEventListener("focusout", (event) => {});
```

## Event type

A {{domxref("FocusEvent")}}. Inherits from {{domxref("Event")}}.

## Event properties
