{{APIRef("XMLHttpRequest API")}}

The **`ProgressEvent.total`** read-only property is a 64-bit unsigned integer
indicating the total size, in bytes, of the data being transmitted or processed.

When downloading a resource using HTTP, this value is taken from the `Content-Length` response header. It only counts the body of the HTTP message, and doesn't include headers and other overhead.

If the event's {{domxref("ProgressEvent.lengthComputable", "lengthComputable")}}
property is `false`, this value is meaningless and should be ignored.

## Value
