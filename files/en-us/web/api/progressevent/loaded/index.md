The **`ProgressEvent.loaded`** read-only property is an integer
representing the amount of work already performed by the underlying process. The ratio
of work done can be calculated with the property and `ProgressEvent.total`.
When downloading a resource using HTTP, this value is specified in bytes (not bits), and only represents the part of the content
itself, not headers and other overhead.
