<p>The {{domxref("XRView")}} interface's read-only <code><strong>eye</strong></code>
  property is a string taken from the {{domxref("XREye")}} enumerated type, indicating
  which eye's viewpoint the <code>XRView</code> represents: <code>left</code> or
  <code>right</code>. For views which represent neither eye, such as monoscopic views,
  this property's value is <code>none</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush: js">let <em>eye</em> = <em>xrView</em>.eye;
</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A {{domxref("DOMString")}} whose value is one of the strings enumerated by the
  {{domxref("XREye")}} type:</p>

<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<p>The primary purpose of this property is to allow the correct area of any pre-rendered
  stereo content to be presented to the correct eye. For dynamically-rendered 3D content,
  you can usually ignore this and render each of the viewer's views, one after another.
</p>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>This code, from the viewer pose's renderer, iterates over the pose's views and renders
  them. <em>However</em>, we have flags which, if <code>true</code>, indicate that a
  particular eye has been injured during gameplay. When rendering that eye, if the flag is
  <code>true</code>, that view is skipped instead of being rendered.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">glLayer = xrSession.renderState.baseLayer;
gl.bindFramebuffer(gl.FRAMEBUFFER, glLayer.framebuffer);
gl.clearColor(0,0, 0, 1.0);
gl.clearDepth(1.0);
gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT, gl.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);

for (let view of xrPose.views) {
  let skipView = false;

  if (view.eye == "left" &amp;&amp; body.leftEye.injured) ||
    skipView = updateInjury(body.leftEye);
  } else if (view.eye == "right" &amp;&amp; body.rightEye.injured) {
    skipView = updateInjury(body.rightEye);
  }

  if (!skipView) {
    let viewport = glLayer.getViewport(view);
    gl.viewport(viewport.x, viewport.y, viewport.width, viewport.height);
    renderScene(gl, view);
  }
}</pre>

<p>For each of the views, the value of <code>eye</code> is checked andÂ  if it's either
  <code>left</code> or <code>right</code>, we check to see if the
  <code>body.leftEye.injured</code> or <code>body.rightEye.injured</code> property is
  <code>true</code>; if so, we call a function <code>updateInjury()</code> on that eye to
  do things such as allow a bit of healing to occur, track the progress of a poison
  effect, or the like, as appropriate for the game's needs.</p>

<p><code>updateInjury()</code> returns <code>true</code> if the eye is still injured or
  <code>false</code> if the eye has been restored to health by the function,. If the
  result is <code>false</code>, indicating that the eye is now healthy, we render the
  scene for that eye. Otherwise, we don't.</p>
