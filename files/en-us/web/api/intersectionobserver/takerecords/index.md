{{APIRef("Intersection Observer API")}}

The {{domxref("IntersectionObserver")}} method
**`takeRecords()`** returns an array of
{{domxref("IntersectionObserverEntry")}} objects, one for each targeted element which
has experienced an intersection change since the last time the intersections were
checked, either explicitly through a call to this method or implicitly by an automatic
call to the observer's callback.

> **Note:** If you use the callback to monitor these changes, you don't
> need to call this method. Calling this method clears the pending intersection list, so
> the callback will not be run.
