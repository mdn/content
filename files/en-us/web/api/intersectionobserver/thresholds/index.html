<div>{{APIRef("Intersection Observer API")}}{{draft}}</div>

<p>The {{domxref("IntersectionObserver")}} interface's read-only
  <strong><code>thresholds</code></strong> property returns the list of intersection
  thresholds that was specified when the observer was instantiated with
  {{domxref("IntersectionObserver.IntersectionObserver", "IntersectionObserver()")}}. If
  only one threshold ratio was provided when instanitating the object, this will be an
  array containing that single value.</p>

<p>See {{SectionOnPage("/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API", "Thresholds")}} to
  learn how thresholds work.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush: js"><var><code>var <em>thresholds</em> = </code>IntersectionObserver</var>.thresholds;
</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>An array of intersection thresholds, originally specified using the
  <code>threshold</code> property when instantiating the observer. If only one observer
  was specified, without being in an array, this value is a one-entry array containing
  that threshold. Regardless of the order your original <code>threshold</code> array was
  in, this one is always sorted in numerically increasing order.</p>

<p>If no <code>threshold</code> option was included when
  <code>IntersectionObserver()</code> was used to instantiate the observer, the value of
  <code>thresholds</code> is <code>[0]</code>.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>Be careful! Although the <code>options</code> object you can specify when creating an
    {{domxref("IntersectionObserver")}} has a field named
    {{domxref("IntersectionObserver.threshold", "threshold")}}, this property is called
    <code>thresholds</code>. Confusing? Yes. If you accidentally use
    <code>thresholds</code> as the name of the field in your <code>options</code>, the
    <code>thresholds</code> array will wind up being <code>[0.0]</code>, which is likely
    not what you expect. Debugging chaos may ensue.</p>
