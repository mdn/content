{{APIRef("Web Speech API")}}

{{InheritanceDiagram}}

## Constructor

- {{domxref("SpeechSynthesisEvent.SpeechSynthesisEvent", "SpeechSynthesisEvent()")}}
  - : Creates a new `SpeechSynthesisEvent`.

## Instance properties

_The {{domxref("SpeechSynthesisEvent")}} interface also inherits properties from its parent interface, {{domxref("Event")}}._

- {{domxref("SpeechSynthesisEvent.charIndex")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Returns the index position of the character in the {{domxref("SpeechSynthesisUtterance.text")}} that was being spoken when the event was triggered.
- {{domxref("SpeechSynthesisEvent.charLength")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Returns the number of characters left to be spoken after the `charIndex` position, if the speaking engine supports it. Returns 0 if the speaking engine can't provide the information.
- {{domxref("SpeechSynthesisEvent.elapsedTime")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Returns the elapsed time in seconds after the {{domxref("SpeechSynthesisUtterance.text")}} started being spoken that the event was triggered at.
- {{domxref("SpeechSynthesisEvent.name")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Returns the name associated with certain types of events occurring as the {{domxref("SpeechSynthesisUtterance.text")}} is being spoken: the name of the [SSML](https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-synthesis/#S3.3.2) marker reached in the case of a {{domxref("SpeechSynthesisUtterance.mark_event", "mark")}} event, or the type of boundary reached in the case of a {{domxref("SpeechSynthesisUtterance.boundary_event", "boundary")}} event.
- {{domxref("SpeechSynthesisEvent.utterance")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Returns the {{domxref("SpeechSynthesisUtterance")}} instance that the event was triggered on.

## Instance methods

_The {{domxref("SpeechSynthesisEvent")}} interface also inherits methods from its parent interface, {{domxref("Event")}}._

## Examples

```js
utterThis.onpause = (event) => {
  const char = event.utterance.text.charAt(event.charIndex);
  console.log(
    `Speech paused at character ${event.charIndex} of "${event.utterance.text}", which is "${char}".`
  );
};

utterThis.onboundary = (event) => {
  console.log(
    `${event.name} boundary reached after ${event.elapsedTime} seconds.`
  );
};
```
