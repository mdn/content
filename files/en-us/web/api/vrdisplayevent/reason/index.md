{{APIRef("WebVR API")}}{{Deprecated_Header}}

The **`reason`** read-only property of the {{domxref("VRDisplayEvent")}} interface returns a human-readable reason why the event was fired.

> **Note:** This property was part of the old [WebVR API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/). It has been superseded by the [WebXR Device API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/).

## Syntax

```js
var myReason = vrDisplayEventInstance.reason;
```

### Value

A string representing the reason why the event was fired. The available reasons are defined in the [`VRDisplayEventReason`](https://w3c.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/#interface-vrdisplayeventreason) enum, and are as follows:

- `mounted` — The {{domxref("VRDisplay")}} has detected that the user has put it on (or it has been otherwise activated).
- `navigation` — The page has been navigated to from a context that allows this page to begin presenting immediately, such as from another site that was already in VR presentation mode.
- `requested` — The user agent has requested that VR presentation mode be started. This allows user agents to include a consistent UI to enter VR across different sites.
- `unmounted` — The {{domxref("VRDisplay")}} has detected that the user has taken it off (or it has been otherwise slept/put on standby).

## Examples

```js
window.addEventListener('vrdisplaypresentchange', function(e) {
    console.log('Display ' + e.display.displayId + ' presentation has changed. Reason given: ' + e.reason + '.');
  })
```

## Specifications

This property was part of the old [WebVR API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/) that has been superseded by the [WebXR Device API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/). It is no longer on track to becoming a standard.

Until all browsers have implemented the new [WebXR APIs](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Fundamentals), it is recommended to rely on frameworks, like [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/), [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/), or [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), or a [polyfill](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-polyfill), to develop WebXR applications that will work across all browsers [\[1\]](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/oculus-browser/browser-vr-xr/).
