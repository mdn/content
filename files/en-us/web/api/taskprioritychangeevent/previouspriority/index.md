{{APIRef("Prioritized Task Scheduling API")}}

The readonly **`previousPriority`** property of the {{domxref("TaskPriorityChangeEvent")}} interface returns the priority of the corresponding {{domxref("TaskSignal")}} before it was changed and this [`prioritychange`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/TaskSignal/prioritychange_event) event was emitted.

This is the value that was set in the [`TaskPriorityChangeEvent` constructor](/en-US/docs/Web/API/TaskPriorityChangeEvent/TaskPriorityChangeEvent) argument `options.previous`. <!-- link? -->

The new priority of the task can be read from `event.target.priority`.

## Value

A string, indicating the associated task's priority before it was changed.
This will be one of: [`"user-blocking"`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Prioritized_Task_Scheduling_API#user-blocking), [`"user-visible"`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Prioritized_Task_Scheduling_API#user-visible), [`"background"`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Prioritized_Task_Scheduling_API#background).

## Examples

The code below shows the `previousPriority` being obtained in a handler for a `prioritychange` event.

```js
// Listen for 'prioritychange' events on the controller's signal.
controller.signal.addEventListener('prioritychange', (event) => {
  const previousPriority = event.previousPriority;
  const newPriority = event.target.priority;
  console.log(`The priority changed from ${previousPriority} to ${newPriority}.`);
});
```
