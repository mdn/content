<p>The <strong><code>onshippingaddresschange</code></strong> event of the
  {{domxref("PaymentRequest")}} interface is fired whenever the user changes their
  shipping address, including when an address is added by the user for the first time.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js">PaymentRequest.addEventListener('shippingaddresschange', shippingAddressChangeEvent =&gt; { ... });

PaymentRequest.onshippingaddresschange = function(shippingAddressChangeEvent) { ... };</pre>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>The <code>shippingaddresschange</code> event is triggered by a user-agent controlled
  interaction. If the address stored by the user agent changes at any time during a
  payment process, the event is triggered. To make sure an updated address is included
  when sending payment information to the server, you should add event listeners for a
  {{domxref('PaymentRequest')}} object after instantiation, but before the call
  to <code>show()</code>.</p>

<pre>// Initialization of PaymentRequest arguments are excerpted for clarity.
var payment = new PaymentRequest(supportedInstruments, details, options);

request.addEventListener('shippingaddresschange', function(evt) {
  evt.updateWith(new Promise(function(resolve) {
    updateDetails(details, request.shippingAddress, resolve);
  }));
});

payment.show().then(function(paymentResponse) {
  // Processing of paymentResponse exerpted for the same of clarity.
}).catch(function(err) {
  console.error("Uh oh, something bad happened", err.message);
});
