{{APIRef("Web Speech API")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`speaking`** read-only property of the
{{domxref("SpeechSynthesis")}} interface is a boolean value that returns
`true` if an utterance is currently in the process of being spoken â€” even
if `SpeechSynthesis` is in a
{{domxref("SpeechSynthesis/pause()","paused")}} state.

## Syntax

```js
var amISpeaking = speechSynthesisInstance.speaking;
```

### Value

A boolean value.

## Examples

```js
var synth = window.speechSynthesis;

var utterance1 = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance('How about we say this now? This is quite a long sentence to say.');
var utterance2 = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance('We should say another sentence too, just to be on the safe side.');

synth.speak(utterance1);
synth.speak(utterance2);

var amISpeaking = synth.speaking; // will return true if utterance 1 or utterance 2 are currently being spoken
```
