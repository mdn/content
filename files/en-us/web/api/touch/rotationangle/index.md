## Summary

Returns the rotation angle, in degrees, of the contact area ellipse defined by {{ domxref("Touch.radiusX") }}Â and {{ domxref("Touch.radiusY") }}. The value may be between 0 and 90. Together, these three values describe an ellipse that approximates the size and shape of the area of contact between the user and the screen. This may be a relatively large ellipse representing the contact between a fingertip and the screen or a small area representing the tip of a stylus, for example.
