<p>The <strong><code>UIEvent.sourceCapabilities</code></strong> read-only property returns
  an instance of the {{domxref('InputDeviceCapabilities')}} interface which provides
  information about the physical device responsible for generating a touch event. If no
  input device was responsible for the event, it returns <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>When a single user interaction with an input device generates a series of different
  input events, the <code>sourceCapabilities</code> property for all of them will point to
  the same instance of <code>InputDeviceCapabilities</code>. For example, when a user
  lifts their finger off of a touchscreen, several UIEvents may be generated including
  <code>touchend</code>, <code>mousedown</code>, <code>click</code>, and
  <code>focus</code>. All of these events must have the same
  <code>sourceCapabilities</code> representing the touchscreen.</p>

<p>A device is considered "responsible" for an event only when that interaction is part of
  the abstraction provided by the web platform. For example, many user agents allow a
  window to be resized with a mouse or a keyboard, but this detail is not exposed to the
  web platform in any way, and so the sourceCapabilities of a resize event will typically
  be null.</p>
