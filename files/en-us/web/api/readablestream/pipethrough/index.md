{{APIRef("Streams")}}

The **`pipeThrough()`** method of the {{domxref("ReadableStream")}} interface provides a chainable way of piping the current stream through a transform stream or any other writable/readable pair.

Piping a stream will generally lock it for the duration of the pipe, preventing other readers from locking it.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
pipeThrough(transformStream)
pipeThrough(transformStream, options)
```

### Parameters

- `transformStream`

  - : A {{domxref("TransformStream")}} (or an object with the structure `{writable, readable}`) consisting of a readable stream and a writable stream working together to transform some data from one form to another.
    Data written to the `writable` stream can be read in some transformed state by the `readable` stream.
    For example, a {{domxref("TextDecoder")}}, has bytes written to it and strings read from it, while a video decoder has encoded bytes written to it and uncompressed video frames read from it.

- `options` {{optional_inline}}

  - : The options that should be used when piping to the `writable` stream.
    Available options are:

    - `preventClose`

      - : If this is set to `true`, closing the source `ReadableStream` will no longer cause the destination `WritableStream` to be closed.

    - `preventAbort`

      - : If this is set to `true`, errors in the source `ReadableStream` will no longer abort the destination `WritableStream`.

    - `preventCancel`

      - : If this is set to `true`, errors in the destination `WritableStream` will no longer cancel the source `ReadableStream`.

    - `signal`

      - : If set to an [`AbortSignal`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) object, ongoing pipe operations can then be aborted via the corresponding [`AbortController`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController).

### Return value

The `readable` side of the `transformStream`.

### Exceptions

- {{jsxref("TypeError")}}
  - : Thrown if the `writable` and/or `readable` property of `transformStream` are undefined.

## Examples

In the following example (see [Unpack chunks of a PNG](https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/png-transform-stream/) for the full code running live, and [png-transform-stream](https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/tree/main/streams/png-transform-stream) for the source code), an image is fetched and its body retrieved as a {{domxref("ReadableStream")}}.

Next, we log the contents of the readable stream, use `pipeThrough()` to send it to a new function that creates a gray-scaled version of the stream, then log the new stream's contents too.

```js
// Fetch the original image
fetch("png-logo.png")
  // Retrieve its body as ReadableStream
  .then((response) => response.body)
  .then((rs) => logReadableStream("Fetch Response Stream", rs))
  // Create a gray-scaled PNG stream out of the original
  .then((body) => body.pipeThrough(new PNGTransformStream()))
  .then((rs) => logReadableStream("PNG Chunk Stream", rs));
```
