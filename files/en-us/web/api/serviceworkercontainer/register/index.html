<div>{{APIRef("Service Workers API")}}</div>

<p><span class="seoSummary">The <strong><code>register()</code></strong> method of the
    {{domxref("ServiceWorkerContainer")}} interface creates or updates a
    {{domxref("ServiceWorkerRegistration")}} for the given <code>scriptURL</code>.</span>
</p>

<p>If successful, a service worker registration ties the provided script URL to a
  <em>scope</em>, which is subsequently used for navigation matching. You can call this
  method unconditionally from the controlled page. I.e., you don't need to first check
  whether there's an active registration.</p>

<p>There is frequent confusion surrounding the meaning and use of <em>scope</em>. Since a
  service worker can't have a scope broader than its own location, only use the
  <code>scope</code> option when you need a scope that is narrower than the default.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush: js"><em>serviceWorkerContainer</em>.register(<em>scriptURL</em>, <em>options</em>)
  .then(function(<em>serviceWorkerRegistration</em>) { ... });</pre>

<h3 id="Parameters">Parameters</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><code>scriptURL</code></dt>
  <dd>The URL of the service worker script. The registered service worker file needs to
    have a valid <a
      href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types#javascript_types">JavaScript
      MIME type</a>.</dd>
  <dt><code>options</code> {{optional_inline}}</dt>
  <dd>An object containing registration options. Currently available options are:
    <ul>
      <li><code>scope</code>: A {{domxref("USVString")}} representing a URL that defines a
        service worker's registration scope; that is, what range of URLs a service worker
        can control. This is usually a relative URL. It is relative to the base URL of the
        application. By default, the <code>scope</code> value for a service worker
        registration is set to the directory where the service worker script is located.
        See the <a href="#examples">Examples</a> section for more information on how it
        works.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Return_value">Return value</h3>

<p>A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves with a {{domxref("ServiceWorkerRegistration")}}
  object.</p>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>The examples described here should be taken together to get a better understanding of
  how service workers scope applies to a page.</p>

<p>The following example uses the default value of <code>scope</code> (by omitting it).
  The service worker code in this case, if
  included in <code>example.com/index.html</code>, will
  control <code>example.com/index.html</code>, as well as pages underneath it, like
  <code>example.com/product/description.html</code>.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  // Register a service worker hosted at the root of the
  // site using the default scope.
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js').then(function(registration) {
    console.log('Service worker registration succeeded:', registration);
  }, /*catch*/ function(error) {
    console.log('Service worker registration failed:', error);
  });
} else {
  console.log('Service workers are not supported.');
}</pre>

<p>The following code, if included in <code>example.com/index.html</code>, at the root of
  a site, would apply to exactly the same pages as the example above. Remember the scope,
  when included, uses the page's location as its base.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if this code were included in a page at
  <code>example.com/product/description.html</code>, with the Javascript file residing
  at <code>example.com/product/sw.js</code>, then the service worker would only apply to
  resources under <code>example.com/product</code>.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  // declaring scope manually
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js', {scope: './'}).then(function(registration) {
    console.log('Service worker registration succeeded:', registration);
  }, /*catch*/ function(error) {
    console.log('Service worker registration failed:', error);
  });
} else {
  console.log('Service workers are not supported.');
}
</pre>

<p>There is frequent confusion surrounding the meaning and use of <em>scope</em>. Since a
  service worker can't have a scope broader than its own location, only use the
  <code>scope</code> option when you need a scope that is narrower than the default.</p>

<p>The following code, if included in <code>example.com/index.html</code>, at the root of
  a site, would only apply to resources under <code>example.com/product</code>.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  // declaring scope manually
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js', {scope: '/product/'}).then(function(registration) {
    console.log('Service worker registration succeeded:', registration);
  }, /*catch*/ function(error) {
    console.log('Service worker registration failed:', error);
  });
} else {
  console.log('Service workers are not supported.');
}</pre>

<p>However, Servers can remove this restriction by setting a <a
    href="https://w3c.github.io/ServiceWorker/#service-worker-allowed"
    id="ref-for-service-worker-allowed">Service-Worker-Allowed</a> header on the service
  worker script, and then you can specify a max scope for that service worker above the
  service worker's location.</p>
