<p class="summary">The <strong>Web Serial API</strong> provides a way for websites to read from and write to serial devices. These devices may be connected via a serial port, or be USB or Bluetooth devices that emulate a serial port.</p>

<h2>Concepts and Usage</h2>

<p>The Web Serial API is one of a set of APIs that allow websites to communicate with peripherals connected to a user's computer. It provides the ability to connect to devices that are required by the operating system to communicate via the serial API, rather than USB which can be accessed via the {{domxref("WebUSB API")}}, or input devices that can be accessed via {{domxref("WebHID API")}}.</p>

<p>Examples of serial devices include 3D printers, and microcontrollers such as the <a href="https://microbit.org/">BBC micro:bit board</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>The following examples demonstrate some of the functionality provided by the Web Serial API.</p>

<h3>Checking for available ports</h3>

<p>The following example shows how to check for available ports and allows the user to grant it permission to access additional ports.</p>

<p>The <code>connect</code> and <code>disconnect</code> events let sites react when a device is connected or disconnected from the system. The {{domxref("Serial.getPorts()","getPorts()")}} method is then called to see connected ports that the site already has access to.</p>

<p>If the site doesn't have access to any connected ports it has to wait until it has user activation to proceed. In this example we use a {{domxref("Element.click_event", "click")}} event handler on a button for this task. A filter is passed to {{domxref("Serial.requestPort()","requestPort()")}} with a USB vendor ID in order to limit the set of devices shown to the user to only USB devices built by a particular manufacturer.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">navigator.serial.addEventListener('connect', (e) => {
  // Connect to `e.target` or add it to a list of available ports.
});

navigator.serial.addEventListener('disconnect', (e) => {
  // Remove `e.target` from the list of available ports.
});

navigator.serial.getPorts().then((ports) => {
  // Initialize the list of available ports with `ports` on page load.
});

button.addEventListener('click', () => {
  const usbVendorId = ...;
  navigator.serial.requestPort({ filters: [{ usbVendorId }]}).then((port) => {
    // Connect to `port` or add it to the list of available ports.
  }).catch((e) => {
    // The user didn't select a port.
  });
});</pre>

<h3>Reading data from a port</h3>

<p>The following example shows how to read data from a port. The outer loop handles non-fatal errors,
  creating a new reader until a fatal error is encountered and {{domxref("SerialPort.readable")}} becomes <code>null</code>.</p>

<pre class="brush: js notranslate">while (port.readable) {
  const reader = port.readable.getReader();
  try {
    while (true) {
      const { value, done } = await reader.read();
      if (done) {
        // |reader| has been canceled.
        break;
      }
      // Do something with |value|...
    }
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle |error|...
  } finally {
    reader.releaseLock();
  }
}</pre>
