<div>{{APIRef("Media Capture and Streams")}}</div>

<p>The {{domxref("MediaTrackSettings")}} dictionary's
  <code><strong>facingMode</strong></code> property is a {{domxref("DOMString")}}
  indicating the direction in which the camera producing the video track represented by
  the {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} is currently facing. This lets you determine what
  value was selected to comply with your specified constraints for this property's value
  as described in the {{domxref("MediaTrackConstraints.facingMode")}} property you
  provided when calling either {{domxref("MediaDevices.getUserMedia", "getUserMedia()")}}
  or {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints()")}}.</p>

<p>If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported by checking
  the value of {{domxref("MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.facingMode")}} as returned by a
  call to {{domxref("MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()")}}. However, typically this
  is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any constraints they're unfamiliar with.</p>

<p>Because {{Glossary("RTP")}} doesn't include this information, tracks associated with a
  <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API">WebRTC</a> {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}}
  will never include this property.</p>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A {{domxref("DOMString")}} whose value is one of the strings in
  <code>{{anch("VideoFacingModeEnum")}}</code>.</p>

<h3 id="VideoFacingModeEnum">VideoFacingModeEnum</h3>

<p>The following strings are permitted values for the facing mode. These may represent
  separate cameras, or they may represent directions in which an adjustable camera can be
  pointed.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>"user"</code></dt>
  <dd>The video source is facing toward the user; this includes, for example, the
    front-facing camera on a smartphone.</dd>
  <dt><code>"environment"</code></dt>
  <dd>The video source is facing away from the user, thereby viewing their environment.
    This is the back camera on a smartphone.</dd>
  <dt><code>"left"</code></dt>
  <dd>The video source is facing toward the user but to their left, such as a camera aimed
    toward the user but over their left shoulder.</dd>
  <dt><code>"right"</code></dt>
  <dd>The video source is facing toward the user but to their right, such as a camera
    aimed toward the user but over their right shoulder.</dd>
</dl>
