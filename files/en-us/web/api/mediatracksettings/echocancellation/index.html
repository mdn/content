<p>The {{domxref("MediaTrackSettings")}} dictionary's
  <code><strong>echoCancellation</strong></code> property is a Boolean value whose value
  indicates whether or not echo cancellation is enabled on an audio track. This lets you
  determine what value was selected to comply with your specified constraints for this
  property's value as described in the
  {{domxref("MediaTrackConstraints.echoCancellation")}} property you provided when calling
  either {{domxref("MediaDevices.getUserMedia", "getUserMedia()")}} or
  {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints()")}}.</p>

<p>Echo cancellation is a feature which attempts to prevent echo effects on a two-way
  audio connection by attempting to reduce or eliminate crosstalk between the user's
  output device and their input device. For example, it might apply a filter that negates
  the sound being produced on the speakers from being included in the input track
  generated from the microphone.</p>

<p>If needed, you can determine whether or not this constraint is supported by checking
  the value of {{domxref("MediaTrackSupportedConstraints.echoCancellation")}} as returned
  by a call to {{domxref("MediaDevices.getSupportedConstraints()")}}. However, typically
  this is unnecessary since browsers will ignore any constraints they're unfamiliar with.
</p>

<p>Because {{Glossary("RTP")}} doesn't include this information, tracks associated with a
  <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API">WebRTC</a> {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}}
  will never include this property.</p>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A Boolean value which is <code>true</code> if the track has echo cancellation
  functionality enabled or <code>false</code> if echo cancellation is disabled.</p>
