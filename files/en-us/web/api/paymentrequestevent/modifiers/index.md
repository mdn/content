The **`modifiers`** read-only property of the
{{domxref("PaymentRequestEvent")}} interface returns an array of `PaymentDetailsModifier` objects containing modifiers for payment details.

## Value

An array of `PaymentDetailsModifier` objects containing modifiers for payment details. These objects contain the following properties:

- `supportedMethods`
  - : A payment method identifier. The members of the `PaymentDetailsModifier` object only apply to the payment if the user selects this payment method.
- `total`
  - : A `PaymentItem` object containing the following properties:
    - `label`
      - : A string containing a human-readable description of the item, which may be displayed to the user.
    - `amount`
      - : A `PaymentCurrencyAmount` object (see [`total` > Value](/en-US/docs/Web/API/PaymentRequestEvent/total#value)).
    - `pending`
      - : A boolean. When set to true it means that the `amount` member is not final. This is commonly used to show items such as shipping or tax amounts that depend upon selection of shipping address or shipping option.
- `additionalDisplayItems`
  - : An array of `PaymentItem` objects providing additional display items to be included in the payment details. This member is commonly used to add a discount or surcharge line item indicating the reason for the different total amount for the selected payment method that the user agent MAY display.
- `data`
  - : An object that provides optional information that might be needed by the supported payment methods. If supplied, it will be JSON-serialized.
