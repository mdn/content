<p>Indicates how bright the screen's backlight is, on a scale from 0 (very dim) to 1 (full
  brightness); this value is a double-precision float.</p>

<p>You can read and write this attribute even when the screen is disabled, but the
  backlight is off while the screen is disabled. If you write a value of X into this
  attribute, the attribute may not have the same value X when you later read it. Most
  screens don't support as many different brightness levels as there are doubles between 0
  and 1. The value's precision might be reduced before storing it.</p>
