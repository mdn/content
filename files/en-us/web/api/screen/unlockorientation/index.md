{{APIRef("Screen Orientation API")}}{{Deprecated_Header}}

The **`Screen.unlockOrientation()`** method removes all the
previous screen locks set by the page/app. The {{DOMxRef("ScreenOrientation.unlock()")}}
method should be used instead.

> **Warning:** This feature is deprecated and should be avoided. Use the {{DOMxRef("ScreenOrientation.unlock()")}} method instead.

> **Note:** This method only works for installed Web apps or for Web pages
> in [full-screen mode](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API).

## Syntax

```js
var unlocked = window.screen.unlockOrientation();
```

### Return value

Returns `true` if the orientation was successfully unlocked or
`false` if the orientation couldn't be unlocked.

## Example

```js
var unlockOrientation = screen.unlockOrientation || screen.mozUnlockOrientation || screen.msUnlockOrientation || (screen.orientation && screen.orientation.unlock);

if (unlockOrientation()) {
  // orientation was unlocked
} else {
  // orientation unlock failed
}
```
