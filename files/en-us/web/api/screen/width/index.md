{{APIRef("CSSOM")}}

The **`Screen.width`** read-only property returns the width of
the screen in pixels.

## Syntax

```js
lWidth = window.screen.width
```

## Example

```js
// Crude way to check that the screen is at least 1024x768
if (window.screen.width >= 1024 && window.screen.height >= 768) {
  // Resolution is 1024x768 or above
}
```

## Notes

Note that not all of the width given by this property may be available to the window
itself. When other widgets occupy space that cannot be used by the `window`
object, there is a difference in `window.screen.width` and
`window.screen.availWidth`. See also {{DOMxRef("screen.height")}}.

Internet Explorer will take into account the zoom setting when reporting the screen
width. It will only return the real width of the screen if the zoom is set to 100%.
