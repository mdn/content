{{APIRef("Web Speech API")}}

The **`confidence`** read-only property of the
{{domxref("SpeechRecognitionResult")}} interface returns a numeric estimate of how
confident the speech recognition system is that the recognition is correct.

> **Note:** Mozilla's implementation of `confidence` is still
> being worked on â€” at the moment, it always seems to return 1.

## Value

A number between 0 and 1.

## Examples

This code is excerpted from our
[Speech color changer](https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/blob/main/web-speech-api/speech-color-changer/script.js) example.

```js
recognition.onresult = (event) => {
  // The SpeechRecognitionEvent results property returns a SpeechRecognitionResultList object
  // The SpeechRecognitionResultList object contains SpeechRecognitionResult objects.
  // It has a getter so it can be accessed like an array
  // The first [0] returns the SpeechRecognitionResult at position 0.
  // Each SpeechRecognitionResult object contains SpeechRecognitionAlternative objects
  // that contain individual results.
  // These also have getters so they can be accessed like arrays.
  // The second [0] returns the SpeechRecognitionAlternative at position 0.
  // We then return the transcript property of the SpeechRecognitionAlternative object
  const color = event.results[0][0].transcript;
  diagnostic.textContent = `Result received: ${color}.`;
  bg.style.backgroundColor = color;
  console.log(`Confidence: ${event.results[0][0].confidence}`);
}
```
