<div>{{APIRef("Media Capture and Streams")}}</div>

<p><span class="seoSummary">The
    {{domxref("MediaDevices")}}<code><strong>.getUserMedia()</strong></code> method
    prompts the user for permission to use a media input which produces a
    {{domxref("MediaStream")}} with tracks containing the requested types of media.</span>
  That stream can include, for example, a video track (produced by either a hardware or
  virtual video source such as a camera, video recording device, screen sharing service,
  and so forth), an audio track (similarly, produced by a physical or virtual audio source
  like a microphone, A/D converter, or the like), and possibly other track types.</p>

<p>It returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves to a {{domxref("MediaStream")}}
  object. If the user denies permission, or matching media is not available, then the
  promise is rejected with <code>NotAllowedError</code> or <code>NotFoundError</code>
  respectively.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> It's possible for the returned promise to <em>neither</em>
    resolve nor reject, as the user is not required to make a choice at all and may ignore
    the request.</p>
</div>

<p>Generally, you will access the {{domxref("MediaDevices")}} singleton object using
  {{domxref("navigator.mediaDevices")}}, like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">async function getMedia(constraints) {
  let stream = null;

  try {
    stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(constraints);
    /* use the stream */
  } catch(err) {
    /* handle the error */
  }
}
</pre>

<p>Similarly, using the raw promises directly, the code looks like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(constraints)
.then(function(stream) {
  /* use the stream */
})
.catch(function(err) {
  /* handle the error */
});</pre>

<div class="notecard note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> If the current document isn't loaded securely,
    <code>navigator.mediaDevices</code> will be <code>undefined</code>, and you cannot use
    <code>getUserMedia()</code>. See {{anch("Security")}} for more information on this and
    other security issues related to using <code>getUserMedia()</code>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush: js">var <var>promise</var> = navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(<var>constraints</var>);
</pre>

<h3 id="Parameters">Parameters</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><code><var>constraints</var></code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>A {{domxref("MediaStreamConstraints")}} object specifying the types of media to
      request, along with any requirements for each type.</p>

    <p>The <code><var>constraints</var></code> parameter is a
      <code>MediaStreamConstraints</code> object with two members: <code>video</code> and
      <code>audio</code>, describing the media types requested. Either or both must be
      specified. If the browser cannot find all media tracks with the specified types that
      meet the constraints given, then the returned promise is rejected with
      <code>NotFoundError</code>.</p>

    <p>The following requests both audio and video without any specific requirements:</p>

    <pre class="brush: js">{ audio: true, video: true }</pre>

    <p>If <code>true</code> is specified for a media type, the resulting stream is
      <em>required</em> to have that type of track in it. If one cannot be included for
      any reason, the call to <code>getUserMedia()</code> will result in an error.</p>

    <p>While information about a user's cameras and microphones are inaccessible for
      privacy reasons, an application can request the camera and microphone capabilities
      it needs and wants, using additional constraints. The following expresses a
      preference for 1280x720 camera resolution:</p>

    <pre class="brush: js">{
  audio: true,
  video: { width: 1280, height: 720 }
}</pre>

    <p id="successCallback">The browser will try to honour this, but may return other
      resolutions if an exact match is not available, or the user overrides it.</p>

    <p>To <em>require</em> a capability, use the keywords <code>min</code>,
      <code>max</code>, or <code>exact</code> (a.k.a. <code>min == max</code>). The
      following demands a minimum resolution of 1280x720:</p>

    <pre class="brush: js">{
  audio: true,
  video: {
    width: { min: 1280 },
    height: { min: 720 }
  }
}</pre>

    <p>If no camera exists with this resolution or higher, then the returned promise will
      be rejected with <code>OverconstrainedError</code>, and the user will not be
      prompted.</p>

    <p>The reason for the difference in behavior is that the keywords <code>min</code>,
      <code>max</code>, and <code>exact</code> are inherently mandatory. Whereas plain
      values and a keyword called <code>ideal</code> are not. Here's a full example:</p>

    <pre class="brush: js">{
  audio: true,
  video: {
    width: { min: 1024, ideal: 1280, max: 1920 },
    height: { min: 576, ideal: 720, max: 1080 }
  }
}</pre>

    <p>An <code>ideal</code> value, when used, has gravity, which means that the browser
      will try to find the setting (and camera, if you have more than one), with the
      smallest <a
        href="https://w3c.github.io/mediacapture-main/#dfn-fitness-distance">fitness
        distance</a> from the ideal values given.</p>

    <p>Plain values are inherently ideal, which means that the first of our resolution
      examples above could have been written like this:</p>

    <pre class="brush: js">{
  audio: true,
  video: {
    width: { ideal: 1280 },
    height: { ideal: 720 }
  }
}</pre>

    <p>Not all constraints are numbers. For example, on mobile devices, the following will
      prefer the front camera (if one is available) over the rear one:</p>

    <pre class="brush: js">{ audio: true, video: { facingMode: "user" } }</pre>

    <p>To <em>require</em> the rear camera, use:</p>

    <pre
      class="brush: js">{ audio: true, video: { facingMode: { exact: "environment" } } }</pre>

    <p>Another non-number constraint is the <code>deviceId</code> constraint. If you have
      a <code>deviceId</code> from {{domxref("mediaDevices.enumerateDevices()")}}, you can
      use it to request a specific device:</p>

    <pre class="brush: js">{ video: { deviceId: myPreferredCameraDeviceId } }</pre>

    <p>The above will return the camera you requested, or a different camera if that
      specific camera is no longer available. Again, to <em>require</em> the specific
      camera, you would use:</p>

    <pre
      class="brush: js">{ video: { deviceId: { exact: myExactCameraOrBustDeviceId } } }</pre>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Return_value">Return value</h3>

<p>A {{jsxref("Promise")}} whose fulfillment handler receives a {{domxref("MediaStream")}}
  object when the requested media has successfully been obtained.</p>

<h3 id="Exceptions">Exceptions</h3>

<p>Rejections of the returned promise are made by passing a {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  error object to the promise's failure handler. Possible errors are:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>AbortError</code></dt>
  <dd>Although the user and operating system both granted access to the hardware device,
    and no hardware issues occurred that would cause a <code>NotReadableError</code>, some
    problem occurred which prevented the device from being used.</dd>
  <dt><code>NotAllowedError</code></dt>
  <dd>One or more of the requested source devices cannot be used at this time. This will
    happen if the browsing context is insecure (that is, the page was loaded using HTTP
    rather than HTTPS). It also happens if the user has specified that the current
    browsing instance is not permitted access to the device, the user has denied access
    for the current session, or the user has denied all access to user media devices
    globally. On browsers that support managing media permissions with <a
      href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Feature_Policy">Feature Policy</a>, this error is
    returned if Feature Policy is not configured to allow access to the input source(s).
    <div class="note">Older versions of the specification used <code>SecurityError</code>
      for this instead; <code>SecurityError</code> has taken on a new meaning.</div>
  </dd>
  <dt><code>NotFoundError</code></dt>
  <dd>No media tracks of the type specified were found that satisfy the given constraints.
  </dd>
  <dt><code>NotReadableError</code></dt>
  <dd>Although the user granted permission to use the matching devices, a hardware error
    occurred at the operating system, browser, or Web page level which prevented access to
    the device.</dd>
  <dt><code>OverconstrainedError</code></dt>
  <dd>The specified constraints resulted in no candidate devices which met the criteria
    requested. The error is an object of type <code>OverconstrainedError</code>, and has a
    <code>constraint</code> property whose string value is the name of a constraint which
    was impossible to meet, and a <code>message</code> property containing a
    human-readable string explaining the problem.
    <div class="note">Because this error can occur even when the user has not yet granted
      permission to use the underlying device, it can potentially be used as a
      fingerprinting surface.</div>
  </dd>
  <dt><code>SecurityError</code></dt>
  <dd>User media support is disabled on the {{domxref("Document")}} on which
    <code>getUserMedia()</code> was called. The mechanism by which user media support is
    enabled and disabled is left up to the individual user agent.</dd>
  <dt><code>TypeError</code></dt>
  <dd>The list of constraints specified is empty, or has all constraints set to
    <code>false</code>. This can also happen if you try to call
    <code>getUserMedia()</code> in an insecure context, since
    {{domxref("navigator.mediaDevices")}} is <code>undefined</code> in an insecure
    context.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Privacy_and_security">Privacy and security</h2>

<p>As an API that may involve significant privacy concerns, <code>getUserMedia()</code>'s
  specification lays out a wide array of privacy and security requirements that browsers
  are obligated to meet.</p>

<p><code>getUserMedia()</code> is a powerful feature which can only be used in <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts">secure contexts</a>; in insecure
  contexts, <code>navigator.mediaDevices</code> is <code>undefined</code>, preventing
  access to <code>getUserMedia()</code>. A secure context is, in short, a page loaded
  using HTTPS or the <code>file:///</code> URL scheme, or a page loaded from
  <code>localhost</code>.</p>

<p>In addition, user permission is always required to access the user's audio and video
  inputs. Only a window's top-level document context for a valid origin can even request
  permission to use <code>getUserMedia()</code>, unless the top-level context expressly
  grants permission for a given {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} to do so using <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Feature_Policy">Feature Policy</a>. Otherwise, the user
  will never even be asked for permission to use the input devices.</p>

<p>For additional details on these requirements and rules, how they are reflected in the
  context in which your code is running, and about how browsers manage user privacy and
  security issues, read on.</p>

<h3 id="User_privacy">User privacy</h3>

<p>As an API that may involve significant privacy concerns, <code>getUserMedia()</code> is
  held by the specification to very specific requirements for user notification and
  permission management. First, <code>getUserMedia()</code> must always get user
  permission before opening any media gathering input such as a webcam or microphone.
  Browsers may offer a once-per-domain permission feature, but they must ask at least the
  first time, and the user must specifically grant ongoing permission if they choose to do
  so.</p>

<p>Of equal importance are the rules around notification. Browsers are required to display
  an indicator that shows that a camera or microphone is in use, above and beyond any
  hardware indicator that may exist. They must also show an indicator that permission has
  been granted to use a device for input, even if the device is not actively recording at
  the moment.</p>

<p>For example in Firefox, the URL bar displays a pulsing red icon to indicate that
  recording is underway. The icon is gray if the permission is in place but recording is
  not currently underway. The device's physical light is used to indicate whether or not
  recording is currently active. If you've muted your camera (so-called "facemuting"),
  your camera's activity light goes out to indicate that the camera is not actively
  recording you, without discarding the permission to resume using the camera once muting
  is over.</p>

<h3 id="Security">Security</h3>

<p>There are a number of ways security management and controls in a {{Glossary("user
  agent")}} can cause <code>getUserMedia()</code> to return a security-related error.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The security model for <code>getUserMedia()</code> is still
    somewhat in flux. The originally-designed security mechanism is in the process of
    being replaced with Feature Policy, so various browsers have different levels of
    security support, using different mechanisms. You should test your code carefully on a
    variety of devices and browsers to be sure it is as broadly compatible as possible</p>
</div>

<h4 id="Feature_Policy">Feature Policy</h4>

<p>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Feature_Policy">Feature Policy</a> security
  management feature of {{Glossary("HTTP")}} is in the process of being introduced into
  browsers, with support available to some extent in many browsers (though not always
  enabled by default, as in Firefox). <code>getUserMedia()</code> is one method which will
  require the use of Feature Policy, and your code needs to be prepared to deal with this.
  For example, you may need to use the {{htmlattrxref("allow", "iframe")}} attribute on
  any {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} that uses <code>getUserMedia()</code>, and pages that use
  <code>getUserMedia()</code> will eventually need to supply the
  {{HTTPHeader("Feature-Policy")}} header.</p>

<p>The two permissions that apply to <code>getUserMedia()</code> are <code>camera</code>
  and <code>microphone</code>.</p>

<p>For example, this line in the HTTP headers will enable use of a camera for the document
  and any embedded {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} elements that are loaded from the same
  origin:</p>

<pre>Feature-Policy: camera 'self'</pre>

<p>This will request access to the microphone for the current origin and the specific
  origin https://developer.mozilla.org:</p>

<pre>Feature-Policy: microphone 'self' https://developer.mozilla.org</pre>

<p>If you're using <code>getUserMedia()</code> within an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, you
  can request permission just for that frame, which is clearly more secure than requesting
  a more general permission. Here, indicate we need the ability to use both camera and
  microphone:</p>

<pre class="brush: html">&lt;iframe src="https://mycode.example.net/etc" allow="camera;microphone"&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;</pre>

<p>Read our guide, <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Feature_Policy/Using_Feature_Policy">Using Feature
    Policy</a>, to learn more about how it works.</p>

<h4 id="Encryption_based_security">Encryption based security</h4>

<p>The <code>getUserMedia()</code> method is only available in <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts">secure contexts</a>. A secure context
  is one the browser is reasonably confident contains a document which was loaded
  securely, using HTTPS/TLS, and has limited exposure to insecure contexts. If a document
  isn't loaded in a secure context, the {{domxref("navigator.mediaDevices")}} property is
  <code>undefined</code>, making access to <code>getUserMedia()</code> impossible.</p>

<p>Attempting to access <code>getUserMedia()</code> in this situation will result in a
  <code>TypeError</code>.</p>

<h4 id="Document_source_security">Document source security</h4>

<p>Because of the obvious security concern associated with <code>getUserMedia()</code> if
  used unexpectedly or without security being carefully managed, it can only be used in
  secure contexts. There are a number of insecure ways to load a document that might, in
  turn, attempt to call <code>getUserMedia()</code>. The following are examples of
  situations in which <code>getUserMedia()</code> is not permitted to be called:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A document loaded into a sandboxed {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} element cannot call
    <code>getUserMedia()</code> unless the <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code> has its
    {{htmlattrxref("sandbox", "iframe")}} attribute set to <code>allow-same-origin</code>.
  </li>
  <li>A document loaded using a <code>data://</code> or <code>blob://</code> URL which has
    no origin (such as when one of these URLs is typed by the user into the address bar)
    cannot call <code>getUserMedia()</code>. These kinds of URLs loaded from JavaScript
    code inherit the script's permissions.</li>
  <li>Any other situation in which there is no origin, such as when the
    {{htmlattrxref("srcdoc", "iframe")}} attribute is used to specify the contents of a
    frame.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<h3 id="Width_and_height">Width and height</h3>

<p>This example gives a preference for camera resolution, and assigns the resulting
  {{domxref("MediaStream")}} object to a video element.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">// Prefer camera resolution nearest to 1280x720.
var constraints = { audio: true, video: { width: 1280, height: 720 } };

navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(constraints)
.then(function(mediaStream) {
  var video = document.querySelector('video');
  video.srcObject = mediaStream;
  video.onloadedmetadata = function(e) {
    video.play();
  };
})
.catch(function(err) { console.log(err.name + ": " + err.message); }); // always check for errors at the end.
</pre>

<h3 id="Using_the_new_API_in_older_browsers">Using the new API in older browsers</h3>

<p>Here's an example of using <code>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()</code>, with a
  polyfill to cope with older browsers. Note that this polyfill does not correct for
  legacy differences in constraints syntax, which means constraints won't work well across
  browsers. It is recommended to use the <a
    href="https://github.com/webrtc/adapter">adapter.js</a> polyfill instead, which does
  handle constraints.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">// Older browsers might not implement mediaDevices at all, so we set an empty object first
if (navigator.mediaDevices === undefined) {
  navigator.mediaDevices = {};
}

// Some browsers partially implement mediaDevices. We can't just assign an object
// with getUserMedia as it would overwrite existing properties.
// Here, we will just add the getUserMedia property if it's missing.
if (navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia === undefined) {
  navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia = function(constraints) {

    // First get ahold of the legacy getUserMedia, if present
    var getUserMedia = navigator.webkitGetUserMedia || navigator.mozGetUserMedia;

    // Some browsers just don't implement it - return a rejected promise with an error
    // to keep a consistent interface
    if (!getUserMedia) {
      return Promise.reject(new Error('getUserMedia is not implemented in this browser'));
    }

    // Otherwise, wrap the call to the old navigator.getUserMedia with a Promise
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
      getUserMedia.call(navigator, constraints, resolve, reject);
    });
  }
}

navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true, video: true })
.then(function(stream) {
  var video = document.querySelector('video');
  // Older browsers may not have srcObject
  if ("srcObject" in video) {
    video.srcObject = stream;
  } else {
    // Avoid using this in new browsers, as it is going away.
    video.src = window.URL.createObjectURL(stream);
  }
  video.onloadedmetadata = function(e) {
    video.play();
  };
})
.catch(function(err) {
  console.log(err.name + ": " + err.message);
});
