{{APIRef("Audio Output Devices API")}}{{securecontext_header}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`MediaDevices.selectAudioOutput()`** method of the [Audio Output Devices API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Audio_Output_Devices_API) prompts the user to select an audio output device, such as a speaker or headset. If the user selects a device, the method grants user permission to use the selected device as an audio output sink.

Following selection, if the device is available it can be enumerated using {{domxref("MediaDevices.enumerateDevices()")}} and set as the audio output sink using {{domxref("HTMLMediaElement.setSinkId()")}}.

On success, the returned {{jsxref("Promise")}} is resolved with a {{domxref("MediaDeviceInfo")}} describing the selected device.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
selectAudioOutput()
selectAudioOutput(options)
```

### Parameters

- `options` {{Optional_Inline}}

  - : An object that configures what device(s) may be offered in the user prompt.

    - `deviceId` {{Optional_Inline}}

      - : A string representing the ID of a single previously exposed/permitted device.
        If not set, a prompt with all available audio output devices will be displayed.

        The option is intended for applications that want to store a device id so that the same device can be used by default in future sessions.
        Note that the method may return a new ID for the same device, and that persisted ids _must be passed_ through `selectAudioOutput()` successfully before they will work with {{domxref("HTMLMediaElement.setSinkId","setSinkId()")}}.

        > **Note:** A user agent may choose to skip prompting the user if a specified non-null id was previously exposed to the user by `selectAudioOutput()` in an earlier session.
        > In this case the user agent may simply resolve with this device id, or a new id for the same device if it has changed.
        > If permission for the specified device was previously granted but has since been revoked, the user-agent might display all allowed devices, highlighting the one with the specified ID.

### Return value

A {{ jsxref("Promise") }} that is fulfilled with a {{domxref("MediaDeviceInfo")}} object that describes the audio output device selected by the user.

### Exceptions

- `NotAllowedError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Returned if a [`speaker-selection`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy/speaker-selection) [Permissions Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy) is used to block use of audio outputs (in addition the popup for selecting an audio output won't be displayed), or the user closed the selection prompt without choosing a device.
- `NotFoundError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Returned if there are no available audio output devices.
- `InvalidStateError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Returned if there hasn't been a {{Glossary("transient activation")}} (you must trigger it from some kind of UI event).

## Security requirements

Access to the API is subject to the following constraints:

- The method must be called in a [secure context](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts).
- [Transient user activation](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/User_activation) is required.
  The user has to interact with the page or a UI element for this feature to work.
- Access may be gated by the [`speaker-selection`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy/midi) HTTP [Permission Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy).

The permission status can be queried using the [Permissions API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Permissions_API) method {{domxref("Permissions.query", "navigator.permissions.query()")}}, passing a permission descriptor with the `speaker-selection` permission.

## Examples

Here's an example of using `selectAudioOutput()`, within a function that is triggered by a button click.
It outputs the selected {{domxref("MediaDeviceInfo.deviceId", "device IDs", "", "nocode")}} and labels (if available) or an error message.

```js
document.querySelector("#myButton").addEventListener("click", () => {
  if (!navigator.mediaDevices.selectAudioOutput) {
    console.log("selectAudioOutput() not supported.");
    return;
  }

  // Display prompt and log selected device or error
  navigator.mediaDevices
    .selectAudioOutput()
    .then((device) => {
      console.log(`${device.kind}: ${device.label} id = ${device.deviceId}`);
    })
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error(`${err.name}: ${err.message}`);
    });
});
```

On selection of an output this might produce:

```bash
audiooutput: Realtek Digital Output (Realtek(R) Audio) id = 0wE6fURSZ20H0N2NbxqgowQJLWbwo+5ablCVVJwRM3k=
```
