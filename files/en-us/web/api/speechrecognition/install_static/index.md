{{APIRef("Web Speech API")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`install()`** static method of the [Web Speech API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) installs the required language packs for [on-device speech recognition](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API/Using_the_Web_Speech_API#on-device_speech_recognition) in the specified languages.

To check if the language packs are already available, use the {{domxref("SpeechRecognition.available_static", "SpeechRecognition.available()")}} method.

Access to the `install()` method is controlled by the {{httpheader("Permissions-Policy/on-device-speech-recognition", "on-device-speech-recognition")}} {{httpheader("Permissions-Policy")}} directive. Specifically, where a defined policy blocks usage, any attempts to call the method will fail.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
install(options)
```

### Parameters

- `options`
  - : An object specifying options for the installation. Possible properties include:
    - `langs`
      - : An array of one or more strings containing {{glossary("BCP 47 language tag", "BCP 47 language tags")}}, each representing a language that you want to install the language pack for.

### Return value

A {{domxref("Promise")}} that resolves with a boolean value indicating whether the language pack was installed successfully. The conditions that result in each return value are as follows:

- `true`
  - : All installation attempts succeeded for the requested languages, or the languages were already installed.
- `false`
  - : One or more of the requested languages are not supported, a supported language pack failed to install, or an empty array was passed for the `langs` property.

### Exceptions

- `InvalidStateError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : The current document is not fully active.
- `SyntaxError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : One or more of the strings specified in `langs` is not a valid BCP 47 language tag.

## Examples

### Checking on-device availability and installing language packs

For on-device speech recognition to work, the browser must have a language pack installed for the language you want to recognize. If you run the `start()` method after specifying `processLocally = true` but the correct language pack isn't installed, the function call will fail with a [`language-not-supported`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognitionErrorEvent/error#language-not-supported) error.

To get the correct language pack installed, ensure you follow these two steps:

1. Check whether the language pack is available on the user's computer using the {{domxref("SpeechRecognition.available_static", "SpeechRecognition.available()")}} method.
2. Install the language pack if it isn't available using the `install()` method.

These steps are handled using the following code snippet:

```js
startBtn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  // check availability of target language
  SpeechRecognition.available({ langs: ["en-US"], processLocally: true }).then(
    (result) => {
      if (result === "unavailable") {
        diagnostic.textContent = `en-US not available to download at this time. Sorry!`;
      } else if (result === "available") {
        recognition.start();
        console.log("Ready to receive a color command.");
      } else {
        diagnostic.textContent = `en-US language pack downloading`;
        SpeechRecognition.install({
          langs: ["en-US"],
          processLocally: true,
        }).then((result) => {
          if (result) {
            diagnostic.textContent = `en-US language pack downloaded. Try again.`;
          } else {
            diagnostic.textContent = `en-US language pack failed to download. Try again later.`;
          }
        });
      }
    },
  );
});
```

We first run the `available()` method, specifying one language (`langs: ["en-US"]`) to check availability for, and `processLocally: true`. We test for three different possibilities of the return value:

- If the resulting value is `unavailable`, it means that no suitable language pack is available to download. We also print an appropriate message to the output.
- If the resulting value is `available`, it means that the language pack is available locally, so recognition can begin. In this case, we run `start()` and log a message to the console when the app is ready to receive speech.
- If the value is something else (`downloadable` or `downloading`), we print a diagnostic message to inform the user that a language pack download is starting, then run the `install()` method to handle the download.

The `install()` method works in a similar way to the `available()` method, except that its options object only takes the `langs` array. When run, it starts downloading the `en-US` language pack and returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves with a boolean indicating whether the specified language packs were downloaded and installed successfully (`true`) or not (`false`).
