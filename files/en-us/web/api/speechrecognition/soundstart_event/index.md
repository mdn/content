{{APIRef("Web Speech API")}}

The **`soundstart`** event of the [Web Speech API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) is fired when any sound — recognizable speech or not — has been detected.

## Syntax

Use the event name in methods like {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}}, or set an event handler property.

```js
addEventListener('soundstart', (event) => { })

onsoundstart = (event) => { }
```

## Event type

A generic {{DOMxRef("Event")}} with no added properties.

## Examples

You can use the `soundstart` event in an [`addEventListener`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) method:

```js
const recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition() || new SpeechRecognition();

recognition.addEventListener('soundstart', () => {
  console.log('Some sound is being received');
});
```

Or use the `onsoundstart` event handler property:

```js
recognition.onsoundstart = () => {
  console.log('Some sound is being received');
}
```
