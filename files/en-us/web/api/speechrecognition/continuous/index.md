{{APIRef("Web Speech API")}}

The **`continuous`** property of the
{{domxref("SpeechRecognition")}} interface controls whether continuous results are
returned for each recognition, or only a single result.

It defaults to single results (`false`.)

## Value

A boolean value representing the current `SpeechRecognition`'s
continuous status. `true` means continuous, and `false` means not
continuous (single result each time.)

## Examples

This code is excerpted from our [Speech color changer](https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/blob/main/web-speech-api/speech-color-changer/script.js) example.

```js
const recognition = new SpeechRecognition();
recognition.continuous = false;
recognition.lang = "en-US";
recognition.interimResults = false;
recognition.maxAlternatives = 1;

// â€¦
```
