when any sound — recognisable speech or not — has been detected (when the [soundstart event](/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/soundstart_event)
fires.)

## Syntax

```js
mySpeechRecognition.onsoundstart = function() { /* ... */ };
```

## Examples

```js
recognition.onsoundstart = function() {
  console.log('Some sound is being received');
}
```
