{{APIRef("Web Speech API")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`onsoundend`** property of the
{{domxref("SpeechRecognition")}} interface represents an event handler that will run
when any sound — recognisable speech or not — has stopped being detected (when the
[`soundend`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/SpeechRecognition/soundend_event)
event fires.)

## Syntax

```js
mySpeechRecognition.onsoundend = function() { ... };
```

## Examples

```js
recognition.onsoundend = function() {
  console.log('Sound has stopped being received');
}
```
