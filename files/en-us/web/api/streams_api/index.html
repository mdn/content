<p>The Streams API allows JavaScript to programmatically access streams of data received over the network and process them as desired by the developer.</p>

<p>{{AvailableInWorkers}}</p>

<h2 id="Concepts_and_usage">Concepts and usage</h2>

<p>Streaming involves breaking a resource that you want to receive over a network down into small chunks, then processing it bit by bit. This is something browsers do anyway when receiving assets to be shown on webpages — videos buffer and more is gradually available to play, and sometimes you'll see images display gradually as more is loaded.</p>

<p>But this has never been available to JavaScript before. Previously, if we wanted to process a resource of some kind (be it a video, or a text file, etc.), we'd have to download the entire file, wait for it to be deserialized into a suitable format, then process the whole lot after it is fully received.</p>

<p>With Streams being available to JavaScript, this all changes — you can now start processing raw data with JavaScript bit by bit as soon as it is available on the client-side, without needing to generate a buffer, string, or blob.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="concept.png" style="display: block; margin: 0px auto;"></p>

<p>There are more advantages too — you can detect when streams start or end, chain streams together, handle errors and cancel streams as required, and react to the speed of the stream is being read at.</p>

<p>The basic usage of Streams hinges around making responses available as streams. For example, the response {{domxref("Body")}} returned by a successful <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch">fetch request</a> can be exposed as a {{domxref("ReadableStream")}}, and you can then read it using a reader created with {{domxref("ReadableStream.getReader()")}}, cancel it with {{domxref("ReadableStream.cancel()")}}, etc.</p>

<p>More complicated uses involve creating your own stream using the {{domxref("ReadableStream.ReadableStream", "ReadableStream()")}} constructor, for example to process data inside a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">service worker</a>.</p>

<p>You can also write data to streams using {{domxref("WritableStream")}}.</p>

<h2 id="Stream_interfaces">Stream interfaces</h2>

<h3 id="Readable_streams">Readable streams</h3>

<dl>
 <dt>{{domxref("ReadableStream")}}</dt>
 <dd>Represents a readable stream of data. It can be used to handle response streams of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch API</a>, or developer-defined streams (e.g. a custom {{domxref("ReadableStream.ReadableStream", "ReadableStream()")}} constructor).</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("ReadableStreamDefaultReader")}}</dt>
 <dd>Represents a default reader that can be used to read stream data supplied from a network (e.g. a fetch request).</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("ReadableStreamDefaultController")}}</dt>
 <dd>Represents a controller allowing control of a {{domxref("ReadableStream")}}'s state and internal queue. Default controllers are for streams that are not byte streams.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Writable_streams">Writable streams</h3>

<dl>
 <dt>{{domxref("WritableStream")}}</dt>
 <dd>Provides a standard abstraction for writing streaming data to a destination, known as a sink. This object comes with built-in backpressure and queuing.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("WritableStreamDefaultWriter")}}</dt>
 <dd>Represents a default writable stream writer that can be used to write chunks of data to a writable stream.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("WritableStreamDefaultController")}}</dt>
 <dd>Represents a controller allowing control of a {{domxref("WritableStream")}}'s state. When constructing a <code>WritableStream</code>, the underlying sink is given a corresponding <code>WritableStreamDefaultController</code> instance to manipulate.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Related_stream_APIs_and_operations">Related stream APIs and operations</h3>

<dl>
 <dt>{{domxref("ByteLengthQueuingStrategy")}}</dt>
 <dd>Provides a built-in byte length queuing strategy that can be used when constructing streams.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("CountQueuingStrategy")}}</dt>
 <dd>Provides a built-in chunk counting queuing strategy that can be used when constructing streams.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Extensions_to_other_APIs">Extensions to other APIs</h3>

<dl>
 <dt>{{domxref("Request")}}</dt>
 <dd>When a new <code>Request</code> object is constructed, you can pass it a {{domxref("ReadableStream")}} in the <code>body</code> property of its <code>RequestInit</code> dictionary.  This <code>Request</code> could then be passed to a {{domxref("WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope.fetch()")}} to commence fetching the stream.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("Body")}}</dt>
 <dd>The response {{domxref("Body")}} returned by a successful <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch">fetch request</a> is exposed by default as a {{domxref("ReadableStream")}}, and can have a reader attached to it, etc.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="warning">
<p><strong>Important</strong>: these are not implemented anywhere as yet, and questions have been raised as to whether the spec details are in a finished enough state for them to be implemented. This may change over time.</p>
</div>

<dl>
 <dt>{{domxref("ReadableStreamBYOBReader")}}</dt>
 <dd>Represents a BYOB ("bring your own buffer") reader that can be used to read stream data supplied by the developer (e.g. a custom {{domxref("ReadableStream.ReadableStream", "ReadableStream()")}} constructor).</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("ReadableByteStreamController")}}</dt>
 <dd>Represents a controller allowing control of a {{domxref("ReadableStream")}}'s state and internal queue. Byte stream controllers are for byte streams.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("ReadableStreamBYOBRequest")}}</dt>
 <dd>Represents a pull into request in a {{domxref("ReadableByteStreamController")}}.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>We have created a directory of examples to go along with the Streams API documentation — see <a href="https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/tree/master/streams">mdn/dom-examples/streams</a>. The examples are as follows:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/simple-pump/">Simple stream pump</a>: This example shows how to consume a ReadableStream and pass its data to another.</li>
 <li><a href="https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/grayscale-png/">Grayscale a PNG</a>: This example shows how a ReadableStream of a PNG can be turned into grayscale.</li>
 <li><a href="https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/simple-random-stream/">Simple random stream</a>: This example shows how to use a custom stream to generate random strings, enqueue them as chunks, and then read them back out again.</li>
 <li><a href="https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/simple-tee-example/">Simple tee example</a>: This example extends the Simple random stream example, showing how a stream can be teed and both resulting streams can be read independently.</li>
 <li><a href="https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/simple-writer/">Simple writer</a>: This example shows how to write to a writable stream, then decode the stream and write the contents to the UI.</li>
 <li><a href="https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/streams/png-transform-stream/">Unpack chunks of a PNG</a>: This example shows how <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream/pipeThrough"><code>pipeThrough()</code></a> can be used to transform a ReadableStream into a stream of other data types by transforming a data of a PNG file into a stream of PNG chunks.</li>
