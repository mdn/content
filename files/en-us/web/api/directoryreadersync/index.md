The `DirectoryReaderSync` interface lets you read the entries in a directory.

> **Warning:** This interface is deprecated and is no more on the standard track.
> _Do not use it anymore._ Use the [File and Directory Entries API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_and_Directory_Entries_API) instead.

## Basic concepts

Before you call the only method in this interface, [`readEntries()`](#readentries), create the [`DirectoryEntrySync`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DirectoryEntrySync) object. But DirectoryEntrySync (as well as [`FileEntrySync`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileEntrySync)) is not a data type that you can pass between a calling app and Web Worker thread. It's not a big deal, because you don't really need to have the main app and the worker thread see the same JavaScript object; you just need them to access the same files. You can do that by passing a list of `filesystem:` URLs—which are just strings—instead of a list of entries. You can also use the `filesystem:` URL to look up the entry with `resolveLocalFileSystemURL()`. That gets you back to a DirectoryEntrySync (as well as FileEntrySync) object.

### Example

In the following code snippet from [HTML5Rocks (web.dev)](https://web.dev/filesystem-sync/), we create Web Workers and pass data from it to the main app.

```js
// Taking care of the browser-specific prefixes.
window.resolveLocalFileSystemURL =
  window.resolveLocalFileSystemURL || window.webkitResolveLocalFileSystemURL;

// Create web workers
const worker = new Worker("worker.js");
worker.onmessage = (e) => {
  const urls = e.data.entries;
  urls.forEach((url) => {
    window.resolveLocalFileSystemURL(url, (fileEntry) => {
      // Print out file's name.
      console.log(fileEntry.name);
    });
  });
};

worker.postMessage({cmd: "list"});
```

The following is `worker.js` code that gets the contents of the directory.

```js
// worker.js

// Taking care of the browser-specific prefixes.
self.requestFileSystemSync =
  self.webkitRequestFileSystemSync || self.requestFileSystemSync;

// Global for holding the list of entry file system URLs.
const paths = [];

function getAllEntries(dirReader) {
  const entries = dirReader.readEntries();

  for (const entry of entries) {
    // Stash this entry's filesystem in URL
    paths.push(entry.toURL());

    // If this is a directory, traverse.
    if (entry.isDirectory) {
      getAllEntries(entry.createReader());
    }
  }
}

// Forward the error to main app.
function onError(e) {
  postMessage(`ERROR: ${e.toString()}`);
}

self.onmessage = (e) => {
  const cmd = e.data.cmd;

  // Ignore everything else except our 'list' command.
  if (!cmd || cmd !== "list") {
    return;
  }

  try {
    const fs = requestFileSystemSync(TEMPORARY, 1024 * 1024 /*1MB*/);

    getAllEntries(fs.root.createReader());

    self.postMessage({entries: paths});
  } catch (e) {
    onError(e);
  }
};
```

## Method

### readEntries()

Returns a list of entries from a specific directory. Call this method until an empty array is returned.

#### Syntax

```
readEntries()
```

##### Return value

Array containing [`FileEntrySync`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileEntrySync) and [`DirectoryEntrySync`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DirectoryEntrySync)

##### Parameter

None

##### Exceptions

This method can raise a [DOMException](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMException) with the following codes:

| Exception           | Description                                                                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NOT_FOUND_ERR`     | The directory does not exist.                                                      |
| `INVALID_STATE_ERR` | The directory has been modified since the first call to readEntries was processed. |
| `SECURITY_ERR`      | The browser determined that it was not safe to look up the metadata.               |
