{{APIRef("Sensor API")}}

The **`y`** read-only property of the
{{domxref("Gyroscope")}} interface returns a double precision integer containing the
angular velocity of the device along the its y axis.

If a feature policy blocks use of a feature it is because your code is inconsistent
with the policies set on your server. This is not something that would ever be shown to
a user. The {{httpheader('Feature-Policy')}} HTTP header article contains implementation instructions.

## Syntax

```js
var y = gyroscope.y
```

### Value

A {{jsxref('Number')}}.

## Example

The gyroscope is typically read in the {{domxref('Sensor.onreading')}} event callback.
In the example below this occurs sixty times a second.

```js
let gyroscope = new Gyroscope({frequency: 60});

gyroscope.addEventListener('reading', e => {
  console.log("Angular velocity along the X-axis " + gyroscope.x);
  console.log("Angular velocity along the Y-axis " + gyroscope.y);
  console.log("Angular velocity along the Z-axis " + gyroscope.z);
});
gyroscope.start();
```
