{{APIRef("IndexedDB")}} {{ draft() }}

> **Warning:** The synchronous version of the IndexedDB API was originally intended for use only with [Web Workers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers), and was eventually removed from the spec because its need was questionable. It mayÂ however be reintroduced in the future if there is enough demand from web developers.

The {{ unimplemented_inline() }} `IDBEnvironmentSync` interface of the [IndexedDB API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) will be implemented by [worker](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker) objects.
