<p>{{APIRef("Media Session API")}}</p>

<p><span class="seoSummary">The {{domxref("MediaPositionState")}} dictionary's
    <code><strong>playbackRate</strong></code> property is used when calling the
    {{domxref("MediaSession")}} method {{domxref("MediaSession.setPositionState",
    "setPositionState()")}} to tell the {{Glossary("user agent")}} the rate at which media
    is currently being played.</span> This information can then, in turn, be used by the
  user agent to provide a user interface which displays media playback information to the
  viewer.</p>

<p>For example, a browser might use this information along with the
  {{domxref("MediaPositionState.position", "position")}} property and the
  {{domxref("MediaSession.playbackState", "navigator.mediaSession.playbackState")}}, as
  well as the session's {{domxref("MediaSession.metadata", "metadata")}} to provide an
  integrated common user interface showing the currently playing media as well as standard
  pause, play, forward, reverse, and other controls.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush: js">let <em>positionState</em> = { playbackRate: <em>rate</em> };

let <em>playbackRate</em> = <em>positionState</em>.playbackRate;
</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A floating-point value specifying a multiplier corresponding to the current relative
  rate at which the media being performed is playing. A value of 1.0 indicates the media
  is playing forward at normal speed, while higher values indicate that the media is being
  played faster than normal. Lower values indicate the media is being played more slowly.
  Negative values can be specified to indicate the media is playing in reverse, with
  decreasing values then indicating faster and faster reverse playback.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> A value of 0.0 is not permitted.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>In this example, an app is updating the browser to let it know that the user has
  clicked a button causing the playback to shift to a double-speed mode. It begins by
  creating a {{domxref("MediaPositionState")}} object, then submits it to the browser it
  by calling {{domxref("MediaSession.setPositionState",
  "navigator.mediaSession.setPositionState()")}}.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">let positionState = {
  duration: myMediaDuration;
  playbackRate: 2.0;
  position: myMediaPosition;
};

navigator.mediaSession.setPositionState(positionState);
</pre>

<p>Note the value 2.0 as the <code>playbackRate</code>.</p>
