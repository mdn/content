The **`PaymentRequestUpdateEvent`** interface is used for events sent to a {{domxref("PaymentRequest")}} instance when changes are made to shipping-related information for a pending {{domxref("PaymentRequest")}}. Those events are:

- {{domxref("PaymentRequest.shippingaddresschange_event", "shippingaddresschange")}} {{securecontext_inline}}
  - : Dispatched whenever the user changes their shipping address.
    Also available using the {{domxref("PaymentRequest.onshippingaddresschange", "onshippingaddresschange")}} event handler property.
- {{domxref("PaymentRequest.shippingoptionchange_event", "shippingoptionchange")}} {{securecontext_inline}}
  - : Dispatched whenever the user changes a shipping option.
    Also available using the {{domxref("PaymentRequest.onshippingoptionchange", "onshippingoptionchange")}} event handler property.

## Constructor

- {{domxref("PaymentRequestUpdateEvent.PaymentRequestUpdateEvent()","PaymentRequestUpdateEvent()")}} {{securecontext_inline}}
  - : Creates a new `PaymentRequestUpdateEvent` object.

## Properties

## Methods
