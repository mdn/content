{{ APIRef("Pointer Events") }}

The **`pointerType`** read-only property of the
{{domxref("PointerEvent")}} interface indicates the device type (mouse, pen, or touch)
that caused a given pointer event.

## Value

The event's pointer type. The supported values are the following strings:

- `"mouse"`
  - : The event was generated by a mouse device.
- `"pen"`
  - : The event was generated by a pen or stylus device.
- `"touch"`
  - : The event was generated by a touch, such as a finger.

If the device type cannot be detected by the browser, the value can be an empty string
(`""`). If the browser supports pointer device types other than those listed
above, the value should be _vendor-prefixed_ to avoid conflicting names for
different types of devices.

## Examples

This example illustrates using the value of the `pointerType` property to
call the appropriate pointer type processing function.

```js
targetElement.addEventListener(
  "pointerdown",
  (event) => {
    // Call the appropriate pointer type handler
    switch (event.pointerType) {
      case "mouse":
        process_pointer_mouse(event);
        break;
      case "pen":
        process_pointer_pen(event);
        break;
      case "touch":
        process_pointer_touch(event);
        break;
      default:
        console.log(`pointerType ${event.pointerType} is not supported`);
    }
  },
  false,
);
```
