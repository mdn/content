<div>{{ APIRef("Pointer Events") }}</div>

<p>The <strong><code>isPrimary</code></strong> read-only property of the
  {{domxref("PointerEvent")}} interface indicates whether or not the pointer device that
  created the event is the <em>primary</em> pointer. It returns <code>true</code> if the
  pointer that caused the event to be fired is the primary device and returns
  <code>false</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>In a multi-pointer scenario (such as a touch screen that supports more than one touch
  point), this property is used to identify a <em>master pointer</em> among the set of
  active pointers for each pointer type. Only a primary pointer will produce
  <em>compatibility mouse events</em>. Authors who desire only single-pointer interaction
  can achieve that by ignoring non-primary pointers.</p>

<p>A pointer is considered primary if the pointer represents a mouse device. A pointer
  representing pen input is considered the primary pen input if its
  {{event("pointerdown")}} event was dispatched when no other active pointers representing
  pen input existed. A pointer representing touch input is considered the primary touch
  input if its {{event("pointerdown")}} event was dispatched when no other active pointers
  representing touch input existed.</p>

<p>When two or more pointer device types are being used concurrently, multiple pointers
  (one for each {{domxref("PointerEvent.pointerType", "pointerType")}}) are considered
  primary. For example, a touch contact and a mouse cursor moved simultaneously will
  produce pointers that are both considered primary. If there are multiple primary
  pointers, these pointers will all produce <em>compatibility mouse events</em> (see
  {{domxref("Pointer_events")}} for more information about pointer, mouse and touch
  interaction).</p>

<p>This example illustrates using the value of <code>isPrimary</code> to call the
  appropriate processing function.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">target.addEventListener('pointerdown', function(event) {
  if (event.isPrimary)
    process_primary_pointer(event);
  else
    process_secondary_pointer(event);
}, false);
</pre>
