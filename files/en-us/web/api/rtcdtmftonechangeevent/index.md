{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}

The **`RTCDTMFToneChangeEvent`** interface represents events sent to indicate that {{Glossary("DTMF")}} tones have started or finished playing. This interface is used by the {{event("tonechange")}} event.

## Properties

_In addition to the properties of {{domxref("Event")}}, this interface offers the following:_

- {{domxref("RTCDTMFToneChangeEvent.tone")}} {{readOnlyInline}}
  - : A {{domxref("DOMString")}} specifying the tone which has begun playing, or an empty string (`""`) if the previous tone has finished playing.

## Constructors

- {{domxref("RTCDTMFToneChangeEvent.RTCDTMFToneChangeEvent()", "RTCDTMFToneChangeEvent()")}}
  - : Returns a new `RTCDTMFToneChangeEvent`. It takes two parameters, the first being a {{domxref("DOMString")}} representing the type of the event (always `"tonechange"`); the second a dictionary containing the initial state of the properties of the event.

## Methods

_Supports the methods defined in {{domxref("Event")}}. There are no additional methods._

## Examples

This snippet is derived loosely from the full, working example you'll find in {{SectionOnPage("/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Using_DTMF", "When a tone finishes playing")}}. It appends each tone to a display box as it's played, and, once all tones have been sent, re-enabled a previously-disabled "Send" button, allowing the next DMTF string to be entered.

```js
dtmfSender.addEventListener("change", function(event) {
  if (event.tone !== "") {
    dialStringBox.innerText += event.tone;
  } else {
    sendDTMFButton.disabled = false;
  }
}, false);
```
