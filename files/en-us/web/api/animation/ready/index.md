{{ SeeCompatTable() }}{{ APIRef("Web Animations") }}

The read-only **`Animation.ready`**Â property of the [Web Animations API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}} which resolves when the animation is ready to play. A new promise is created every time the animation enters the `"pending"` [play state](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Animation/playState) as well as when the animation is canceled, since in both of those scenarios, the animation is ready to be started again.

> **Note:** Since the same {{jsxref("Promise")}} is used for both pending `play` and pending `pause` requests, authors are advised to check the state of the animation when the promise is resolved.

## Syntax

```js
var readyPromise = Animation.ready;
```

### Value

A {{jsxref("Promise")}} which resolves when the animation is ready to be played. You'll typically use a construct similar to this when using the ready promise:

```js
animation.ready.then(function() {
  // Do whatever needs to be done when
  // the animation is ready to run
});
```

## Example

In the following example, the state of the animation will be `running` when the **current ready Promise** is resolved because the animation does not leave the `pending` play state in between the calls to `pause` and `play` and hence the **current ready Promise** does not change.

```js
animation.pause();
animation.ready.then(function() {
  // Displays 'running'
  alert(animation.playState);
});
animation.play();
```
