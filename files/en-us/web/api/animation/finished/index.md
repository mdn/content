{{ APIRef("Web Animations") }}

The **`Animation.finished`** read-only property of the [Web Animations API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}} which resolves once the animation has finished playing.

> **Note:** Every time the animation leaves the `finished` play state (that is, when it starts playing again), a new `Promise` is created for this property. The new `Promise` will resolve once the new animation sequence has completed.

## Value

A {{jsxref("Promise")}} object which will resolve once the animation has finished running.

## Examples

The following code waits until all animations running on the element `elem` have finished, then deletes the element from the DOM tree:

```js
Promise.all(
  elem.getAnimations().map((animation) => animation.finished),
).then(() => elem.remove());
```
