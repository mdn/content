{{ APIRef("Web Animations") }}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`play()`** method of the [Web Animations API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API)'s {{ domxref("Animation") }} Interface starts or resumes playing of an animation. If the animation is finished, calling `play()` restarts the animation, playing it from the beginning.

## Syntax

```js
animation.play();
```

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

{{jsxref("undefined")}}

## Example

In the [Growing/Shrinking Alice Game](http://codepen.io/rachelnabors/pen/PNYGZQ?editors=0010) example, clicking or tapping the cake causes Alice's growing animation (`aliceChange`) to play forward, causing her to get bigger, as well as triggering the cake's animation. Two `Animation.play()`s, one `EventListener`:

```js
// The cake has its own animation:
var nommingCake = document.getElementById('eat-me_sprite').animate(
[
  { transform: 'translateY(0)' },
  { transform: 'translateY(-80%)' }
], {
  fill: 'forwards',
  easing: 'steps(4, end)',
  duration: aliceChange.effect.timing.duration / 2
});

// Pause the cake's animation so it doesn't play immediately.
nommingCake.pause();

// This function will play when ever a user clicks or taps
var growAlice = function() {

  // Play Alice's animation.
  aliceChange.play();

  // Play the cake's animation.
  nommingCake.play();

}

// When a user holds their mouse down or taps, call growAlice to make all the animations play.
cake.addEventListener("mousedown", growAlice, false);
cake.addEventListener("touchstart", growAlice, false);
```
