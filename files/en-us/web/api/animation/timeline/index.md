{{ SeeCompatTable() }}{{ APIRef("Web Animations") }}

The **`Animation.timeline`** property of the {{domxref("Animation")}} interface returns or sets the {{domxref("AnimationTimeline", "timeline")}} associated with this animation. A timeline is a source of time values for synchronization purposes, and is an {{domxref("AnimationTimeline")}}-based object. By default, the animation's timeline and the {{domxref("Document")}}'s timeline are the same.

## Syntax

```js
var animationsTimeline = Animation.timeline;

Animation.timeline = newTimeline;
```

### Value

AÂ {{domxref("AnimationTimeline", "timeline object", "", 1)}} to use as the timing source for the animation, or `null` to use the default, which is the {{domxref("Document")}}'s timeline.

## Examples

Here we set the animation's timeline to be the same as the document's timeline (this is the default timeline for all animations, by the way):

```js
animation.timeline = document.timeline;
```
