{{APIRef("Screen Wake Lock API")}}{{SecureContext_Header}}

The **`request()`** method of the {{domxref("WakeLock")}} interface returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}} that fullfills with a {{domxref("WakeLockSentinel")}} object if the system screen wake lock is granted.

The screen wake lock prevents device screens from dimming or locking when an application needs to keep running.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
request(type)
```

### Parameters

- `type` {{optional_inline}}

  - : A string specifying the screen wake lock type, from among the following enumerated types:

    - `screen`
      - : Prevents the screen from turning off.
        Only visible documents can acquire the screen wake lock.

If no `type` parameter is explicitly specified, the `request()` method defaults to using the `screen` type.

### Return value

A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves with a {{domxref("WakeLockSentinel")}} object.

### Exceptions

- `NotAllowedError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}

  - : Thrown when wake lock is not available, which can happen because:

    - Use of this feature is blocked by a [Permissions Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy).
    - The document is not fully active.
    - The document's visibility state is `hidden`.
    - The {{Glossary("User Agent")}} could not acquire platform's wake lock.
      For example, this might happen if the device is low on battery.

## Examples

The following asynchronous function requests a {{domxref("WakeLockSentinel")}} object.
The `request()` method is wrapped in a `try...catch` statement to handle cases where the browser refuses the request for any reason.

```js
const requestWakeLock = async () => {
  try {
    const wakeLock = await navigator.wakeLock.request("screen");
  } catch (err) {
    // The wake lock request fails - usually system-related, such as low battery.

    console.log(`${err.name}, ${err.message}`);
  }
};

requestWakeLock();
```

The screen wake lock may be revoked by the device after it has been granted.
The returned {{domxref("WakeLockSentinel")}} can be used to check the status of the lock, and/or to manually cancel a held screen wake lock.
