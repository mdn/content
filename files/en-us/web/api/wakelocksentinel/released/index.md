{{APIRef("Screen Wake Lock API")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The read-only **`released`** property of the
{{domxref("WakeLockSentinel")}} interface returns a boolean that indicates whether
a {{domxref("WakeLockSentinel")}} has been released yet.

## Syntax

```js
const released = sentinel.released;
```

### Value

A boolean value, that is `false` until the
{{domxref("WakeLockSentinel")}} has been released (either through a call to
{{domxref("WakeLockSentinel.release()")}} or because the lock has been released
automatically) and the {{domxref("WakeLockSentinel/release_event", "release")}} event has been
emitted, after which it becomes `true` and no longer changes.

## Examples

This example shows how **`released`**'s value changes within a
{{domxref("WakeLockSentinel")}}'s life cycle.

```js
const sentinel = await navigator.wakeLock.request('screen');
console.log(sentinel.released);  // Logs "false"

sentinel.onrelease = () => {
  console.log(sentinel.released);  // Logs "true"
};

await sentinel.release();
```
