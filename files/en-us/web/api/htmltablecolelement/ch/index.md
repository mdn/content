{{APIRef("HTML DOM")}}{{deprecated_header}}

The **`ch`** property of the {{domxref("HTMLTableColElement")}} interface does nothing. It reflects the `char` attribute of the {{HTMLElement("col")}} element.

> **Note:** This property was designed to participate to the ability to align table cell content on a specific character (typically the decimal point), but was never implemented by browsers.
>
> To achieve such alignment, watch for the support of a string value with the {{cssxref("text-align")}} CSS property.

## Value
