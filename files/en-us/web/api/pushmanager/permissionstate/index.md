{{ApiRef("Push API")}}

The **`permissionState()`** method of the
{{domxref("PushManager")}} interface returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves to a
string indicating the permission state of the push manager. Possible
values are  `'prompt'`, `'denied'`, or `'granted'`.

> **Note:** As of Firefox 44, the permissions for [Notifications](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API) and [Push](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API) have been merged. If permission is
> granted for notifications, push will also be enabled.

## Syntax

```js
permissionState()
permissionState(options)
```

### Parameters

- `options` {{optional_inline}}

  - : An object containing optional configuration parameters. It can have the following
    properties:

    - `userVisibleOnly`
      - : A boolean indicating that the returned push
        subscription will only be used for messages whose effect is made visible to the
        user.
    - `applicationServerKey`
      - : A public key your push server will use to
        send messages to client apps via a push server. This value is part of a signing
        key pair generated by your application server and usable with elliptic curve
        digital signature (ECDSA) over the P-256 curve.

### Return value

A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves to a string with a value of
`'prompt'`, `'denied'`, or `'granted'`.
