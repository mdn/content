{{APIRef("Web Components")}}

The **`ariaCurrent`** property of the {{domxref("ElementInternals")}} interface reflects the value of the [`aria-current`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-current) attribute, which indicates the element that represents the current item within a container or set of related elements.

> [!NOTE]
> Setting aria attributes on `ElementInternals` allows default semantics to be defined on a custom element. These may be overwritten by author-defined attributes, but ensure that default semantics are retained should the author delete those attributes, or fail to add them at all. For more information see the [Accessibility Object Model explainer](https://wicg.github.io/aom/explainer.html#default-semantics-for-custom-elements-via-the-elementinternals-object).

- `"page"`
  - : Represents the current page within a set of pages.

- `"date"`
