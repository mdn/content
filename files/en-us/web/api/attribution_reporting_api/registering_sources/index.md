This article explains how to register attribution sources when using the [Attribution Reporting API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API).

## Basic methodology

Attribution sources take the form of links, images, or scripts contained within content that you want to measure interactions with (for example, they might be ads that you want to measure conversions on). These cause the browser to store source data in a private local cache (accessible only by the browser) when specific user interactions occur. The different attribution source types are registered and signal interactions in different ways — they are differentiated as:

- Navigation sources, which cause the browser to store source data in response to navigation — for example when the user clicks on a link or activates it with the keyboard, or when a navigation occurs as a result of a {{domxref("Window.open()")}} call. See [Navigation-based attribution sources](#navigation-based_attribution_sources) for examples.
- Event sources, which cause the browser to store source data in response to events firing. See [Event-based attribution sources](#event-based_attribution_sources) for examples.

What happens behind the scenes to register sources and retrieve and store the source data is the same in both cases:

1. When the user interacts with an attribution source, it sends an {{httpheader("Attribution-Reporting-Eligible")}} header on a request to the server measuring the interactions (typically the advertiser's server), which indicates that the response is eligible to register a source. For example:

   ```http
   Attribution-Reporting-Eligible: navigation-source
   ```

2. When the server receives a request that includes an `Attribution-Reporting-Eligible` header, it can include an {{httpheader("Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source")}} header along with the response to complete source registration. Its value is a JSON string that provides the information the browser should store about the attribution source that was interacted with. The information included in this header also determines which types of report the browser will generate:

   - The following example will cause an [event-level report](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API/Generating_reports#event-level_reports) to be generated when a [trigger](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API/Registering_triggers) is matched to a source:

     ```js
     res.set(
       "Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source",
       JSON.stringify({
         source_event_id: "412444888111012",
         destination: "https://advertiser.example",
         trigger_data: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
         trigger_data_matching: "exact",
         expiry: "604800",
         priority: "100",
         debug_key: "122939999",
         event_report_window: "86400",
       }),
     );
     ```

     The only required field in this context is `destination`, which specifies 1–3 sites on which a trigger is expected to occur. These are used to match the attribution trigger to the source when a trigger is interacted with. The other fields specified above do the following:

     - `"source_event_id"`: A string representing an ID for the attribution source, which can be used to map it to other information when the attribution source is interacted with, or aggregate information at the reporting endpoint (see [Generating reports > Basic process](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API/Generating_reports#basic_process) for endpoint information).
     - `"trigger_data"`: An array of 32-bit unsigned integers representing data that describes the different trigger events that could match this source. For example, "user added item to shopping cart" or "user signed up to mailing list" could be actions happening at the trigger site that could match this source and indicate a conversion of some kind that the advertiser is trying to measure. These must be matched against `"trigger_data"` specified in [triggers](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Attribution-Reporting-Register-Trigger#trigger_data) for event-level attribution to take place.
       > **Note:** The values used to represent each event, and the number of elements in the array, are completely arbitrary and defined by you as the developer. The array may contain values that are not used, but values must be present in the array to be attributed to the source by the browser when a trigger is registered.
     - `"trigger_data_matching"`: A string that specifies how the `"trigger_data"` from the trigger is matched against the source's `"trigger_data"`. `"exact"` is the value you'll nearly always use, which matches exact values.
     - `"expiry"`: A string representing an expiry time in seconds for the attribution source, after which it will no longer be active (i.e. subsequent triggers won't be attributable to this source).
     - `"priority"`: A string representing a priority value for the attribution source. See [Report priorities and limits](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API/Generating_reports#report_priorities_and_limits) for more information.
     - `"debug_key"`: A base-10-formatted 64-bit unsigned integer representing a debug key. Set this if you want to generate a [debug report](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API/Generating_reports#debug_reports) alongside the associated attribution report.
     - `"event_report_window"`: A string representing a time in seconds, after which subsequent triggers won't be attributable to this source for the purpose of producing event-level reports.

     See {{httpheader("Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source")}} for a detailed description of all the fields available on this header.

   - To make the browser generate a [summary report](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Attribution_Reporting_API/Generating_reports#summary_reports) when a trigger is matched to a source, you need to include some extra fields, _in addition_ to those required for generating an event-level report.

     ```js
     res.set(
       "Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source",
       JSON.stringify({
         source_event_id: "412444888111012",
         destination: "https://advertiser.example",
         trigger_data: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
         trigger_data_matching: "exact",
         expiry: "604800",
         priority: "100",
         debug_key: "122939999",
         event_report_window: "86400",

         aggregation_keys: {
           campaignCounts: "0x159",
           geoValue: "0x5",
         },
         aggregatable_report_window: "86400",
       }),
     );
     ```

     The additional fields in this example are:

     - `"aggregation_keys"`: An object containing user-provided keys representing different data points to aggregate report values under.
     - `"aggregatable_report_window"`: A string representing a time in seconds after which trigger data will no longer be included in generated aggregatable reports.

     Again, see {{httpheader("Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source")}} for a detailed description of all the fields available on this header.

3. After a successful source registration occurs, the browser stores the provided source data in its private local cache.

## Navigation-based attribution sources

Navigation sources are useful for measuring interactions with links — for example, a user may see an ad on a publisher's page, and click it to navigate to the advertiser's page where a conversion will hopefully occur.

There are a couple of different types of navigation-based attribution sources (for example, clicking on an ad) that can be registered — those based on HTML (which use the `attributionsrc` attribute) and those based on {{domxref("Window.open()")}} calls (which use an `attributionsrc` window feature).

### HTML-based navigation sources

To register a navigation-based attribution source you can add the `attributionsrc` attribute to an appropriate {{htmlelement("a")}} element, which specifies where the registration request will be sent.

If you leave the attribute value blank, the registration request will be sent to the location being linked to. It is also possible to specify one or more additional URLs inside the value to send the registration request to; see the [Specifying URLs inside attributionsrc](#specifying_urls_inside_attributionsrc) for more details.

`attributionsrc` can be added declaratively:

```html
<a href="https://shop.example" attributionsrc target="_blank">
  Click to visit our shop
</a>
```

Or via the {{domxref("HTMLAnchorElement.attributionSrc")}} property:

```js
const aElem = document.querySelector("a");
aElem.attributionSrc = "";
```

In this case, the interaction occurs, causing the browser to store the source data associated with the navigation-based attribution source (as provided in the {{httpheader("Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source")}} response header) when the user clicks the link and the browser receives the response.

### Window.open()-based navigation sources

You can also add the `attributionsrc` feature keyword to the features property of a {{domxref("Window.open()")}} call. In this example we run it in response to a `click` event being fired:

```js
elem.addEventListener("click", () => {
  window.open("https://shop.example", "_blank", "attributionsrc");
});
```

In this case, the interaction occurs and the browser stores the source data when `Window.open()` is invoked, and the browser receives the response.

> **Note:** When setting up a [`click`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/click_event) event like in the above example, it is advisable to set it on a control where a click is expected, such as a {{htmlelement("button")}} or {{htmlelement("a")}} element. This makes more sense semantically, and is more accessible to both screenreader and keyboard users.

> **Note:** To register an attribution source via `open()`, it must be called with [transient activation](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Transient_activation) (i.e. inside a user interaction event handler such as `click`) within five seconds of user interaction.

## Event-based attribution sources

Event-based attribution sources cause the browser to store source data in response to some kind of event firing, such as the `load` event in the case of an `<img>` or `<script>` element (which use the `attributionsrc` attribute like we saw above with the `<a>` element), or a custom event of your choice set in your JavaScript.

### HTML-based event sources

HTML-based event sources can be used for measuring interactions with a publisher's page when it first loads — or more precisely when an `<img>` or `<script>` loads. To register an event-based attribution source via HTML, you can add the `attributionsrc` attribute to an appropriate element — {{htmlelement("img")}} or {{htmlelement("script")}}.

If you leave the attribute value blank, the registration request will be sent to the server the requested resource is hosted on. It is also possible to specify one or more additional URLs inside the value to send the registration request to; see [Specifying URLs inside attributionsrc](#specifying_urls_inside_attributionsrc) for more details.

Let's look at an `<img>` element example:

```html
<img src="advertising-image.png" attributionsrc />
```

You could also achieve this via the {{domxref("HTMLImageElement.attributionSrc")}} property:

```js
const imgElem = document.querySelector("img");
imgElem.attributionSrc = "";
```

The browser stores the attribution source data when the browser receives the response containing the image file (i.e. when the `load` event occurs). Bear in mind that users might not necessarily be able to perceive the image at all — it might be a 1x1 transparent tracking pixel that is only being used for attribution reporting.

A {{htmlelement("script")}} example might look like so:

```html
<script src="advertising-script.js" attributionsrc />
```

Or via the {{domxref("HTMLScriptElement.attributionSrc")}} property:

```js
const scriptElem = document.querySelector("script");
scriptElem.attributionSrc = "";
```

In this case, the interaction occurs and the browser stores the source data when the browser receives the response containing the script.

### JavaScript-based event sources

Script-based attribution sources are more versatile than HTML-based attribution sources. You can set up a script to initiate a request that is eligible to register an attribution source based on whatever request suits your app. This is a flexible approach, useful when you want to store source data in response to custom interactions, for example, clicking a custom element or submitting a form.

To set up a script-based attribution source, you can either:

- Send a {{domxref("fetch()")}} request containing the `attributionReporting` option:

  ```js
  const attributionReporting = {
    eventSourceEligible: true,
    triggerEligible: false,
  };

  // Optionally set keepalive to ensure the request outlives the page
  function triggerSourceInteraction() {
    fetch("https://shop.example/endpoint", {
      keepalive: true,
      attributionReporting,
    });
  }

  // Associate the interaction trigger with whatever
  // event makes sense for your code (does not have to be a
  // DOM event/user interaction)
  elem.addEventListener("click", triggerSourceInteraction);
  ```

- Send an {{domxref("XMLHttpRequest")}} with {{domxref("XMLHttpRequest.setAttributionReporting", "setAttributionReporting()")}} invoked on the request object:

  ```js
  const attributionReporting = {
    eventSourceEligible: true,
    triggerEligible: false,
  };

  function triggerSourceInteraction() {
    const req = new XMLHttpRequest();
    req.open("GET", "https://shop.example/endpoint");
    // Check availability of setAttributionReporting() before calling
    if (typeof req.setAttributionReporting === "function") {
      req.setAttributionReporting(attributionReporting);
      req.send();
    } else {
      throw new Error("Attribution reporting not available");
      // Include recovery code here as appropriate
    }
  }

  // Associate the interaction trigger with whatever
  // event makes sense for your code (does not have to be a
  // DOM event/user interaction)
  elem.addEventListener("click", triggerSourceInteraction);
  ```

In this case, the interaction occurs and the browser stores the source data when the browser receives the response from the fetch request.

> **Note:** The request can be for any resource. It doesn't need to have anything directly to do with the Attribution Reporting API, and can be a request for JSON, plain text, an image blob, or whatever else makes sense for your app.

## Specifying URLs inside attributionsrc

So far, in all the examples we have seen, the `attributionsrc` attribute/feature or `attributionSrc` property has been left blank, taking the value of an empty string. This is fine if the server that holds the requested resource is the same server that you also want to handle the registration, i.e. receive the {{httpheader("Attribution-Reporting-Eligible")}} header and respond with the {{httpheader("Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source")}} header.

However, it might be that the requested resource is not on a server you control, or you just want to handle registering the attribution source on a different server. In such cases, you can specify one or more URLs as the value of `attributionsrc`. When the resource request occurs, the {{httpheader("Attribution-Reporting-Eligible")}} header will be sent to the URL(s) specified in `attributionsrc` in addition to the resource origin; these URLs can then respond with the {{httpheader("Attribution-Reporting-Register-Source")}} to register the source.

For example, in the case of an `<a>` element you could declare the URL(s) in the `attributionsrc` attribute:

```html
<a
  href="https://shop.example"
  attributionsrc="https://a.example/register-source">
  Click to visit our shop
</a>
```

Or in JavaScript via the `attributionSrc` property:

```js
// encode the URLs in case they contain special characters
// such as '=' that would be improperly parsed.
const encodedUrlA = encodeURIComponent("https://a.example/register-source");
const encodedUrlB = encodeURIComponent("https://b.example/register-source");

const aElem = document.querySelector("a");
aElem.attributionSrc = `${encodedUrlA} ${encodedUrlB}`;
```

In the case of a {{domxref("Window.open()")}} call, the different URLs would have to be listed as multiple separate `attributionsrc` features in the [`windowFeatures`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open#windowfeatures) parameter, separated by commas or whitespace:

```js
// encode the URLs in case they contain special characters
// such as '=' that would be improperly parsed.
const encodedUrlA = encodeURIComponent("https://a.example/register-source");
const encodedUrlB = encodeURIComponent("https://b.example/register-source");

elem.addEventListener("click", () => {
  window.open(
    "https://ourshop.example",
    "_blank",
    `attributionsrc=${encodedUrlA},attributionsrc=${encodedUrlB}`,
  );
});
```

> **Note:** Specifying multiple URLs means that multiple attribution sources can be registered on the same feature. You might for example have different campaigns that you are trying to measure the success of, which involve generating different reports on different data.
