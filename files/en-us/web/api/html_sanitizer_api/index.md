The **HTML Sanitizer API** allow developers to take untrusted strings of HTML and {{domxref('Document')}} or {{domxref('DocumentFragment')}} objects, and sanitize them for safe insertion into a documentâ€™s DOM.

## Concepts and usage

Web applications often need to work with untrusted HTML on the client side, for example, as part of a client-side templating solution or for rendering user generated content, or when including data in a frame from other another site.
The Sanitizer API allows for rendering of this potentially untrusted HTML in a safe manner.

To access the API you would use the {{domxref('Sanitizer.Sanitizer()','Sanitizer()')}} constructor to create and configure a {{domxref('Sanitizer')}} instance.
The configuration options parameter allows you to specify the allowed and dis-allowed elements and attributes, and to enable custom elements and comments.

The most common use-case - preventing XSS - is handled by the default configuration.
Creating a {{domxref('Sanitizer.Sanitizer')}} with a custom configuration is necessary only to handle additional, application-specific use cases.

The API has three main methods for sanitizing data.
- {{domxref('Element.setHTML()')}} parses and sanitizes a string of HTML and immediately inserts it into the DOM as a child of the current element.
  This is essentially "safe" version of {{domxref('Element.innerHTML')}}, and should be used instead of `innerHTML` when inserting untrusted data.
- {{domxref('Sanitizer.sanitizeFor()')}} parses and sanitizes a string of HTML for later insertion into the DOM.
  This might be used when the target element for the string is not always ready/available for update.
- {{domxref('Sanitizer.sanitize()')}} sanitizes data that is in a {{domxref('Document')}} or {{domxref('DocumentFragment')}}.
  It might be used, for example, to sanitize a {{domxref('Document')}} instance in a frame.


### Parsing and sanitizing strings

The result of parsing a string of HTML depends on the context/the element into which it is inserted.

For example, an HTML string containing {{HTMLElement("td")}} elements is valid if inserted under a {{HTMLElement("table")}} elements, but will be dropped if inserted in a {{HTMLElement("div")}} element.
Similarly, an {{HTMLElement("em")}} element is a valid node in a {{HTMLElement("div")}} but the tag will be escaped if used in a {{HTMLElement("textarea")}}:

```html
<!-- "<em>bla</em>" inserted into <div> -->
<div><em>bla</em></div>

<!-- "<em>bla</em>" inserted into <textarea> -->
<textarea>&lt;em&gt;bla</textarea>
```

The target element must therefore be known when the parser is run and the resulting subtree must be inserted into that same type of element in the DOM, or the result will be incorrect.

For this reason when using {{domxref('Sanitizer.sanitizeFor()')}} developers must specify the tag of the eventual target element as a parameter, and the method returns a matching HTML element with the parsed string as a child (for example, the target tag `"div"` results in a returned object that is an instance of {{domxref("HTMLDivElement")}}).
The return type ensures that a user always has the context in which the object must be inserted into the DOM.

This consideration does not matter for {{domxref('Element.setHTML()')}} as it is called on a particular element and the context is therefore implicit.

The parser may also perform normalization operations on the input string.
As a result, even if the HTML is valid and the sanitizer method does nothing, the sanitized output may not precisely match the unsanitized input.
This applies to both methods.


## Interfaces

- {{domxref('Sanitizer')}}
  - : Provides the functionality to define a sanitizer configuration, to sanitize untrusted strings of HTML for later insertion into the DOM, and to sanitize {{domxref('Document')}} and {{domxref('DocumentFragment')}} objects.
- {{domxref('Element/setHTML','Element.setHTML()')}}
  - : Parses a string of HTML into a subtree of nodes, sanitizes it using a `Sanitizer` object, then sets it as a child of the current element.


## Examples

The following examples show how to use the sanitizer API using the _default_ sanitizer (at time of writing configuration operations are not yet supported).

### Sanitize a string immediately

The code below demonstrates how {{domxref('Element/setHTML','Element.setHTML()')}} is used to sanitize a string of HTML and insert it into the `Element` with an id of `target`.

The `script` element is disallowed by the default sanitizer so the alert is removed.

```js
const unsanitized_string = "abc <script>alert(1)</script> def";  // Unsanitized string of HTML

const sanitizer = new Sanitizer();  // Default sanitizer;

// Get the Element with id "target" and set it with the sanitized string.
const target = document.getElementById("target");
target.setHTML(unsanitized_string, sanitizer);

console.log(target.innerHTML);
// "abc  def"
```

### Sanitize a string for deferred use

The example below shows the same sanitization operation using the {{domxref("Sanitizer.sanitizeFor()")}} method, with the intent of later inserting the returned element into a `<div>` element:

```js
const unsanitized_string = "abc <script>alert(1)</script> def";  // Unsanitized string of HTML
const sanitizer = new Sanitizer();  // Default sanitizer;

// Sanitize the string
let sanitizedDiv = sanitizer.sanitizeFor("div", unsanitized_string);

//We can verify the returned element type, and view sanitized HTML in string form:
console.log( (sanitizedDiv instanceof HTMLDivElement) );
// true
console.log(sanitizedDiv.innerHTML)
// "abc  def"

// At some point later ...

// Get the element to update. This must be a div to match our sanitizeFor() context.
// Set its content to be the children of our sanitized element. 
document.querySelector("div#target").replaceChildren(sanitizedDiv.children);
```

> **Note:** If you really must perform a string-to-string operation you can extract the string using `innerHTML`,
> but you must remember to use the correct context when the string is applied:
>
> ```js
> const unsanitized_string = "abc <script>alert(1)</script> def"; 
> let sanitizedString = new Sanitizer().sanitizeFor("div", unsanitized_string).innerHTML;
> ```


### Sanitize a frame

To sanitize data from an {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} with id `userFrame`:

```js
const sanitizer = new Sanitizer();  // Default sanitizer;

// Get the frame and its Document object
const frame_element = document.getElementById("userFrame")
const unsantitized_frame_tree = frame_element.contentWindow.document;

// Sanitize the document tree and update the frame.
const sanitized_frame_tree = sanitizer.sanitize(unsanititized_frame_tree);
frame_element.replaceChildren(sanitized_frame_tree);
```
