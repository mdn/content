{{APIRef("HTML DOM")}}

**`PopStateEvent`** is an interface for the [`popstate`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/popstate_event) event.

A `popstate` event is dispatched to the window every time the active history
entry changes between two history entries for the same document. If the history entry
being activated was created by a call to `history.pushState()` or was
affected by a call to `history.replaceState()`, the `popstate`
event's `state` property contains a copy of the history entry's state object.
