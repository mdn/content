{{APIRef("Web Workers API")}}

The **`onmessage`** property of the {{domxref("DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope")}} interface represents an [event handler](/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Event_handlers) to be called when the {{event("message")}} event occurs — i.e. when a message is sent to the worker using the {{domxref("Worker.postMessage")}} method.

## Syntax

    self.onmessage = function() { ... };

## Example

The following code snippet shows creation of a {{domxref("Worker")}} object using the {{domxref("Worker.Worker", "Worker()")}} constructor. Messages are passed to the worker when the value inside the form input `first` changes. A {{domxref("Worker.onmessage")}} handler is also present, to deal with messages are passed back from the worker.

```js
var myWorker = new Worker("worker.js");

first.onchange = function() {
  myWorker.postMessage([first.value, second.value]);
  console.log('Message posted to worker');
}

myWorker.onmessage = function(e) {
  result.textContent = e.data;
  console.log('Message received from worker');
}
```

In the `worker.js` script, a `DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope.onmessage` handler is used to handle messages from the main script:

```js
onmessage = function(e) {
  console.log('Message received from main script');
  var workerResult = 'Result: ' + (e.data[0] * e.data[1]);
  console.log('Posting message back to main script');
  postMessage(workerResult);
}
```

Notice how in the main script, `onmessage` has to be called on `myWorker`, whereas inside the worker script you just need `onmessage` because the worker is effectively the global scope (the {{domxref("DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope")}}, in this case).
