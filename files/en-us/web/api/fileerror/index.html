<div>{{APIRef("File System API")}}{{deprecated_header}}</div>

<p>Represents an error that occurs while using the {{domxref("FileReader")}} interface.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This interface is obsolete per the latest specification. Use the new DOM4 {{domxref("DOMError")}} interface instead.</p>
</div>

<p>In the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API/Introduction">File System API</a>, a <code>FileError</code> represents error conditions that you might encounter while accessing the file system using the asynchronous API. It extends the <code>FileError</code> interface described in <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/file-system/pub/FileSystem/#bib-FILE-WRITER">File Writer</a> and adds several new error codes.</p>

<p><code>FileError</code> objects are passed to error callbacks. The objects have a code that shows the type of error that occurred.</p>

<h2 id="Best_practices">Best practices</h2>

<p>Most people don't read the page on errors and exceptions unless they're stumped. So the following are a few tips that could help you avoid some pitfalls.</p>

<h3 id="Error_callbacks_are_not_optional_for_your_sanity">Error callbacks are not optional for your sanity</h3>

<p>Although error callbacks are optional, you should include them in the arguments of the methods for the sake of the sanity of your users. A web app could fail for various reasons, so you don't want to spend the rest of your day guessing what's going on and going through maddening troubleshooting.</p>

<h3 id="Don't_run_your_app_from_file">Don't run your app from file://</h3>

<p>For security reasons, browsers do not allow you to run your app from <code>file://</code>. In fact, many of the powerful storage APIs (such as File System, BlobBuilder, and FileReader) throw errors if you run the app locally from <code>file://</code>. When you're just testing your app, and you don't want to set up a web server, you can bypass the security restriction on Chrome. Just start Chrome with the <code>--allow-file-access-from-files</code> flag. Use the flag only for testing purposes.</p>
