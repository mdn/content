{{APIRef("File API")}}{{AvailableInWorkers}}

The **`readyState`** read-only property of the {{domxref("FileReader")}} interface provides the current state of the reading operation.
This will be one of the states: `EMPTY`, `LOADING`, or `DONE`.

## Value

A number which is one of the three possible state constants define for the {{domxref("FileReader")}} API.

- `FileReader.EMPTY`
  - : Reader has been created, but none of the read methods have been called yet.
- `FileReader.LOADING`
  - : A read method has been called. A {{domxref("File")}} or {{domxref("Blob")}} is being read, and no error has occurred yet.
- `FileReader.DONE`
  - : The read operation is complete. This could mean that: the entire {{domxref("File")}} or {{domxref("Blob")}} has been read into memory, a file read error occurred, or {{domxref("FileReader.abort()", "abort()")}} was called and the read was cancelled.

## Examples

```js
const reader = new FileReader();
console.log("EMPTY", reader.readyState); // readyState will be 0

reader.readAsText(blob);
console.log("LOADING", reader.readyState); // readyState will be 1

reader.onloadend = () => {
  console.log("DONE", reader.readyState); // readyState will be 2
};
```
