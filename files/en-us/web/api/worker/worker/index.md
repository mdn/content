{{APIRef("Web Workers API")}}{{AvailableInWorkers("window_and_worker_except_service")}}

The **`Worker()`** constructor creates a {{domxref("Worker")}} object that executes the script at the specified URL. This script must obey the [same-origin policy](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).

> [!NOTE]
> There is a disagreement among browser manufacturers about whether a data URL is of the same origin or not. Though Firefox 10 and later accept data URLs, that's not the case in all other browsers.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
new Worker(url)
new Worker(url, options)
```

### Parameters

- `url`

  - : A string representing the URL of the script the worker will execute. It must obey the same-origin policy. The URL is resolved relative to the current HTML page's location.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Bundlers, including [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/guides/web-workers/), [Vite](https://vite.dev/guide/features.html#web-workers), and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/languages/javascript/#web-workers), recommend passing URLs that are relative to [`import.meta.url`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import.meta#url) to the `Worker()` constructor. For example:
    >
    > ```js
    > const myWorker = new Worker(new URL("worker.js", import.meta.url));
    > ```
    >
    > This way, the path is relative to the current script instead of the current HTML page, which allows the bundler to safely do optimizations like renaming (because otherwise the `worker.js` URL may point to a file not controlled by the bundler, so it cannot make any assumptions).

- `options` {{optional_inline}}

  - : An object containing option properties that can be set when creating the object instance. Available properties are as follows:

    - `type`
      - : A string specifying the type of worker to create. The value can be `classic` or `module`. If not specified, the default used is `classic`.
    - `credentials`
      - : A string specifying the type of credentials to use for the worker. The value can be `omit`, `same-origin`, or _`include`. If not specified, or if type is `classic`, the default used is `same-origin` (only include credentials for same-origin requests)._
    - `name`
      - : A string specifying an identifying name for the {{domxref("DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope")}} representing the scope of the worker, which is mainly useful for debugging purposes.

### Exceptions

- `SecurityError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Thrown if the document is not allowed to start workers, e.g. if the URL has an invalid syntax or if the same-origin policy is violated.
- `NetworkError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Thrown if the MIME type of the worker script is incorrect. It _should_ always be `text/javascript`
    (for historical reasons [other JavaScript MIME types](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/MIME_types#legacy_javascript_mime_types) may be accepted).
- `SyntaxError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Thrown if _aURL_ cannot be parsed.

## Examples

The following code snippet shows creation of a {{domxref("Worker")}} object using the `Worker()` constructor and subsequent usage of the object:

```js
const myWorker = new Worker("worker.js");
const first = document.querySelector("input#number1");

first.onchange = () => {
  myWorker.postMessage(first.value);
  console.log("Message posted to worker");
};
```
