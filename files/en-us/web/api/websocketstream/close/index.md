{{APIRef("WebSockets API")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}{{AvailableInWorkers}}

The **`close()`** method of the
{{domxref("WebSocketStream")}} interface closes the WebSocket connection. The method optionally accepts an object containing a custom code and/or reason indicating why the connection was closed.

An alternative mechanism for closing a `WebSocketStream` is to specify an {{domxref("AbortSignal")}} in the [`signal`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocketStream/WebSocketStream#signal) option of the constructor upon creation. The associated {{domxref("AbortController")}} can then be used to close the WebSocket connection. This is generally the preferred mechanism. However, `close()` can be used if you wish to specify a custom code and/or reason.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
close()
close(options)
```

### Parameters

- `options` {{optional_inline}}
  - : An options object containing the following properties:
    - `closeCode` {{optional_inline}}
      - : A number representing the closing code (see the full list of [`CloseEvent` status codes](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CloseEvent/code#value)).
    - `reason` {{optional_inline}}
      - : A string representing a human-readable description of the reason why the socket connection is closed. The maximum allowed length for a `reason` string is 123 bytes. The string is automatically encoded as UTF-8 when the function is invoked.

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on the server setup and status code you use, the server may choose to ignore a custom code in favor of a valid code that is correct for the closing reason. Valid codes are 1000, and any code within the range 3000 to 4999, inclusive.

### Return value

None (`undefined`).

### Exceptions

- `SyntaxError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : Thrown if the provided `reason` is longer than the maximum allowed length of 123 bytes.

## Examples

```js
const wsURL = "wss://127.0.0.1/";
const wss = new WebSocketStream(wsURL);

setTimeout(() => {
  wss.close({
    code: 1000,
    reason: "That's all folks",
  });
}, 10000);
```
