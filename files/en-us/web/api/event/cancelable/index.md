{{ ApiRef("DOM") }}

The **_`cancelable`_**
read-only property of the {{domxref("Event")}} interface indicates whether the event
can be canceled, and therefore prevented as if the event never happened.

If the
event is _not_ cancelable, then its `cancelable` property will be
`false` and the event listener cannot stop the event from occurring.

Event listeners that handle multiple kinds of events may want to check
`cancelable` before invoking their {{domxref("event.preventDefault",
  "preventDefault()")}} methods.

Most browser-native events that can be canceled are the ones that result from the user
interacting with the page. Canceling the {{domxref("Element/click_event", "click")}},
{{domxref("Document/scroll_event", "scroll")}}, or
{{domxref("Window/beforeunload_event", "beforeunload")}} events would prevent the user
from clicking on something, scrolling the page, or navigating away from the page,
respectively.

[Custom events](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/Event) created by other JavaScript
code control if they can be canceled when they are created.

## Syntax

```js
bool = event.cancelable;
```

### Value

The result is a boolean value, which is `true` if the event can be
canceled.

## Example

For example, browser vendors are proposing that the {{domxref("Document/wheel_event",
  "wheel")}} event can only be canceled [the first time
the listener is called](https://github.com/WICG/interventions/issues/33) â€” any following `wheel` events cannot be
canceled.

```js
function preventScrollWheel(event) {
  if (typeof event.cancelable !== 'boolean' || event.cancelable) {
    // The event can be canceled, so we do so.
    event.preventDefault();
  } else {
    // The event cannot be canceled, so it is not safe
    // to call preventDefault() on it.
    console.warn(`The following event couldn't be canceled:`);
    console.dir(event);
  }
}

document.addEventListener('wheel', preventScrollWheel);
```

## Notes

Whether an event can be canceled or not is something that's determined when that event
is initialized.

To cancel an event, call the {{domxref("event.preventDefault", "preventDefault()")}}
method on the event. This keeps the implementation from executing the default action
that is associated with the event.
