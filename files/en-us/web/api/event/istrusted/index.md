{{APIRef("DOM")}}{{AvailableInWorkers}}

The **`isTrusted`** read-only property of the
{{domxref("Event")}} interface is a boolean value that is `true`
when the event was generated by the user agent (including via user actions and programmatic methods such as {{domxref("HTMLElement.focus()")}}),
and `false` when the event was dispatched via
{{domxref("EventTarget.dispatchEvent()")}}.
The only exception is the `click` event, which initializes the `isTrusted`
property to `false` in user agents.

## Value

A boolean value.

## Example

```js
if (e.isTrusted) {
  /* The event is trusted */
} else {
  /* The event is not trusted */
}
```
