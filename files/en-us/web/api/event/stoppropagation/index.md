{{APIRef("DOM")}}

The **`stopPropagation()`** method of the {{domxref("Event")}}
interface prevents further propagation of the current event in the capturing and
bubbling phases. It does not, however, prevent any default behaviors from occurring; for
instance, clicks on links are still processed. If you want to stop those behaviors, see
theÂ {{domxref("Event.preventDefault", "preventDefault()")}} method.

## Syntax

```js
event.stopPropagation();
```

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

`undefined`.

## Examples

See Example 5: [Event
Propagation](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Examples#example_5_event_propagation) in the Examples chapter for a more detailed example of this method and
event propagation in the DOM.
