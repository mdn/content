{{ APIRef("Web Audio API") }}

The `AudioListener` interface represents the position and orientation of the unique person listening to the audio scene, and is used in [audio spatialization](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Web_audio_spatialization_basics). All {{domxref("PannerNode")}}s spatialize in relation to the `AudioListener` stored in the {{domxref("BaseAudioContext.listener")}} attribute.

It is important to note that there is only one listener per context and that it isn't an {{domxref("AudioNode")}}.

## Properties

> **Note:** The position, forward, and up value are set and retrieved using different syntaxes. Retrieval is done by accessing, for example, `AudioListener.positionX`, while setting the same property is done with `AudioListener.positionX.value`. This is why these values are not marked read only, which is how they appear in the specification's IDL.

- {{domxref("AudioListener.positionX")}}
  - : Represents the horizontal position of the listener in a right-hand cartesian coordinate system. The default is 0.
- {{domxref("AudioListener.positionY")}}
  - : Represents the vertical position of the listener in a right-hand cartesian coordinate system. The default is 0.
- {{domxref("AudioListener.positionZ")}}
  - : Represents the longitudinal (back and forth) position of the listener in a right-hand cartesian coordinate system. The default is 0.
- {{domxref("AudioListener.forwardX")}}
  - : Represents the horizontal position of the listener's forward direction in the same cartesian coordinate system as the position (`positionX`, `positionY`, and `positionZ`) values. The forward and up values are linearly independent of each other. The default is 0.
- {{domxref("AudioListener.forwardY")}}
  - : Represents the vertical position of the listener's forward direction in the same cartesian coordinate system as the position (`positionX`, `positionY`, and `positionZ`) values. The forward and up values are linearly independent of each other. The default is 0.
- {{domxref("AudioListener.forwardZ")}}
  - : Represents the longitudinal (back and forth) position of the listener's forward direction in the same cartesian coordinate system as the position (`positionX`, `positionY`, and `positionZ`) values. The forward and up values are linearly independent of each other. The default is -1.
- {{domxref("AudioListener.upX")}}
  - : Represents the horizontal position of the top of the listener's head in the same cartesian coordinate system as the position (`positionX`, `positionY`, and `positionZ`) values. The forward and up values are linearly independent of each other. The default is 0.
- {{domxref("AudioListener.upY")}}
  - : Represents the vertical position of the top of the listener's head in the same cartesian coordinate system as the position (`positionX`, `positionY`, and `positionZ`) values. The forward and up values are linearly independent of each other. The default is 1.
- {{domxref("AudioListener.upZ")}}
  - : Represents the longitudinal (back and forth) position of the top of the listener's head in the same cartesian coordinate system as the position (`positionX`, `positionY`, and `positionZ`) values. The forward and up values are linearly independent of each other. The default is 0.

## Methods

- {{domxref("AudioListener.setOrientation()")}} {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : Sets the orientation of the listener.
- {{domxref("AudioListener.setPosition()")}} {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : Sets the position of the listener.

> **Note:** Although these methods are deprecated they are currently the only way to set the orientation and position in Firefox, Internet Explorer and Safari.

## Deprecated features

- {{domxref("AudioListener.dopplerFactor")}} {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : A double value representing the amount of pitch shift to use when rendering a [doppler effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect).
- {{domxref("AudioListener.speedOfSound")}} {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : Is a double value representing the speed of sound, in _meters per second_.

In a previous version of the specification, the `dopplerFactor` and `speedOfSound` properties and the `setPosition()` method could be used to control the doppler effect applied to {{domxref("AudioBufferSourceNode")}}s connected downstream — these would be pitched up and down according to the relative speed of the {{domxref("PannerNode")}} and the {{domxref("AudioListener")}}. These features had a number of problems:

- Only {{domxref("AudioBufferSourceNode")}}s were pitched up or down, not other source nodes.
- The behavior to adopt when an {{domxref("AudioBufferSourceNode")}} was connected to multiple {{domxref("PannerNode")}}s was unclear.
- Because the velocity of the panner and the listener were not {{domxref("AudioParam")}}s, the pitch modification could not be smoothly applied, resulting in audio glitches.

Because of these issues, these properties and methods have been removed.

The `setOrientation()` and `setPosition()` methods have been replaced by setting their property value equivilents. For example `setPosition(x, y, z)` can be achieved by setting `positionX.value`, `positionY.value`, and `positionZ.value` respectively.
