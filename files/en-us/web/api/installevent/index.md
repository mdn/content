{{APIRef("Service Workers API")}}

The parameter passed into an {{DOMxRef("ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.install_event", "install")}} event handler function, the `InstallEvent` interface represents an install action that is dispatched on the {{domxref("ServiceWorkerGlobalScope")}} of a {{domxref("ServiceWorker")}}. As a child of {{domxref("ExtendableEvent")}}, it ensures that functional events such as {{domxref("FetchEvent")}} are not dispatched during installation.

This interface inherits from the {{domxref("ExtendableEvent")}} interface.

## Constructor

- {{domxref("InstallEvent.InstallEvent", "InstallEvent()")}} {{experimental_inline}}
  - : Creates a new `InstallEvent` object.

## Instance properties

_Inherits properties from its parent, {{domxref("ExtendableEvent")}}_.

## Instance methods

_Inherits methods from its parent, {{domxref("ExtendableEvent")}}_.

- {{domxref("InstallEvent.addRoutes()", "addRoutes()")}} {{experimental_inline}}
  - : Specifies one or more static routes, which define rules for fetching specified resources that will be used even before service worker startup.

## Examples

This code snippet is from the [service worker prefetch sample](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/samples/blob/gh-pages/service-worker/prefetch/service-worker.js) (see [prefetch running live](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/service-worker/prefetch/).) The code calls {{domxref("ExtendableEvent.waitUntil", "ExtendableEvent.waitUntil()")}} in {{domxref("ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.install_event", "ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.oninstall")}} and delays treating the {{domxref("ServiceWorkerRegistration.installing")}} worker as installed until the passed promise resolves successfully. The promise resolves when all resources have been fetched and cached, or when any exception occurs.

The code snippet also shows a best practice for versioning caches used by the service worker. Although this example has only one cache, you can use this approach for multiple caches. The code maps a shorthand identifier for a cache to a specific, versioned cache name.

> [!NOTE]
> Logging statements are visible in Google Chrome via the "Inspect" interface for the relevant service worker accessed via chrome://serviceworker-internals.

```js
const CACHE_VERSION = 1;
const CURRENT_CACHES = {
  prefetch: `prefetch-cache-v${CACHE_VERSION}`,
};

self.addEventListener("install", (event) => {
  const urlsToPrefetch = [
    "./static/pre_fetched.txt",
    "./static/pre_fetched.html",
    "https://www.chromium.org/_/rsrc/1302286216006/config/customLogo.gif",
  ];

  console.log(
    "Handling install event. Resources to pre-fetch:",
    urlsToPrefetch,
  );

  event.waitUntil(
    caches
      .open(CURRENT_CACHES["prefetch"])
      .then((cache) => {
        return cache
          .addAll(
            urlsToPrefetch.map((urlToPrefetch) => {
              return new Request(urlToPrefetch, { mode: "no-cors" });
            }),
          )
          .then(() => {
            console.log("All resources have been fetched and cached.");
          });
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.error("Pre-fetching failed:", error);
      }),
  );
});
```
