{{APIRef("HTML DOM")}}{{deprecated_header}}

The **`chOff`** property of the {{domxref("HTMLTableCellElement")}} interface does nothing. It reflects the `charoff` attribute of the cell element.

> [!NOTE]
> This property was designed to participate in an ability to align table cell content on a specific character (typically the decimal point), but was never implemented by browsers.
>
> To achieve such alignment, watch for the support of a string value with the {{cssxref("text-align")}} CSS property.
