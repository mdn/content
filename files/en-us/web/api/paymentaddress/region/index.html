<p>The read-only <strong><code>region</code></strong> property of the
  {{domxref('PaymentAddress')}} interface returns a string containing the top-level
  administrative subdivision of the country in which the address is located. For example,
  this may be a state, province, oblast, or prefecture.</p>

<pre
  class="brush: js notranslate">var <em>paymentRegion</em> = <em>PaymentAddress</em>.region;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A {{domxref("DOMString")}} specifying the top-level administrative subdivision within
  the country in which the address is located. This region has different names in
  different countries, such as: state, province, oblast, prefecture, or county.</p>

<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<p>In some countries, like Belgium, it's uncommon for people to provide a region as part
  of their postal address. In such cases, the browser returns an empty string as the value
  of <code>region</code>. However, the address should still be acceptable to use for its
  intended purpose (e.g., to ship a product). However, always verify addresses to make
  sure what the user provides is usable.</p>
