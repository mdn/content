<p>A sublocality is an area within a city, such as a neighborhood, borough, or district.
  In the United Kingdom, this is used to indicate the <strong>post town</strong> in the
  United Kingdom (known officially by the Royal Mail as the <strong>dependent
    locality</strong>). This is a disambiguating feature of addresses in places where a
  city may have areas that duplicate street names.</p>
