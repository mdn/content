{{ ApiRef("DOM") }}

The **`Comment`** interface represents textual notations within markup; although it is generally not visually shown, such comments are available to be read in the source view.

Comments are represented in HTML and XML as content between '`<!--`' and '`-->`'. In XML, the character sequence '`--`' cannot be used within a comment.
