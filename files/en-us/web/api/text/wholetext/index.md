{{ apiref("DOM") }}

The read-only **`wholeText`** property of the {{domxref("Text")}} interface
returns the full text of all {{domxref("Text")}} nodes logically adjacent to the node.
The text is concatenated in document order.
This allows specifying any text node and obtaining all adjacent text as a single string.

> **Note:** This is similar to call {{domxref("Node.normalize()")}} followed by reading the text value,
> but without modifying the tree.

## Value

A {{jsxref("String")}} with the concanated text.

## Example

Suppose you have the following simple paragraph within your webpage:

```html
<p>Through-hiking is great!  <strong>No insipid election coverage!</strong> However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absentee_ballot">casting a ballot</a> is tricky.</p>
```

You decide you don't like the middle sentence, so you remove it:

```js
const para = document.getElementsByTagname("p")[0]; // Reads the paragraph
para.removeChild(para.childNodes[1]); // Delete the strong element
```

Now you end up with _"Through-hiking is great! However, casting a ballot is tricky."_, with two nodes before the hyperlink:

1. `Through-hiking is great!`
2. ` However, `

To get those two nodes at once, you would call `para.childNodes[0].wholeText`:

```js
console.log( "'" + para.childNodes[0].wholeText + "'" ); // 'Through-hiking is great!   However, '
```
