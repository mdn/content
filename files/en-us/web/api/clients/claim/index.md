{{APIRef("Service Worker Clients")}}

The **`claim()`** method of the
{{domxref("Clients")}} interface allows an active service worker to set itself as the
{{domxref("ServiceWorkerContainer.controller", "controller")}} for all clients within
its {{domxref("ServiceWorkerRegistration.scope", "scope")}}. This triggers a
"`controllerchange`" event
on {{domxref("ServiceWorkerContainer","navigator.serviceWorker")}} in any clients that
become controlled by this service worker.

When a service worker is initially registered, pages won't use it until they next
load. The `claim()` method causes those pages to be controlled immediately.
Be aware that this results in your service worker controlling pages that loaded
regularly over the network, or possibly via a different service worker.

## Syntax

```js
await clients.claim();
```

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves to `undefined`.

## Example

The following example uses `claim()` inside service worker's
"`activate`" event listener so that clients loaded in the same scope do not
need to be reloaded before their fetches will go through this service worker.

```js
self.addEventListener('activate', event => {
  event.waitUntil(clients.claim());
});
```
