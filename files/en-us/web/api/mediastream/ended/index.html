<p>{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}{{deprecated_header}}</p>

<p>The <strong><code>ended</code></strong> read-only property of the
  {{domxref("MediaStream")}} interface returns a Boolean value which is <code>true</code> if the stream has been completely read, or <code>false</code> if the end of the stream has not been reached.
  This value  once the {{event("ended")}} event has been fired.</p>

<div class="warning">
  <p>This property has been removed from the specification; you should instead rely on the
    {{event("ended")}} event or check the value of
    {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.readyState")}} to see if its value is <code>"ended"</code>
    for the track or tracks you want to ensure have finished playing.</p>
</div>
