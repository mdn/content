{{APIRef("Media Capture and Streams")}}

The **`MediaStream`** interface represents a stream of media content. A stream consists of several **tracks**, such as video or audio tracks. Each track is specified as an instance of {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}}.

You can obtain a `MediaStream` object either by using the constructor or by calling functions such as {{domxref("MediaDevices.getUserMedia()")}}, {{domxref("MediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()")}}, or {{domxref("HTMLCanvasElement.captureStream()")}}.

Some user agents subclass this interface to provide more precise information or functionality, like in {{domxref("CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack")}}.

## Constructor

- {{domxref("MediaStream.MediaStream", "MediaStream()")}}
  - : Creates and returns a new MediaStream object. You can create an empty stream, a stream which is based upon an existing stream, or a stream that contains a specified list of tracks (specified as an array of {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} objects).

## Properties

_This interface inherits properties from its parent, {{domxref("EventTarget")}}._

- {{domxref("MediaStream.active")}} {{readonlyinline}}
  - : A Boolean value that returns `true` if the `MediaStream` is active, or `false` otherwise.
- {{domxref("MediaStream.ended")}} {{readonlyInline}} {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : A Boolean value set to `true` if the end of the stream has been reached. This has been removed from the specification; you should instead check the value of {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.readyState")}} to see if its value is `ended` for the track or tracks you want to ensure have finished playing.

<!---->

- {{domxref("MediaStream.id")}} {{readonlyInline}}
  - : A {{domxref("DOMString")}} containing 36 characters denoting a universally unique identifier (UUID) for the object.

### Event handlers

- {{domxref("MediaStream.onaddtrack")}}
  - : An [event handler](/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Event_handlers) containing the action to perform when an {{event("addtrack")}} event is fired when a new {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} object is added.
- {{domxref("MediaStream.onremovetrack")}}
  - : An [event handler](/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Event_handlers) containing the action to perform when a {{event("removetrack")}} event is fired when a {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} object is removed from it.

## Methods

_This interface inherits methods from its parent, {{domxref("EventTarget")}}._

- {{domxref("MediaStream.addTrack()")}}
  - : Stores a copy of the {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} given as argument. If the track has already been added to the `MediaStream` object, nothing happens.

<!---->

- {{domxref("MediaStream.clone()")}}
  - : Returns a clone of the `MediaStream` object. The clone will, however, have a unique value for {{domxref("MediaStream.id", "id")}}.

<!---->

- {{domxref("MediaStream.getAudioTracks()")}}
  - : Returns a list of the {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} objects stored in the `MediaStream` object that have their `kind` attribute set to `audio`. The order is not defined, and may not only vary from one browser to another, but also from one call to another.

<!---->

- {{domxref("MediaStream.getTrackById()")}}
  - : Returns the track whose ID corresponds to the one given in parameters, `trackid`. If no parameter is given, or if no track with that ID does exist, it returns `null`. If several tracks have the same ID, it returns the first one.
- {{domxref("MediaStream.getTracks()")}}
  - : Returns a list of all {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} objects stored in the `MediaStream` object, regardless of the value of the `kind` attribute. The order is not defined, and may not only vary from one browser to another, but also from one call to another.

<!---->

- {{domxref("MediaStream.getVideoTracks()")}}
  - : Returns a list of the {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} objects stored in the `MediaStream` object that have their `kind` attribute set to `"video"`. The order is not defined, and may not only vary from one browser to another, but also from one call to another.

<!---->

- {{domxref("MediaStream.removeTrack()")}}
  - : Removes the {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} given as argument. If the track is not part of the `MediaStream` object, nothing happens.

## Events

- {{domxref("MediaStream/addtrack_event", "addtrack")}}
  - : Fired when a new {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} object is added.
    Also available via the {{domxref("MediaStream/onaddtrack", "onaddtrack")}} property.
- {{domxref("MediaStream/removetrack_event", "removetrack")}}
  - : Fired when a {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} object has been removed.
    Also available via the {{domxref("MediaStream/onremovetrack", "onremovetrack")}} property.

<!---->

- {{domxref("MediaStream/active_event", "active")}}
  - : Fired when the MediaStream is activated.

<!---->

- {{domxref("MediaStream/inactive_event", "inactive")}}
  - : Fired when the MediaStream is inactivated.
