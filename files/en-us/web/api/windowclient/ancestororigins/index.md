The **`ancestorOrigins`** read-only property of the {{domxref("WindowClient")}} interface is an array of strings listing the origins of all ancestors of the browsing context represented by this `WindowClient` in reverse order.

The first element in the array is the origin of this window's parent, and the last element is the origin of the top-level browsing context. If this window is itself a top-level browsing context, then `ancestorOrigins` is an empty array.
