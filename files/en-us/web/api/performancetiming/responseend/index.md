The legacy
**`PerformanceTiming.responseEnd`**
read-only property returns an `unsigned long long` representing the moment,
in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch, when the browser received the last byte of the
response, or when the connection is closed if this happened first, from the server from
a cache or from a local resource.

## Value

An `unsigned long long`.

## Specifications
