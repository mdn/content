{{APIRef("Navigation Timing")}}{{Deprecated_Header}}

> **Warning:** This interface of this property is deprecated in the [Navigation Timing Level 2 specification](https://w3c.github.io/navigation-timing/#obsolete). Please use the {{domxref("PerformanceNavigationTiming")}}
> interface instead.

The legacy
**`PerformanceTiming.responseEnd`**
read-only property returns an `unsigned long long` representing the moment,
in milliseconds since the UNIX epoch, when the browser received the last byte of the
response, or when the connection is closed if this happened first, from the server from
a cache orÂ from a local resource.

## Syntax

```js
time = performanceTiming.responseEnd;
```

## Specifications

This feature is no longer on track to become a standard, as the [Navigation Timing specification](https://w3c.github.io/navigation-timing/#obsolete) has marked it as deprecated.
Use the {{domxref("PerformanceNavigationTiming")}} interface instead.
