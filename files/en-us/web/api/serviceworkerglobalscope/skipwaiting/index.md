{{APIRef("Service Workers API")}}

The **`ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.skipWaiting()`** method of the {{domxref("ServiceWorkerGlobalScope")}} forces the waiting service worker to become the active service worker.

Use this method with {{domxref("Clients.claim()")}} to ensure that updates to the underlying service worker take effect immediately for both the current client and all other active clients.

## Syntax

```js
ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.skipWaiting().then(function() {
  //Do something
});
```

### Returns

A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that immediately resolves with `undefined`.

## Example

While `self.skipWaiting()` can be called at any point during the service worker's execution, it will only have an effect if there's a newly installed service worker that might otherwise remain in the `waiting` state. Therefore, it's common to call `self.skipWaiting()` from inside of an {{domxref("InstallEvent")}} handler.

The following example causes a newly installed service worker to progress into the `activating` state, regardless of whether there is already an active service worker.

```js
self.addEventListener('install', function(event) {
  // The promise that skipWaiting() returns can be safely ignored.
  self.skipWaiting();

  // Perform any other actions required for your
  // service worker to install, potentially inside
  // of event.waitUntil();
});
```
