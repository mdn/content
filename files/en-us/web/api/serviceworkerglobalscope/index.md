{{APIRef("Service Workers API")}}

The **`ServiceWorkerGlobalScope`** interface of the [Service Worker API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) represents the global execution context of a service worker.

Developers should keep in mind that the ServiceWorker state is not persisted across the termination/restart cycle, so each event handler should assume it's being invoked with a bare, default global state.

Once successfully registered, a service worker can and will be terminated when idle to conserve memory and processor power. An active service worker is automatically restarted to respond to events, such as {{domxref("ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.fetch_event", "fetch")}} or {{domxref("ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.message_event", "message")}}.

Additionally, synchronous requests are not allowed from within a service worker â€” only asynchronous requests, like those initiated via the {{domxref("fetch()")}} method, can be used.

This interface inherits from the {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope")}} interface, and its parent {{domxref("EventTarget")}}.

## Instance properties

_This interface inherits properties from the {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope")}} interface, and its parent {{domxref("EventTarget")}}._

- {{domxref("ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.clients")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Contains the {{domxref("Clients")}} object associated with the service worker.
- {{domxref("ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.registration")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Contains the {{domxref("ServiceWorkerRegistration")}} object that represents the service worker's registration.

### Instance properties inherited from WorkerGlobalScope

- {{domxref("caches", "ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.caches")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Returns the {{domxref("CacheStorage")}} object associated with the current context. This object enables functionality such as storing assets for offline use, and generating custom responses to requests.
- {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope.console", "ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.console")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}} {{Non-standard_inline}}
  - : Returns the {{domxref("console")}} associated with the worker.
- {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope.fonts", "ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.fonts")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Returns the {{domxref("FontFaceSet")}} associated with the worker.
- {{domxref("indexedDB", "ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.indexedDB")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Provides a mechanism for applications to asynchronously access capabilities of indexed databases; returns an {{domxref("IDBFactory")}} object.
- {{domxref("isSecureContext", "ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.isSecureContext")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Returns a boolean indicating whether the current context is secure (`true`) or not (`false`).
- {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope.location", "ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.location")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Returns the {{domxref("WorkerLocation")}} associated with the worker. `WorkerLocation` is a specific location object, mostly a subset of the {{domxref("Location")}} for browsing scopes, but adapted to workers.
- {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope.navigator", "ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.navigator")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Returns the {{domxref("WorkerNavigator")}} associated with the worker. `WorkerNavigator` is a specific navigator object, mostly a subset of the {{domxref("Navigator")}} for browsing scopes, but adapted to workers.
- {{domxref("origin", "ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.origin")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Returns the global object's origin, serialized as a string.
- {{domxref("performance_property", "ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.performance")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Returns the {{domxref("Performance")}} object associated with the worker, which is a regular performance object, but with a subset of its properties and methods available.
- {{domxref("Window.scheduler", "ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.scheduler")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Returns the {{domxref("Scheduler")}} object associated with the current context. This is the entry point for using the [Prioritized Task Scheduling API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Prioritized_Task_Scheduling_API).
- {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope.self", "ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.self")}}
  - : Returns an object reference to the `ServiceWorkerGlobalScope` object itself.

## Instance methods

_This interface inherits methods from the {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope")}} interface, and its parent {{domxref("EventTarget")}}._

## Examples

This code snippet is from the [service worker prefetch sample](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/samples/blob/gh-pages/service-worker/prefetch/service-worker.js) (see [prefetch example live](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/service-worker/prefetch/).) The {{domxref("ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.fetch_event", "onfetch")}} event handler listens for the `fetch` event. When fired, the code returns a promise that resolves to the first matching request in the {{domxref("Cache")}} object. If no match is found, the code fetches a response from the network.

The code also handles exceptions thrown from the {{domxref("fetch()")}} operation. Note that an HTTP error response (e.g., 404) will not trigger an exception. It will return a normal response object that has the appropriate error code set.

```js
self.addEventListener("fetch", (event) => {
  console.log("Handling fetch event for", event.request.url);

  event.respondWith(
    caches.match(event.request).then((response) => {
      if (response) {
        console.log("Found response in cache:", response);

        return response;
      }
      console.log("No response found in cache. About to fetch from networkâ€¦");

      return fetch(event.request).then(
        (response) => {
          console.log("Response from network is:", response);

          return response;
        },
        (error) => {
          console.error("Fetching failed:", error);

          throw error;
        }
      );
    })
  );
});
```
