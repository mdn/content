{{APIRef("Service Workers API")}}

The **onmessage** property of the {{domxref("ServiceWorkerGlobalScope")}}
interface is an event handler fired whenever a
{{domxref("ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.message_event","message")}} event occurs â€” when
incoming messages are received.

> **Note:** Service workers define the extendable event to allow extending
> the lifetime of the event. For the `message` event, service workers use the
> {{domxref("ExtendableMessageEvent")}} interface which extends the
> {{domxref("ExtendableEvent")}} interface.

> **Note:** Messages received from service worker contexts (e.g. as the
> event object of `onmessage`) are represented by {{domxref("MessageEvent")}}
> objects in modern browsers, for consistency with other web messaging features. (They
> used to be represented by {{domxref("ServiceWorkerMessageEvent")}} objects, which have
> now been deprecated.)

## Syntax

```js
serviceWorkerGlobalScope.onmessage = function(extendableMessageEvent) { ... };
```
