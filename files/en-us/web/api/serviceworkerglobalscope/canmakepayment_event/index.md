{{APIRef("Payment Handler API")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`canmakepayment`** event of the {{domxref("ServiceWorkerGlobalScope")}} interface is fired on a payment app's service worker to check whether it is ready to handle a payment. Specifically, it is fired when the merchant website calls {{domxref("PaymentRequest.PaymentRequest", "new PaymentRequest()")}}.

## Syntax

Use the event name in methods like {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}}, or set an event handler property.

```js
addEventListener("canmakepayment", (event) => {});

oncanmakepayment = (event) => {};
```

## Event type

A {{domxref("CanMakePaymentEvent")}}. Inherits from {{domxref("ExtendableEvent")}}.

## Examples

The `canmakepayment` event is fired on a payment app's service worker to check whether it is ready to handle a payment. Specifically, it is fired when the merchant website calls {{domxref("PaymentRequest.PaymentRequest", "new PaymentRequest()")}}. The service worker can then use the {{domxref("CanMakePaymentEvent.respondWith()")}} method to respond appropriately:

```js
self.addEventListener("canmakepayment", (e) => {
  e.respondWith(
    new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
      someAppSpecificLogic()
        .then((result) => {
          resolve(result);
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          reject(error);
        });
    })
  );
});
```

`respondWith()` returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves with a boolean value to signal that the service worker is ready to handle a payment request (`true`), or not (`false`).
