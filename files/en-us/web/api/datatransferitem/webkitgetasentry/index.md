{{APIRef("File System API")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}{{Non-standard_header}}

If the item described by the {{domxref("DataTransferItem")}} is a file,
`webkitGetAsEntry()` returns a {{domxref("FileSystemFileEntry")}} or
{{domxref("FileSystemDirectoryEntry")}} representing it. If the item isn't a file,
`null` is returned.

> **Note:** This function is implemented as `webkitGetAsEntry()` in non-WebKit browsers including Firefox at this time; it may be renamed to
> `getAsEntry()` in the future, so you should code defensively, looking for both.

## Syntax

```js
DataTransferItem.webkitGetAsEntry();
```

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

A {{domxref("FileSystemEntry")}}-based object describing the dropped item. This will be
either {{domxref("FileSystemFileEntry")}} or {{domxref("FileSystemDirectoryEntry")}}.

## Example

In this example, a drop zone is created, which responds to the {{event("drop")}} event
by scanning through the dropped files and directories, outputting a hierarchical
directory listing.

### HTML content

The HTML establishes the drop zone itself, which is a {{HTMLElement("div")}} element
with the ID `"dropzone"`, and an unordered list element with the ID
`"listing"`.

```html
<p>Drag files and/or directories to the box below!</p>

<div id="dropzone">
  <div id="boxtitle">
    Drop Files Here
  </div>
</div>

<h2>Directory tree:</h2>

<ul id="listing">
</ul>
```

### CSS content

The styles used by the example are shown here.

```css
#dropzone {
  text-align: center;
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 4px dashed red;
  border-radius: 10px;
}

#boxtitle {
  display: table-cell;
  vertical-align: middle;
  text-align: center;
  color: black;
  font: bold 2em "Arial", sans-serif;
  width: 300px;
  height: 100px;
}

body {
  font: 14px "Arial", sans-serif;
}
```

### JavaScript content

First, let's look at the recursive `scanFiles()` function. This function
takes as input a {{domxref("FileSystemEntry")}} representing an entry in the file system
to be scanned and processed (the `item` parameter), and an element into which
to insert the list of contents (the `container` parameter).

> **Note:** To read all files in a directory, `readEntries` needs to be
> called repeatedly until it returns an empty array. In Chromium-based browsers, the
> following example will only return a max of 100 entries.

```js
let dropzone = document.getElementById("dropzone");
let listing = document.getElementById("listing");

function scanFiles(item, container) {
  let elem = document.createElement("li");
  elem.textContent = item.name;
  container.appendChild(elem);

 if (item.isDirectory) {
    let directoryReader = item.createReader();
    let directoryContainer = document.createElement("ul");
    container.appendChild(directoryContainer);
    directoryReader.readEntries(function(entries) {
        entries.forEach(function(entry) {
          scanFiles(entry, directoryContainer);
      });
    });
  }
}
```

`scanFiles()` begins by creating a new {{HTMLElement("li")}} element to
represent the item being scanned, inserts the name of the item into it as its text
content, and then appends it to the container. The container is always a list element in
this example, as you'll see shortly.

Once the current item is in the list, the item's
{{domxref("FileSystemEntry.isDirectory", "isDirectory")}} property is checked. If the
item is a directory, we need to recurse into that directory. The first step is to create
a {{domxref("FileSystemDirectoryReader")}} to handle fetching the directory's contents.
That's done by calling the item's {{domxref("FileSystemDirectoryEntry.createReader",
  "createReader()")}} method. Then a new {{HTMLElement("ul")}} is created and appended to
the parent list; this will contain the directory's contents in the next level down in
the list's hierarchy.

After that, {{domxref("FileSystemDirectoryReader.readEntries",
  "directoryReader.readEntries()")}} is called to read in all the entries in the
directory. These are each, in turn, passed into a recursive call to
`scanFiles()` to process them. Any of them which are files are inserted into
the list; any which are directories are inserted into the list and a new level of the
list's hierarchy is added below, and so forth.

Then come the event handlers. First, we prevent the {{event("dragover")}} event from
being handled by the default handler, so that our drop zone can receive the drop:

```js
dropzone.addEventListener("dragover", function(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
}, false);
```

The event handler that kicks everything off, of course, is the handler for the
{{event("drop")}} event:

```js
dropzone.addEventListener("drop", function(event) {
  let items = event.dataTransfer.items;

  event.preventDefault();
  listing.textContent = "";

  for (let i=0; i<items.length; i++) {
    let item = items[i].webkitGetAsEntry();

    if (item) {
        scanFiles(item, listing);
    }
  }
}, false);
```

This fetches the list of {{domxref("DataTransferItem")}} objects representing the items
dropped from `event.dataTransfer.items`. Then we call
{{domxref("Event.preventDefault()")}} to prevent the event from being handled further
after we're done.

Now it's time to start building the list. First, the list is emptied by setting
{{domxref("Node.textContent", "listing.textContent")}} to be empty. That leaves us with
an empty {{domxref("ul")}} to begin inserting directory entries into.

Then we iterate over the items in the list of dropped items. For each one, we call its
{{domxref("DataTransferItem.webkitGetAsEntry", "webkitGetAsEntry()")}} method to obtain
a {{domxref("FileSystemEntry")}} representing the file. If that's successful, we call
`scanFiles()` to process the itemâ€”either by adding it to the list if it's
just a file or by adding it and walking down into it if it's a directory.

### Result

You can see how this works by trying it out below. Find some files and directories and
drag them in, and take a look at the resulting output.
