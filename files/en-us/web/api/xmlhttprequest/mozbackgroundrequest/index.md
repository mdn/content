**`XMLHttpRequest.mozBackgroundRequest`** is a Boolean, indicating if the object represents a background service request. If `true`, no load group is associated with the request, with security dialogs prevented from being shown to the user.

In cases in where a security dialog (such as authentication or a bad certificate notification) would normally be shown, this request fails instead.

> **Note:** This property must be set before calling `open()`.
