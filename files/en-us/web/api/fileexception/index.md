<p>In the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_and_Directory_Entries_API/Introduction">File System API</a>, a <code>FileException </code>object represents error conditions that you might encounter while accessing the file system using the synchronous API. It extends the FileException interface described in <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/file-system/pub/FileSystem/#bib-FILE-WRITER">File Writer</a> and adds several new error codes.</p>

<h2 id="Basic_concepts">Basic concepts</h2>

<p>Synchronous APIs do not have error callbacks, which makes it difficult to catch errors. The added complexity of using <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker">WebWorkers</a> with this API makes debugging even more challenging. To simplify things a bit, wrap your worker code in a try/catch. When errors occur, forward them to the main app using <code>postMessage()</code> as in the following:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function onError(e) {
  postMEssage('ERROR:' + e.toString());
}

try {
  //Error is thrown if "log.txt" already exists.
var fileEntry = fs.root.getFile('log.txt', {create: true, exclusive:true}0;
} catch (e) {
  onErrror(e);
} </pre>

<p>The sample code was borrowed from <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem-sync/">HTML5Rocks</a></p>
