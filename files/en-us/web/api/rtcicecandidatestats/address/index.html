<p><span class="seoSummary">The <strong><code>address</code></strong> property of the
    {{domxref("RTCIceCandidateStats")}} dictionary indicates the address of the
    {{Glossary("ICE")}} candidate. While it's preferred that the address be specified as
    an IPv4 or IPv6 numeric address, a fully-qualified domain name can be used as
    well.</span> When a domain name is specified, the first IP address selected for that
  address is used, even if the domain name maps to multiple IP addresses.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js"><em>candidateAddress</em> = <em>rtcIceCandidateStats</em>.address;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>Either an IPv4 or IPv6 address or a fully-qualified domain name, which corresponds to
  the candidate.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the value of <code>address</code> is comprised entirely of digits from 0-9 with
    periods as separators, the value is interpreted as an IPv4 address.</li>
  <li>If the value is entirely comprised of hexadecimal digits and colon (":")Â 
    characters, it is interpreted as an IPv6 address.</li>
  <li>Otherwise, the <code>address</code> is presumed to be a fully-qualified domain name,
    which is resolved first using an AAAA record (assuming IPv6 is available), then using
    an A record (if no result is found or the device onlu supports IPv4). If multiple IP
    addresses are returned in response to the query, the {{Glossary("user agent")}}
    selects one, which is then used for the duration of ICE processing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<p>The <code>address</code> property was previously known as <code>ip</code>, and only
  permitted IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to be used. The addition of support for
  fully-qualified domain names to be used for the address brought about the renaming of
  the property.</p>
