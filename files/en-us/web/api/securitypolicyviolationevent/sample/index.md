{{APIRef("Reporting API")}}

The **`sample`** read-only property of the {{domxref("SecurityPolicyViolationEvent")}} interface is a string representing a sample of the resource that caused the [Content Security Policy (CSP)](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) violation.

## Value

A string containing a sample of the resource that caused the violation, usually the first 40 characters.
This will only be populated if the resource is an inline script, event handler, or style â€” external resources causing a violation
will not generate a sample.

## Examples

```js
document.addEventListener("securitypolicyviolation", (e) => {
  console.log(e.sample);
});
```
