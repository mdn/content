The **`sample`** read-only property of the
{{domxref("SecurityPolicyViolationEvent")}} interface is a string
representing a sample of the resource that caused the violation.

## Value

A string containing a sample of the resource that caused the
violation, usually the first 40 characters. This will only be populated if the resource
is an inline script, event handler, or style â€” external resources causing a violation
will not generate a sample.

## Examples

```js
document.addEventListener("securitypolicyviolation", (e) => {
  console.log(e.sample);
});
```
