The **`sample`** read-only property of the {{domxref("SecurityPolicyViolationEvent")}} interface is a string representing a sample of the resource that caused the [Content Security Policy (CSP)](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) violation.

This is only [`script-src*`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#script-src) and [`style-src*`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#style-src) violations, when the corresponding `Content-Security-Policy` directive contains the [`'report-sample'`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy#report-sample) keyword.
In addition, this will only be populated if the resource is an inline script, event handler, or style â€” external resources causing a violation will not generate a sample.
