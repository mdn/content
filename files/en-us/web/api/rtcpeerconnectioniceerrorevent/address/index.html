<p>The {{domxref("RTCPeerConnectionIceErrorEvent")}} property
  <code><strong>address</strong></code> is a string which indicates the local IP address
  being used to communicate with the {{Glossary("STUN")}} or {{Glossary("TURN")}} server
  during negotiations. The error which occurred involved this address.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js">let <em>address</em> = <em>rtcPeerConnectionIceErrorEvent</em>.address;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A {{domxref("DOMString")}} which specifies the local IP address of the network
  connection to the ICE server with which negotiations were occurring when the error
  occurred. This address identifies the network interface on the local device which is
  being used to attempt to establish the connection to the remote peer.</p>

<p>This can be useful on multi-homed systems—devices with more than one network
  connection—to determine which network interface is being used. For example, on a mobile
  phone, there are typically at least two network interfaces available: the cellular
  connection and a WiFi connection.</p>

<p>If the local IP address isn't exposed as part of a local candidate, the value of
  <code>address</code> is <code>null</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>This example creates a handler for
  {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.icecandidateerror_event", "icecandidateerror")}} events
  which creates human readable messages describing the local network interface for the
  connection as well as the ICE server that was being used to try to open the connection,
  then calls a function to display those as well as the event's
  {{domxref("RTCPeerConnectionIceErrorEvent.errorText", "errorText")}} property's
  contents.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">pc.addEventListener("icecandidateerror", (event) =&gt; {
  let networkInfo = `[Local interface: ${event.address}:${event.port}`;
  let iceServerInfo = `[ICE server: ${event.url}`;

  showMessage(errorText, iceServerInfo, networkInfo);
});</pre>
