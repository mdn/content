<p><span class="seoSummary">The {{domxref("RTCRtpStreamStats")}} dictionary's
    <code><strong>ssrc</strong></code> property provides the Synchronization Source
    (SSRC), an integer which uniquely identifies the source of the {{Glossary("RTP")}}
    packets whose statistics are covered by the {{domxref("RTCStatsReport")}} that
    includes this <code>RTCRtpStreamStats</code> dictionary.</span></p>

  class="brush: js">var <em>ssrc</em> = <em>RTCRtpStreamStats</em>.ssrc;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>The Synchronization Source (SSRC) is a 32-bit integer uniquely identifying the source
  of the RTP packets whose statistics are covered by the {{domxref("RTCStatsReport")}}
  object of which this <code>RTCRtpStreamStats</code> object is a component.</p>

<p>The manner in which these values are generated is not mandated by the specification,
  although it does make recommendations. You should not make any assumptions based on the
  value of <code>ssrc</code> other than that any two objects with the same
  <code>ssrc</code> value refer to the same source. See {{RFC("3550", "", "8")}} for
  additional information about <code>ssrc</code>.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The specification includes an example that generates values
    for <code>ssrc</code> using MD5. While not part of the standard, exactly, it is a good
    mechanism that may be used by some browsers; others may use other methods, such as
    random number generators. <em>Do not</em> rely upon these values meaning anything
    other than "these objects are associated with the same source."</p>
