<div>{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}</div>

<p><span class="seoSummary">The <strong><code>sliCount</code></strong> property of the
    {{domxref("RTCRtpStreamStats")}} dictionary indicates how many <strong>Slice Loss
      Indication</strong> (<strong>SLI</strong>) packets were received by the
    sender.</span> An SLI packet is used by a decoder to let the encoder know that it's
  detected corruption of one or more consecutive macroblocks in the received media.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js">var <em>sliCount</em> = <em>RTCRtpStreamStats</em>.sliCount;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>An unsigned long integer indicating the number of SLI packets the sender received from
  the receiver due to lost runs of macroblocks. A high value of <code>sliCount</code> may
  be an indication of an unreliable network.</p>

<p>For technical details, see {{RFC(4585, "6.3.2")}}.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This value is sent by the sender to the receiver and is only
    present for video media.</p>
