<p>The {{domxref("IntersectionObserverEntry")}} interface's read-only
  <strong><code>boundingClientRect</code></strong> property returns a
  {{domxref("DOMRectReadOnly")}} which in essence describes a rectangle describing the
  smallest rectangle that contains the entire target element.</p>

<pre class="brush: js"><var><code>var <em>boundsRect</em> = </code>IntersectionObserverEntry</var>.boundingClientRect;
</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A {{domxref("DOMRectReadOnly")}} which describes the smallest rectangle that contains
  every part of the target element whose intersection change is being described. This
  value is obtained using the same algorithm as
  {{domxref("Element.getBoundingClientRect()")}}, so refer to that article for details on
  precisely what is done to obtain this rectangle and what is and is not included within
  its bounds.</p>

<p>In the general case, however, it's safe to think of this as the bounds rectangle of the
  target element.</p>
