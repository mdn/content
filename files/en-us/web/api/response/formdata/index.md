{{APIRef("Fetch")}}

The **`formData()`** method of the {{domxref("Response")}} interface
takes a {{domxref("Response")}} stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise
that resolves with a {{domxref("FormData")}} object.

> **Note:** This is mainly relevant to [service workers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API). If a user submits
> a form and a service worker intercepts the request, you could for example call
> `formData()` on it to obtain a key-value map, modify some fields, then send
> the form onwards to the server (or use it locally).
