{{APIRef("File and Directory Entries API")}}{{Non-standard_Header}}{{Deprecated_Header}}

The `DirectoryEntrySync` interface represents a directory in a file system. It includes methods for creating, reading, looking up, and recursively removing files in a directory.

> **Warning:** This interface is deprecated and is no more on the standard track.
> _Do not use it anymore._ Use the [File and Directory Entries API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_and_Directory_Entries_API) instead.

## Basic concepts

If you want to create subdirectories, you have to create each child directory in sequence. If you try to create a directory using a full path that includes parent directories that do not exist yet, you get an error. So create the hierarchy by recursively adding a new path after creating the parent directory.

### Example

The `getFile()` method returns a `FileEntrySync`, which represents a file in the file system. The following creates an empty file called `logs.txt` in the root directory.

```js
const fileEntry = fs.root.getFile('logs.txt', {create: true});
```

The `getDirectory()` method returns a `DirectoryEntrySync`, which represents a file in the file system. The following creates a new directory called `project_dir` in the root directory.

```js
const dirEntry = fs.root.getDirectory('project_dir', {create: true});
```

## Methods

### createReader()

Creates a new `DirectoryReaderSync` to read entries from this directory.

#### Syntax

```
createReader()
```

##### Returns

- [`DirectoryReaderSync`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DirectoryReaderSync)
  - : Represents a directory in a file system.

##### Parameter

None

##### Exceptions

This method can raise a {{domxref("DOMException")}} with the following codes:

| Exception       | Description                                                                                |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NOT_FOUND_ERR` | The directory does not exist.                                                              |
| `SECURITY_ERR`  | The browser determined that it was not safe to look up the metadata. [ todo: Explain why ] |

### getFile()

Depending on how you've set the `options` parameter, the method either creates a file or looks up an existing file.

#### Syntax

```
getFile(path)
getFile(path, options)
```

##### Parameter

- `path`
  - : Either an absolute path or a relative path from the directory to the file to be looked up or created. You cannot create a file whose immediate parent does not exist. Create the parent directory first.
- `options`
  - : (optional) An object literal describing the behavior of the method. If the file does not exist, it is created.

### getDirectory()

Creates or looks up a directory. The method is similar to `getFile()` with DirectoryEntrySync being passed.

#### Syntax

```
getDirectory(path)
getDirectory(path, options)
```

  - : Either an absolute path or a relative path from the directory to the file to be looked up or created. You cannot create a file whose immediate parent does not exist. Create the parent directory first.
- `options`
  - : (optional) An object literal describing the behavior of the method if the file does not exist.

### removeRecursively()

Deletes a directory and all of its contents. You cannot delete the root directory of a file system.

If you delete a directory that contains a file that cannot be removed or if an error occurs while the deletion is in progress, some of the contents might not be deleted. Catch these cases with error callbacks and retry the deletion.

#### Syntax

```
removeRecursively()
```

##### Parameter

None

##### Returns

{{jsxref('undefined')}}

##### Exceptions

This method can raise a {{domxref("DOMException")}} with the following codes:

      <td><code>SECURITY_ERR</code></td>
