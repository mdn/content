<div>{{APIRef("DOM Events")}}</div>

<p><span class="seoSummary"><strong><code>KeyboardEvent</code></strong> objects describe a user interaction with the keyboard; each event describes a single interaction between the user and a key (or combination of a key with modifier keys) on the keyboard.</span> The event type ({{event('keydown')}}, {{event('keypress')}}, or {{event('keyup')}}) identifies what kind of keyboard activity occurred.</p>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <code>KeyboardEvent</code> events just indicate what interaction the user had with a key on the keyboard at a low level, providing no contextual meaning to that interaction. When you need to handle text input, use the {{event("input")}} event instead. Keyboard events may not be fired if the user is using an alternate means of entering text, such as a handwriting system on a tablet or graphics tablet.</div>

<p>The <code>KeyboardEvent</code> interface defines the following constants.</p>

<h3 id="Keyboard_locations">Keyboard locations</h3>

<p>The following constants identify which part of the keyboard the key event originates from. They are accessed as <code>KeyboardEvent.DOM_KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD</code> and so forth.</p>

  <tr>
   <td><code>DOM_KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD</code></td>
   <td>0x00</td>
   <td>
    <p>The key described by the event is not identified as being located in a particular area of the keyboard; it is not located on the numeric keypad (unless it's the NumLock key), and for keys that are duplicated on the left and right sides of the keyboard, the key is, for whatever reason, not to be associated with that location.</p>

    <p>Examples include alphanumeric keys on the standard PC 101 US keyboard, the NumLock key, and the space bar.</p>

  <tr>
   <td><code>DOM_KEY_LOCATION_LEFT</code></td>
   <td>0x01</td>
   <td>
    <p>The key is one which may exist in multiple locations on the keyboard and, in this instance, is on the left side of the keyboard.</p>

    <p>Examples include the left Control key, the left Command key on a Macintosh keyboard, or the left Shift key.</p>

   <td><code>DOM_KEY_LOCATION_RIGHT</code></td>
   <td>0x02</td>
   <td>
    <p>The key is one which may exist in multiple positions on the keyboard and, in this case, is located on the right side of the keyboard.</p>

    <p>Examples include the right Shift key and the right Alt key (Option on a Mac keyboard).</p>
   </td>

    <p>The key is located on the numeric keypad, or is a virtual key associated with the numeric keypad if there's more than one place the key could originate from. The NumLock key does not fall into this group and is always encoded with the location <code>DOM_KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD</code>.</p>

    <p>Examples include the digits on the numeric keypad, the keypad's Enter key, and the decimal point on the keypad.</p>

<h2 id="Events">Events</h2>

<p>The following events are based on the <code>KeyboardEvent</code> type. They can be delivered to any object which implements {{domxref("GlobalEventHandlers")}}, including {{domxref("Element")}}, {{domxref("Document")}}, and {{domxref("Window")}}. In the list below, each event links to the documentation for the <code>Document</code> handler for the event, which applies generally to all of the recipients.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>{{domxref("Document.keydown_event", "keydown")}}</dt>
 <dd>A key has been pressed.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("Document.keyup_event", "keyup")}}</dt>
 <dd>A key has been released.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Obsolete_events">Obsolete events</h3>

<dl>
 <dt>{{domxref("Document.keypress_event", "keypress")}} {{deprecated_inline}}</dt>
 <dd>A key that normally produces a character value has been pressed. This event was highly device-dependent and is obsolete. You should not use it.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<p>There are three types of keyboard events: {{event("keydown")}}, {{event("keypress")}}, and {{event("keyup")}}. For most keys, Gecko dispatches a sequence of key events like this:</p>

<ol>
 <li>When the key is first pressed, the <code>keydown</code> event is sent.</li>
 <li>If the key is not a modifier key, the <code>keypress</code> event is sent.</li>
 <li>When the user releases the key, the <code>keyup</code> event is sent.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Special_cases">Special cases</h3>

<p>Some keys toggle the state of an indicator light; these include keys such as Caps Lock, Num Lock, and Scroll Lock. On Windows and Linux, these keys dispatch only the <code>keydown</code> and <code>keyup</code> events.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>On Linux, Firefox 12 and earlier also dispatched the <code>keypress</code> event for these keys.</p>
</div>

<p>However, a limitation of the macOS event model causes Caps Lock to dispatch only the <code>keydown</code> event. Num Lock was supported on some older laptop models (2007 models and older), but since then, macOS hasn't supported Num Lock even on external keyboards. On older MacBooks with a Num Lock key, that key doesn't generate any key events. Gecko does support the Scroll Lock key if an external keyboard which has an F14 key is connected. In certain older versions of Firefox, this key generated a <code>keypress</code> event; this inconsistent behavior was {{bug(602812)}}.</p>

<h3 id="Auto-repeat_handling">Auto-repeat handling</h3>

<p>When a key is pressed and held down, it begins to auto-repeat. This results in a sequence of events similar to the following being dispatched:</p>

<ol>
 <li><code>keydown</code></li>
 <li><code>keypress</code></li>
 <li><code>keydown</code></li>
 <li><code>keypress</code></li>
 <li>&lt;&lt;repeating until the user releases the key&gt;&gt;</li>
 <li><code>keyup</code></li>
</ol>

<p>This is what the DOM Level 3 specification says should happen. There are some caveats, however, as described below.</p>

<h4 id="Auto-repeat_on_some_GTK_environments_such_as_Ubuntu_9.4">Auto-repeat on some GTK environments such as Ubuntu 9.4</h4>

<p>In some GTK-based environments, auto-repeat dispatches a native key-up event automatically during auto-repeat, and there's no way for Gecko to know the difference between a repeated series of keypresses and an auto-repeat. On those platforms, then, an auto-repeat key will generate the following sequence of events:</p>

<ol>
 <li><code>keydown</code></li>
 <li><code>keypress</code></li>
 <li><code>keyup</code></li>
 <li><code>keydown</code></li>
 <li><code>keypress</code></li>
 <li><code>keyup</code></li>
 <li>&lt;&lt;repeating until the user releases the key&gt;&gt;</li>
 <li><code>keyup</code></li>
</ol>

<p>In these environments, unfortunately, there's no way for web content to tell the difference between auto-repeating keys and keys that are just being pressed repeatedly.</p>

<h4 id="Auto-repeat_handling_prior_to_Gecko_5.0">Auto-repeat handling prior to Gecko 5.0</h4>

<p>Before Gecko 5.0 {{geckoRelease('5.0')}}, keyboard handling was less consistent across platforms.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>Windows</dt>
 <dd>Auto-repeat behavior is the same as in Gecko 4.0 and later.</dd>
 <dt>Mac</dt>
 <dd>After the initial keydown event, only keypress events are sent until the keyup event occurs; the inter-spaced keydown events are not sent.</dd>
 <dt>Linux</dt>
 <dd>The event behavior depends on the specific platform. It will either behave like Windows or Mac depending on what the native event model does.</dd>
</dl>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Manually firing an event does <em>not</em> generate the default action associated with that event. For example, manually firing a key event does not cause that letter to appear in a focused text input. In the case of UI events, this is important for security reasons, as it prevents scripts from simulating user actions that interact with the browser itself.</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<pre class="brush: js">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;script&gt;
'use strict';

document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) =&gt; {
  const keyName = event.key;

  if (keyName === 'Control') {
    // do not alert when only Control key is pressed.
    return;
  }

  if (event.ctrlKey) {
    // Even though event.key is not 'Control' (e.g., 'a' is pressed),
    // event.ctrlKey may be true if Ctrl key is pressed at the same time.
    alert(`Combination of ctrlKey + ${keyName}`);
  } else {
    alert(`Key pressed ${keyName}`);
  }
}, false);

document.addEventListener('keyup', (event) =&gt; {
  const keyName = event.key;

  // As the user releases the Ctrl key, the key is no longer active,
  // so event.ctrlKey is false.
  if (keyName === 'Control') {
    alert('Control key was released');
  }
}, false);

&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<h2 id="Specifications">Specifications</h2>

{{Specifications}}

<p>The <code>KeyboardEvent</code> interface specification went through numerous draft versions, first under DOM Events Level 2 where it was dropped as no consensus arose, then under DOM Events Level 3. This led to the implementation of non-standard initialization methods, the early DOM Events Level 2 version, {{domxref("KeyboardEvent.initKeyEvent()")}} by Gecko browsers and the early DOM Events Level 3 version, {{domxref("KeyboardEvent.initKeyboardEvent()")}} by others. Both have been superseded by the modern usage of a constructor: {{domxref("KeyboardEvent.KeyboardEvent", "KeyboardEvent()")}}.</p>
