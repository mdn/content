{{APIRef("UI Events")}}{{non-standard_header}}{{deprecated_header}}

The deprecated **`KeyboardEvent.keyIdentifier`** read-only property returns a "key identifier" string that can be used to determine what key was pressed. Its non-deprecated replacement is {{domxref("KeyboardEvent.key")}}.

## Specifications

_Not part of any current specification._ This property was part of [an old draft of the DOM Level 3 Events Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-DOM-Level-3-Events-20090908/#events-Events-KeyboardEvent-keyIdentifier), but it was removed in later drafts in favor of {{domxref("KeyboardEvent.key")}}.

## Browser compatibility
