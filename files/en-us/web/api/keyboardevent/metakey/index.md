{{APIRef("UI Events")}}

The **`KeyboardEvent.metaKey`** read-only property returning a
boolean value that indicates if the <kbd>Meta</kbd> key was pressed
(`true`) or not (`false`) when the event occurred. Some operating
systems may intercept the key so it is never detected.

> **Note:** On Macintosh keyboards, this is the <kbd>⌘ Command</kbd> key.

> **Note:** Before Firefox 118, the <kbd>⊞ Windows</kbd> key was handled
> as an "OS" key rather than the "Meta" key. `KeyboardEvent.metaKey` was
> `false` when the <kbd>⊞ Windows</kbd> key was pressed.

## Value

```html
<button onclick="ismetaKey(event)">Click me with the meta key</button>

  document.querySelector("#output").textContent =
    `metaKey pressed? ${e.metaKey}`;
}
```
