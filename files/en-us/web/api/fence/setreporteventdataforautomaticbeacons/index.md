{{SeeCompatTable}}{{APIRef("Fenced Frame API")}}

The **`setReportEventDataForAutomaticBeacons()`** method of the
{{domxref("Fence")}} interface specifies event data that will be sent when a navigation occurs inside a {{htmlelement("fencedframe")}}. This data will be sent via an automatic [beacon](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Beacon_API) to one or more specific URLs registered via the {{domxref("InterestGroupReportingScriptRunnerGlobalScope.registerAdBeacon", "registerAdBeacon()")}} method of the [Protected Audience API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/fledge/), for the purpose of collecting reporting data for ad auction results.

> **Note:** {{domxref("Fence.reportEvent", "reportEvent()")}} provides similar report data submission, except in that case the submission is triggered via an explicit method call rather than a navigation.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
setReportEventDataForAutomaticBeacons(event)
```

### Parameters

- `event`
  - : an object representing the data to send. The required properties are as follows:
    - `eventType`
      - : A string representing the type of event that is being reported â€” this is currently always the special event identifier `reserved.top_navigation`.
    - `eventData`
      - : A string representing the data to be sent.
    - `destination`
      - : An array containing one or more enumerated values representing destination types. These are the involved parties that will receive the data to their registered URLs (i.e. via {{domxref("InterestGroupReportingScriptRunnerGlobalScope.registerAdBeacon", "registerAdBeacon()")}}). The possible values are:
        - `"buyer"`: The bidder in the ad auction.
        - `"seller"`: The top-level seller running the ad auction.
        - `"component-seller"`: The seller for a component auction in a multi-level auction.
        - `"direct-seller"`: The seller that ran the top-level or component auction that the buyer bid in.
        - `"shared-storage-select-url"`: A [Shared Storage API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/shared-storage/) storage location, as defined in a {{domxref("WindowSharedStorage.selectURL()")}} method call.

### Return value

None (`Undefined`).

## Examples

```js
window.fence.setReportEventDataForAutomaticBeacons({
  eventType: "reserved.top_navigation",
  eventData: "an example string",
  destination: ["seller", "buyer"],
