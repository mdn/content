<p class="summary">The <strong><code>durability</code></strong> read-only property of the
  {{domxref("IDBTransaction")}} interface returns the durability hint the transaction was
  created with. This is a hint to the user agent of whether to prioritize performance or
  durability when committing the transaction.</p>

<pre
  class="brush: js">var <var>transactionDurability</var> = idbTransaction.durability;</pre>

<h3>Value</h3>
<p>Any of the following literal {{jsxref('String', 'strings')}}:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>"strict"</code>: The user agent may consider that the transaction has
    successfully committed only after verifying that all outstanding changes have been
    successfully written to a persistent storage medium.</li>
  <li><code>"relaxed"</code>: The user agent may consider that the transaction has
    successfully committed as soon as all outstanding changes have been written to the
    operating system, without subsequent verification.</li>
  <li><code>"default"</code>: The user agent should use its default durability behavior
    for the storage bucket. This is the default for transactions if not otherwise
    specified.</li>
</ul>
