{{draft}}{{securecontext_header}}{{DefaultAPISidebar("IndexedDB")}}

The **`durability`** read-only property of the
{{domxref("IDBTransaction")}} interface returns the durability hint the transaction was
created with. This is a hint to the user agent of whether to prioritize performance or
durability when committing the transaction.

## Syntax

```js
var transactionDurability = idbTransaction.durability;
```

### Value

Any of the following literal {{jsxref('String', 'strings')}}:

- `"strict"`: The user agent may consider that the transaction has
  successfully committed only after verifying that all outstanding changes have been
  successfully written to a persistent storage medium.
- `"relaxed"`: The user agent may consider that the transaction has
  successfully committed as soon as all outstanding changes have been written to the
  operating system, without subsequent verification.
- `"default"`: The user agent should use its default durability behavior
  for the storage bucket. This is the default for transactions if not otherwise
  specified.
