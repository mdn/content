<p><span class="seoSummary">The read-only <strong><code>audioLevel</code></strong>
    property of the {{domxref("RTCRtpContributingSource")}} dictionary contains the audio
    level contained in the last RTP packet played from the described source.</span>
  audioLevel will be the level value defined in [RFC6465] if the RFC 6465 header extension
  is present, and otherwise null.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js">var <em>audioLevel</em> = <em>RTCRtpContributingSource</em>.audioLevel</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A double-precision floating-point number which indicates the volume level of the audio
  in the most recently received RTP packet from the source described by the
  <code>RTCRtpContributingSource</code>.</p>

<p>This value, which is in the range 0.0 to 1.0, is on a linear scale and its value is
  defined in dBov, or decibels (overload). This is the amplitude relative to the point at
  which clipping of the audio begins to occur. A value of 1.0 represents 0 dBov (maximum
  volume), a value of 0.0 represents silence, and a value of 0.5 represents approximately
  6 dB SPL (decibels of sound pressure level) change in the sound pressure level from 0
  dBov.</p>

<p>For both <code>RTCRtpContributingSource</code> and
  {{domxref("RTCRtpSynchronizationSource")}}, the audio level is converted to this form
  from the values defined in the specifications corresponding to each type of source.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><code>audioLevel</code> may be absent from <code>RTCRtpContributingSource</code>
    objects, which indicates that no volume level was provided by the source; however, it
    is <em>required</em> and always available on all
    <code>RTCRtpSynchronizationSource</code> objects.</p>
