<p>{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}</p>

<p><span class="seoSummary">The {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}}
		method <code><strong>setRemoteDescription()</strong></code> sets the specified
		session description as the remote peer's current offer or answer. The description
		specifies the properties of the remote end of the connection, including the media
		format.</span> The method takes a single parameter—the session description—and it
	returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}} which is fulfilled once the description has been
	changed, asynchronously.</p>

<p>This is typically called after receiving an offer or answer from another peer over the
	signaling server. Keep in mind that if <code>setRemoteDescription()</code> is called
	while a connection is already in place, it means renegotiation is underway (possibly
	to adapt to changing network conditions).</p>

<p>Because descriptions will be exchanged until the two peers agree on a configuration,
	the description submitted by calling <code>setRemoteDescription()</code> does not
	immediately take effect. Instead, the current connection configuration remains in
	place until negotiation is complete. Only then does the agreed-upon configuration take
	effect.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush: js"><em>aPromise</em> = <em>rtcPeerConnection</em>.setRemoteDescription(<em>sessionDescription</em>);
</pre>

<h3 id="Parameters">Parameters</h3>

<dl>
	<dt><code>sessionDescription</code></dt>
	<dd>An {{domxref("RTCSessionDescriptionInit")}} or
		{{domxref("RTCSessionDescription")}} which specifies the remote peer's current
		offer or answer. This value is an offer or answer received from the remote
		peer through your implementation of </dd>
</dl>

<p>The <code>sessionDescription</code> parameter is technically of type
	<code>RTCSessionDescriptionInit</code>, but because
	{{domxref("RTCSessionDescription")}} serializes to be indistinguishable from
	<code>RTCSessionDescriptionInit</code>, you can also pass in an
	<code>RTCSessionDescription</code>. This lets you simplify code such as the following:
</p>

<pre class="brush: js">myPeerConnection.setRemoteDescription(new RTCSessionDescription(description))
.then(function () {
  return createMyStream();
})
</pre>

<p>to be:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">myPeerConnection.setRemoteDescription(description)
.then(function () {
  return createMyStream();
})</pre>

<p>Using
	<code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">async</a></code>/<code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await">await</a></code>
	syntax, you can further simplify this to:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">await myPeerConnection.setRemoteDescription(description);
createMyStream();</pre>

<p>Since it's unnecessary, the {{domxref("RTCSessionDescription.RTCSessionDescription",
	"RTCSessionDescription()")}} constructor is deprecated.</p>

<h3 id="Return_value">Return value</h3>

<p>A {{jsxref("Promise")}} which is fulfilled once the value of the connection's
	{{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.remoteDescription", "remoteDescription")}} is
	successfully changed or rejected if the change cannot be applied (for example, if the
	specified description is incompatible with one or both of the peers on the
	connection). The promise fulfillment handler receives no input parameters.</p>

<div class="note">
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> The process of changing descriptions actually involves
		intermediary steps handled by the WebRTC layer to ensure that an active connection
		can be changed without losing the connection if the change does not succeed. See
		{{SectionOnPage("/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Connectivity", "Pending and
		current descriptions")}} for more details on this process.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Exceptions">Exceptions</h3>

<p>The following exceptions are reported to the rejection handler for the promise returned
	by <code>setRemoteDescription()</code>:</p>

<dl>
	<dt><code>InvalidAccessError</code></dt>
	<dd>The content of the description is invalid.</dd>
	<dt><code>InvalidStateError</code></dt>
	<dd>The {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}} is closed, or it's in a state which isn't
		compatible with the specified description's
		{{domxref("RTCSessionDescription.type", "type")}}. For example, if the
		<code>type</code> is <code>rollback</code> and the signaling state is one of
		<code>stable</code>, <code>have-local-pranswer</code>, or
		<code>have-remote-pranswer</code>, this exception is thrown, because you can't
		roll back a connection that's either fully established or is in the final stage of
		becoming connected.</dd>
	<dt><code>OperationError</code></dt>
	<dd>Any errors that occur which don't match the others specifeid here are reported as
		<code>OperationError</code>. This includes identity validation errors.</dd>
	<dt><code>RTCError</code></dt>
	<dd>An <code>RTCError</code> with the {{domxref("RTCError.errorDetail",
		"errorDetail")}} set to <code>sdp-syntax-error</code> is reported if the
		{{Glossary("SDP")}} specified by {{domxref("RTCSessionDescription.sdp")}}. The
		error object's {{domxref("RTCError.sdpLineNumber", "sdpLineNumber")}} property
		indicates the line number within the SDP on which the syntax error was detected.
	</dd>
	<dt><code>TypeError</code></dt>
	<dd>The specified <code>RTCSessionDescriptionInit</code> or
		<code>RTCSessionDescription</code> object is missing the
		{{domxref("RTCSessionDescription.type", "type")}} property, or no description
		parameter was provided at all.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<p>When you call <code>setRemoteDescription()</code>, the ICE agent checks to make sure
	the {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}} is in either the <code>stable</code> or
	<code>have-remote-offer</code> {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.signalingState",
	"signalingState")}}. These states indicate that either an existing connection is being
	renegotiated or that an offer previously specified by an earlier call to
	<code>setRemoteDescription()</code> is to be replaced with the new offer. In either of
	those two cases, we're at the beginning of the negotiation process, and the offer is
	set as the remote description.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we're in the middle of an ongoing negotiation and an offer is
	passed into <code>setRemoteDescription()</code>, the ICE agent automatically begins an
	ICE rollback in order to return the connection to a stable signaling state, then, once
	the rollback is completed, sets the remote description to the specified offer. This
	begins a new negotiation session, with the newly-established offer as the starting
	point.</p>

<p>Upon starting the new negotiation with the newly-established offer, the local peer is
	now the callee, even if it was previously the caller. This happens instead of throwing
	an exception, thereby reducing the number of potential errors which might occur, and
	simplifies the processing you need to do when you receive an offer, by eliminating the
	need to handle the offer/answer process differently depending on whether the local
	peer is the caller or callee.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> Earlier implementations of WebRTC would throw an exception
		if an offer was set outside a <code>stable</code> or
		<code>have-remote-offer</code> state.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Deprecated_syntax">Deprecated syntax</h2>

<p>In older code and documentation, you may see a callback-based version of this function
	used. This has been deprecated and its use is <em>strongly</em> discouraged. You
	should update any existing code to use the {{jsxref("Promise")}}-based version of
	<code>setRemoteDescription()</code> instead. The parameters for the older form of
	<code>setRemoteDescription()</code> are described below, to aid in updating existing
	code.</p>

<pre
	class="brush: js"><em>pc</em>.setRemoteDescription(<em>sessionDescription</em>, <em>successCallback</em>, <em>errorCallback</em>);</pre>

<h3 id="Parameters_2">Parameters</h3>

<dl>
	<dt><code>successCallback</code> {{deprecated_inline}}</dt>
	<dd>A JavaScript {{jsxref("Function")}} which accepts no input parameters to be called
		once the description has been successfully set. At that time, the offer can be
		sent to a remote peer via the signaling server.</dd>
	<dt><code>errorCallback</code> {{deprecated_inline}}</dt>
	<dd>A function matching the signautre <code>RTCPeerConnectionErrorCallback</code>
		which gets called if the description can't be set. It is passed a single
		{{domxref("DOMException")}} object explaining why the request failed.</dd>
</dl>

<p>This deprecated form of the method returns instantaneously without waiting for the
	actual setting to be done: in case of success, the <code>successCallback</code> will
	be called; in case of failure, the <code>errorCallback</code> will be called.</p>

<h3 id="Exceptions_2">Exceptions</h3>

<p>When using the deprecated callback-based version of
	<code>setRemoteDescription()</code>, the following exceptions may occur:</p>

<dl>
	<dt><code>InvalidStateError</code> {{deprecated_inline}}</dt>
	<dd>The connection's {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.signalingState", "signalingState")}}
		is <code>"closed"</code>, indicating that the connection is not currently open, so
		negotiation cannot take place.</dd>
	<dt><code>InvalidSessionDescriptionError</code> {{deprecated_inline}}</dt>
	<dd>The {{domxref("RTCSessionDescription")}} specified by the
		<code>sessionDescription</code> parameter is invalid.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>Here we see a function which handles an offer received from the remote peer. This code
	is derived from the example and tutorial in the article <a
		href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Signaling_and_video_calling">Signaling and
		video calling</a>; take a look at that for more details and a more in-depth
	explanation of what's going on.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function handleOffer(msg) {
  createMyPeerConnection();

  myPeerConnection.setRemoteDescription(msg.description).then(function () {
    return navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia(mediaConstraints);
  })
  .then(function(stream) {
    document.getElementById("local_video").srcObject = stream;
    return myPeerConnection.addStream(stream);
  })
  .then(function() {
    return myPeerConnection.createAnswer();
  })
  .then(function(answer) {
    return myPeerConnection.setLocalDescription(answer);
  })
  .then(function() {
    // Send the answer to the remote peer using the signaling server
  })
  .catch(handleGetUserMediaError);
}</pre>

<p>After creating our {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}} and saving it as
	<code>myPeerConnection</code>, we pass the description included in the received offer
	message, <code>msg</code>, directly into <code>setRemoteDescription()</code> to tell
	the user agent's WebRTC layer what configuration the caller has proposed using. When
	our promise fulfillment handler is called, indicating that this has been done, we
	create a stream, add it to the connection, then create an SDP answer and call
	{{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.setLocalDescription", "setLocalDescription()")}} to set
	that as the configuration at our end of the call before forwarding that answer to the
	caller.</p>
