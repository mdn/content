<div>{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}</div>

<p><span class="seoSummary">The <strong><code>createOffer()</code></strong> method of the
    {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}} interface initiates the creation of an
    {{Glossary("SDP")}} offer for the purpose of starting a new WebRTC connection to a
    remote peer.</span> The SDP offer includes information about any
  {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}}s already attached to the WebRTC session, codec, and
  options supported by the browser, and any candidates already gathered by the
  {{Glossary("ICE")}} agent, for the purpose of being sent over the signaling channel to a
  potential peer to request a connection or to update the configuration of an existing
  connection.</p>

<p>The return value is a {{domxref("Promise")}} which, when the offer has been created, is
  resolved with a {{domxref("RTCSessionDescription")}} object containing the newly-created
  offer.</p>

<h3 id="Parameters">Parameters</h3>

<dl>
  <dt><code>options</code> {{optional_inline}}</dt>
  <dd>An <code><a href="#rtcofferoptions_dictionary">RTCOfferOptions</a></code> dictionary
    providing options requested for the offer.</dd>
</dl>

<h4 id="RTCOfferOptions_dictionary">RTCOfferOptions dictionary</h4>

<p>The <code>RTCOfferOptions</code> dictionary is used to customize the offer created by
  this method.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCOfferOptions/iceRestart">iceRestart</a></code>
    {{optional_inline}}</dt>
  <dd>To restart ICE on an active connection, set this to <code>true</code>. This will
    cause the returned offer to have different credentials than those already in place. If
    you then apply the returned offer, ICE will restart. Specify <code>false</code> to
    keep the same credentials and therefore not restart ICE. <strong>The default is
      <code>false</code></strong>.</dd>
  <dt><code>offerToReceiveAudio</code> {{optional_inline}} (Legacy)</dt>
  <dd>A legacy Boolean option which used to control whether or not to offer to the remote
    peer the opportunity to try to send audio. If this value is <code>false</code>, the
    remote peer will not be offered to send audio data, even if the local side will be
    sending audio data. If this value is <code>true</code>, the remote peer will be
    offered to send audio data, even if the local side will <em>not</em> be sending audio
    data. The default behavior is to offer to receive audio only if the local side is
    sending audio, not otherwise.</dd>
  <dd>To emulate this behavior in modern implementations, the presence of this member with
    a value <code>false</code>, will set the direction of all existing audio transceivers
    to exclude reception (i.e. set to either <code>"sendonly"</code> or
    <code>"inactive"</code>).</dd>
  <dd>In modern implementations, the presence of this member with a value
    <code>true</code>, will ensure there is at least one transceiver set to receive audio
    that has not been stopped, and if there isn't one, one will be created.</dd>
  <dd>
    <div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You shouldn't use this legacy property.
      Instead, use {{domxref("RTCRtpTransceiver")}} to control whether or not to accept
      incoming audio.</div>
  </dd>
  <dt><code>offerToReceiveVideo</code> {{optional_inline}} (Legacy)</dt>
  <dd>A legacy Boolean option which used to control whether or not to offer to the remote
    peer the opportunity to try to send video. If this value is <code>false</code>, the
    remote peer will not be offered to send video data, even if the local side will be
    sending video data. If this value is <code>true</code>, the remote peer will be
    offered to send video data, even if the local side will <em>not</em> be sending video
    data. The default behavior is to offer to receive video only if the local side is
    sending video, not otherwise.</dd>
  <dd>To emulate this behavior in modern implementations, the presence of this member with
    a value <code>false</code>, will set the direction of all existing video transceivers
    to exclude reception (i.e. set to either <code>"sendonly"</code> or
    <code>"inactive"</code>).</dd>
  <dd>In modern implementations, the presence of this member with a value
    <code>true</code>, will ensure there is at least one transceiver set to receive video

  </dd>
  <dt><code>voiceActivityDetection</code> {{optional_inline}}</dt>
  <dd>Some codecs and hardware are able to detect when audio begins and ends by watching
    for "silence" (or relatively low sound levels) to occur. This reduces network
    bandwidth used for audio by only sending audio data when there's actually something to
    broadcast. However, in some cases, this is unwanted. For example, in the case of music
    or other non-voice transmission, this can cause loss of important low-volume sounds.
    Also, emergency calls should never cut audio when quiet. <strong>This option defaults
      to <code>true</code></strong> (voice activity detection <em>enabled</em>).</dd>

<h3 id="Deprecated_parameters">Deprecated parameters</h3>

<p>In older code and documentation, you may see a callback-based version of this function.
  This has been deprecated and its use is <strong>strongly</strong> discouraged. You
  should update any existing code to use the {{jsxref("Promise")}}-based version of
  <code>createOffer()</code> instead. The parameters for this form of
  <code>createOffer()</code> are described below, to aid in updating existing code. </p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>successCallback</code> {{deprecated_inline}}</dt>
  <dd>A <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function">callback function</a> which will be passed a single
    {{domxref("RTCSessionDescription")}} object describing the newly-created offer.</dd>
  <dt><code>errorCallback</code> {{deprecated_inline}}</dt>
  <dd>A <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function">callback function</a> which will be passed a single
    {{domxref("DOMException")}} object explaining why the request to create an offer
    failed.</dd>
  <dt><code>options</code> {{optional_inline}}</dt>
  <dd>An optional <code><a href="#rtcofferoptions_dictionary">RTCOfferOptions</a></code>
    dictionary providing options requested for the offer.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Return_value">Return value</h3>

<p>A {{jsxref("Promise")}} whose fulfillment handler will receive an object conforming to
  the {{domxref("RTCSessionDescriptionInit")}} dictionary which contains the SDP
  describing the generated offer. That received offer should be delivered through the
  signaling server to a remote peer.</p>

<h3 id="Exceptions">Exceptions</h3>

<p>These exceptions are returned by rejecting the returned promise. Your rejection handler
  should examine the received exception to determine which occurred.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>InvalidStateError</code></dt>
  <dd>The <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> is closed.</dd>
  <dt><code>NotReadableError</code></dt>
  <dd>No certificate or set of certificates was provided for securing the connection, and
    <code>createOffer()</code> was unable to create a new one. Since all WebRTC
    connections are required to be secured, that results in an error.</dd>
  <dt><code>OperationError</code></dt>
  <dd>Examining the state of the system to determine resource availability in order to
    generate the offer failed for some reason.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>Here we see a handler for the {{event("negotiationneeded")}} event which creates the
  offer and sends it to the remote system over a signaling channel.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Keep in mind that this is part of the signaling process, the
    transport layer for which is an implementation detail that's entirely up to you. In
    this case, a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket_API">WebSocket</a> connection is
    used to send a {{Glossary("JSON")}} message with a <code>type</code> field with the
    value "video-offer" to the other peer. The contents of the object being passed to the
    <code>sendToServer()</code> function, along with everything else in the promise
    fulfillment handler, depend entirely on your design.</p>
</div>

<pre class="brush: js">  myPeerConnection.createOffer().then(function(offer) {
    return myPeerConnection.setLocalDescription(offer);
  })
  .then(function() {
    sendToServer({
      name: myUsername,
      target: targetUsername,
      type: "video-offer",
      sdp: myPeerConnection.localDescription
    });
  })
  .catch(function(reason) {
    // An error occurred, so handle the failure to connect
  });</pre>

<p>In this code, the offer is created, and once successful, the local end of the
  {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}} is configured to match by passing the offer (which is
  represented using an object conforming to {{domxref("RTCSessionDescriptionInit")}}) into
  {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.setLocalDescription", "setLocalDescription()")}}. Once
  that's done, the offer is sent to the remote system over the signaling channel; in this
  case, by using a custom function called <code>sendToServer()</code>. The implementation
  of the signaling server is independent from the WebRTC specification, so it doesn't
  matter how the offer is sent as long as both the caller and potential receiver are using
  the same one.</p>

<p>Use {{jsxref("Promise.catch()")}} to trap and handle errors.</p>

<p>See <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Signaling_and_video_calling">Signaling and
    video calling</a> for the complete example from which this snippet is derived; this
  will help you to understand how the signaling code here works.</p>
