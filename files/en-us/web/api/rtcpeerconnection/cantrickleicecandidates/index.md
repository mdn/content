{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}

The read-only **{{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}}** property **`canTrickleIceCandidates`**
returns a boolean value which indicates whether or not the remote peer can accept
[trickled ICE candidates](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-mmusic-trickle-ice).

**ICE trickling** is the process of continuing to send candidates after
the initial offer or answer has already been sent to the other peer.

This property is only set after having called
{{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.setRemoteDescription()")}}. Ideally, your signaling
protocol provides a way to detect trickling support, so that you don't need to rely on
this property. A WebRTC browser will always support trickle ICE. If trickling isn't
supported, or you aren't able to tell, you can check for a falsy value for this
property and then wait until the value of
{{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.iceGatheringState", "iceGatheringState")}} changes to
`"completed"` before creating and sending the initial offer. That way, the
offer contains all of the candidates.

## Syntax

```js
 var canTrickle = RTCPeerConnection.canTrickleIceCandidates;
```

### Value

A boolean value that is `true` if the remote peer can accept
trickled ICE candidates and `false` if it cannot. If no remote peer has
been established, this value is `null`.

> **Note:** This property's value is determined once the local peer has
> called {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.setRemoteDescription()")}}; the provided
> description is used by the ICE agent to determine whether or not the remote peer
> supports trickled ICE candidates.

## Example

    const pc = new RTCPeerConnection();

    function waitToCompleteIceGathering(pc) {
        return new Promise(resolve => {
            pc.addEventListener('icegatheringstatechange', e => (e.target.iceGatheringState === 'complete') && resolve(pc.localDescription));
        });
    }

    // The following code might be used to handle an offer from a peer when
    // it isn't known whether it supports trickle ICE.
    async function newPeer(remoteOffer) {
        await pc.setRemoteDescription(remoteOffer);
        const offer = await pc.createOffer();
        await pc.setLocalDescription(offer);
        if (pc.canTrickleIceCandidates) return pc.localDescription;
        const answer = await waitToCompleteIceGathering(pc);
        sendAnswerToPeer(answer); //To peer via signaling channel
    }
    // Handle error with try/catch

    pc.addEventListener('icecandidate', e => (pc.canTrickleIceCandidates) && sendCandidateToPeer(e.candidate));
