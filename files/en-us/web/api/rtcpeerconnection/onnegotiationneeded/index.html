<p>{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}</p>

<p>The {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}} interface's
  <strong><code>onnegotiationneeded</code></strong> property is an
  {{domxref("EventListener")}} which specifies a function which is called to handle the
  {{event("negotiationneeded")}} event when it occurs on an
  {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}} instance. This event is fired when a change has
  occurred which requires session negotiation. This negotiation should be carried out as
  the offerer, because some session changes cannot be negotiated as the answerer.</p>

<p>Most commonly, the {{event("negotiationneeded")}} event is fired after a send track is
  added to the {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}}. If the session is modified in a manner
  that requires negotiation while a negotiation is already in progress, no
  {{event("negotiationneeded")}} event will fire until negotiation completes, and only
  then if negotiation is still needed.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush: js"><em>RTCPeerConnection</em>.onnegotiationneeded = <em>eventHandler</em>;
</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>This should be set to a function you provide which is passed a single parameter: an
  {{domxref("Event")}} object containing the {{event("negotiationneeded")}} event. There's
  no additional information provided in the event; anything you need, you can get by
  examining the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection#Properties">properties of
    the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code></a>.</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>This example, derived from the example in <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Signaling_and_video_calling">Signaling and video
    calling</a>, establishes a handler for {{event("negotiationneeded")}} events to handle
  creating an offer, configuring the local end of the connection, and sending the offer to
  the remote peer.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">pc.onnegotiationneeded = function() {
  pc.createOffer().then(function(offer) {
    return pc.setLocalDescription(offer);
  })
  .then(function() {
      // Send the offer to the remote peer through the signaling server
    });
  })
  .catch(reportError);
}</pre>

<p>First, it creates the offer by calling {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.createOffer",
  "createOffer()")}}. When that succeeds, the offer is passed into
  {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.setLocalDescription", "setLocalDescription()")}} to set the
  local description for the connection. Once that's succeeded in turn, the offer can be
  sent to the signaling server for delivery to the remote peer.</p>
