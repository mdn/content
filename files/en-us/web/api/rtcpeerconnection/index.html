<p><span class="seoSummary">The <strong><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></strong> interface represents a WebRTC connection between the local computer and a remote peer. It provides methods to connect to a remote peer, maintain and monitor the connection, and close the connection once it's no longer needed.</span></p>

<h3 id="Obsolete_method">Obsolete method</h3>

<p>The following method was obsoleted long ago and was never implemented in all major browsers.</p>

<dl>
 <dt>{{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.createDTMFSender()")}} {{deprecated_inline}}</dt>
 <dd>Creates a new {{domxref("RTCDTMFSender")}}, associated to a specific {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}}, that will be able to send {{Glossary("DTMF")}} phone signaling over the connection.</dd>

<h2 id="Events">Events</h2>

<p>Listen to these events using {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}} or by assigning an event listener to the <code>on<em>eventname</em></code> property of this interface.</p>

 <dt>{{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.icecandidateerror_event", "icecandidateerror")}}</dt>
 <dd>An error of type {{domxref("RTCPeerConnectionIceErrorEvent")}} which is sent to the connection if an error occurred during ICE candidate gathering. The event's properties describe the error.<br>

 Also available using the {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.oniceconnectionstatechange", "oniceconnectionstatechange")}} event handler property.</dd>
 <dt>{{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.icegatheringstatechange_event", "icegatheringstatechange")}}</dt>
 <dd>Sent to the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> when the ICE layer's gathering state, reflected by {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.iceGatheringState", "iceGatheringState")}}, changes.

<h2 id="Constants">Constants</h2>

<h3 id="RTCBundlePolicy_enum">RTCBundlePolicy enum</h3>

<p>The <code>RTCBundlePolicy</code> enum defines string constants which are used to request a specific policy for gathering ICE candidates if the remote peer isn't "BUNDLE-aware" (compatible with the <a href="https://webrtcstandards.info/sdp-bundle/">SDP BUNDLE standard</a> for bundling multiple media streams on a single transport link). All browser implementations are BUNDLE-aware.</p>

<p>If the remote endpoint is BUNDLE-aware, all media tracks and data channels are bundled onto a single transport at the completion of negotiation, regardless of policy used, and any superfluous transports that were created initially are closed at that point.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In technical terms, a BUNDLE lets all media flow between two peers flow across a single <strong>5-tuple</strong>; that is, from a single IP and port on one peer to a single IP and port on the other peer, using the same transport protocol.</p>

  <tr>
   <td><code>"balanced"</code></td>
   <td>The ICE agent initially creates oneÂ {{domxref("RTCDtlsTransport")}} for each type of content added: audio, video, and data channels. If the remote endpoint is not BUNDLE-aware, then each of these DTLS transports then handles all the communication for one type of data.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>"max-compat"</code></td>
   <td>The ICE agent initially creates one {{domxref("RTCDtlsTransport")}} per media track and a separate one for data channels. If the remote endpoint is not BUNDLE-aware, everything is negotiated on these separate DTLS transports.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><code>"max-bundle"</code></td>
   <td>The ICE agent initially creates only a single {{domxref("RTCDtlsTransport")}} to carry all of the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>'s data. If the remote endpoint is not BUNDLE-aware, then only a single track will be negotiated and the rest ignored.</td>
  </tr>

<h3 id="RTCIceConnectionState_enum">RTCIceConnectionState enum</h3>

<p>The <code>RTCIceConnectionState</code> enum defines the string constants used to describe the current state of the ICE agent and its connection to the ICE server (that is, the {{Glossary("STUN")}} or {{Glossary("TURN")}} server).</p>

<h3 id="RTCIceGatheringState_enum">RTCIceGatheringState enum</h3>

<p>The <code>RTCIceGatheringState</code> enum defines string constants which reflect the current status of ICE gathering, as returned using the {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.iceGatheringState")}} property. You can detect when this value changes by watching for an event of type {{event("icegatheringstatechange")}}.</p>

<h3 id="RTCPeerConnectionState_enum">RTCPeerConnectionState enum</h3>

<p>The <code>RTCPeerConnectionState</code> enum defines string constants which describe states in which the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> may be. These values are returned by the {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.connectionState", "connectionState")}} property. This state essentially represents the aggregate state of all ICE transports (which are of type {{domxref("RTCIceTransport")}} or {{domxref("RTCDtlsTransport")}}) being used by the connection.</p>
