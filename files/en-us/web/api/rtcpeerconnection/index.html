<p>The <strong><code>RTCPeerConnection</code></strong> interface represents a WebRTC connection between the local computer and a remote peer. It provides methods to connect to a remote peer, maintain and monitor the connection, and close the connection once it's no longer needed.</p>

<p>The <code>RTCIceGatheringState</code> enum defines string constants which reflect the current status of ICE gathering, as returned using the {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.iceGatheringState")}} property.
