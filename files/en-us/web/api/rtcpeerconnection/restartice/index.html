<p>{{APIRef("WebRTC API")}}</p>

<p><span class="seoSummary">The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API">WebRTC</a> API's
    {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}} interface offers the
    <code><strong>restartIce()</strong></code> method to allow a web application to easily
    request that {{Glossary("ICE")}} candidate gathering be redone on both ends of the
    connection.</span> This simplifies the process by allowing the same method to be used
  by either the caller or the receiver to trigger an ICE restart.</p>

<p>After <code>restartIce()</code> returns, the offer returned by the next call to
  {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.createOffer", "createOffer()")}} is automatically
  configured to trigger ICE restart on both the local peer (once the local peer has been
  set) and on the remote peer, once the offer is sent across your signaling mechanism and
  the remote peer has set its description as well.</p>

<p><code>restartIce()</code> causes the
  {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.negotiationneeded_event", "negotiationneeded")}} event to
  be fired on the <code>RTCPeerConnection</code> to inform the application that it should
  perform negotiation using its signaling channel.</p>

<p>If negotiation fails to complete—either due to rollback or because incoming offers are
  in the process of being negotiated—the {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}} will remember
  that you requested ICE restart. The next time the connection's
  {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.signalingState", "signalingState")}} changes to
  <code>stable</code>, the connection will fire the
  {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.negotiationneeded_event", "negotiationneeded")}} event.
  This process continues until an ICE restart has been successfully completed.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush: js"><em>rtcPeerConnection</em>.restartIce();</pre>

<p>None.</p>

<p><code>undefined</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<p>After calling <code>restartIce()</code>, the next offer created using
  {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.createOffer", "createOffer()")}} will initiate ICE restart
  once sent to the remote peer over your signaling mechanism. Restarting ICE essentially
  resets ICE so that it creates all new candidates using new credentials. Existing media
  transmissions continue uninterrupted during this process.</p>

<p>For details about how ICE restart works, see
  {{SectionOnPage("/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Session_lifetime", "ICE restart")}} and
  {{RFC(5245, "ICE specification", "9.1.1.1")}}.</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>This example creates a handler for the
  {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.iceconnectionstatechange_event",
  "iceconnectionstatechange")}} event that handles a transition to the <code>failed</code>
  state by restarting ICE in order to try again.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">pc.addEventListener("iceconnectionstatechange", event =&gt; {
  if (pc.iceConnectionState === "failed") {
    /* possibly reconfigure the connection in some way here */
    /* then request ICE restart */
    pc.restartIce();
  }
});
</pre>

<p>With this code in place, a transition to the <code>failed</code> state during ICE
  negotiation will cause a {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.negotiationneeded_event",
  "negotiationneeded")}} event to be fired, in response to which your code should
  renegotiate as usual. However, because you have called <code>restartIce()</code>, your
  call to {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.createOffer", "createOffer()")}} which occurs in
  the handler for <code>negotiationneeded</code> will trigger an ICE restart rather than
  just a regular renegotiation.</p>
