{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}

The **`RTCPeerConnection.close()`** method closes the current
peer connection.

## Syntax

```js
peerConnection.close();
```

_This method has no parameters, and returns nothing._

Calling this method terminates the RTCPeerConnection's ICE agent, ending any ongoing
ICE processing and any active streams. This also releases any resources in use by the
ICE agent, including TURN permissions. All {{domxref("RTCRtpSender")}} objects are
considered to be stopped once this returns (they may still be in the process of
stopping, but for all intents and purposes, they're stopped).

Once this method returns, the signaling state as returned by
{{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.signalingState")}} is `closed`.

Make sure that you `delete` all references to theÂ previous
{{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}} before attempting to create a new one that connects
to the same remote peer, as not doing so might result in some errors depending on the
browser.

## Example

```js
var pc = new RTCPeerConnection();
var dc = pc.createDataChannel("my channel");

dc.onmessage = function (event) {
  console.log("received: " + event.data);
  pc.close(); // We decided to close after the first received message
};

dc.onopen = function () {
  console.log("datachannel open");
};

dc.onclose = function () {
  console.log("datachannel close");
};
```
