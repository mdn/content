<p><span class="seoSummary">The {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}} property
    <strong><code>ontrack</code></strong> is an <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Event_handlers">event handler</a> which
    specifies a function to be called when the {{event("track")}} event occurs, indicating
    that a track has been added to the {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}}.</span> The
  function receives as input the event object, of type {{domxref("RTCTrackEvent")}}; this
  event is sent when a new incoming {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} has been created and
  associated with an {{domxref("RTCRtpReceiver")}} object which has been added to the set
  of receivers on connection.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush: js"><em>RTCPeerConnection</em>.ontrack = <em>eventHandler</em>;
</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>Set <code>ontrack</code> to be a function you provide that accepts as input a
  {{domxref("RTCTrackEvent")}} object describing the new track and how it's being used.
  This information includes the {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} object representing the
  new track, the {{domxref("RTCRtpReceiver")}} and {{domxref("RTCRtpTransceiver")}}, and a
  list of {{domxref("MediaStream")}} objects which indicates which stream or streams the
  track is part of..</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>This example, taken from the code for the article <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Signaling_and_video_calling">Signaling and video
    calling</a>, connects the incoming track to the {{HTMLElement("video")}} element which
  will be used to display the incoming video.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">pc.ontrack = function(event) {
  document.getElementById("received_video").srcObject = event.streams[0];
  document.getElementById("hangup-button").disabled = false;
};
</pre>

<p>The first line of our <code>ontrack</code> event handler takes the first stream in the
  incoming track and sets the {{htmlattrxref("srcObject", "video")}} attribute to that.
  This connects that stream of video to the element so that it begins to be presented to
  the user. The second line of code enables a "hang up" button, which the user can use to
  disconnect from the call.</p>
