{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}

The read-only property
**`RTCPeerConnection.currentRemoteDescription`** returns an
{{domxref("RTCSessionDescription")}} object describing the remote end of the connection
as it was most recently successfully negotiated since the last time the
{{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}} finished negotiating and connecting to a remote peer.
Also included is a list of any ICE candidates that may already have been generated by
the ICE agent since the offer or answer represented by the description was first
instantiated.

To change the `currentRemoteDescription`, call
{{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.setRemoteDescription()")}}, which triggers a series of
events which leads to this value being set. For details on what exactly happens and why
the change isn't necessarily instantaneous, see
{{SectionOnPage("/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Connectivity", "Pending and current
  descriptions")}}.

> **Note:** Unlike {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.remoteDescription")}}, this value represents the
> actual current state of the local end of the connection;
> `remoteDescription` may specify a description which the connection is
> currently in the process of switching over to.

## Value

The current description of the remote end of the connection, if one has been set. If
none has been successfully set, this value is `null`.

## Examples

This example looks at the `currentRemoteDescription` and displays an alert
containing the {{domxref("RTCSessionDescription")}} object's `type` and
`sdp` fields.

```js
const pc = new RTCPeerConnection();
// ...
const sd = pc.currentRemoteDescription;
if (sd) {
  alert(`Local session: type='${sd.type}'; sdp description='${sd.sdp}'`);
}
else {
  alert("No local session yet.");
}
```
