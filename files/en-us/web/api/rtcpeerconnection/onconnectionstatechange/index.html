<p><span class="seoSummary">The
    <strong><code>RTCPeerConnection.onconnectionstatechange</code></strong> property
    specifies an <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Event_handlers">event handler</a> which is called to handle the
    {{event("connectionstatechange")}} event when it occurs on an instance of
    {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}}. This happens whenever the aggregate state of the
    connection changes.</span> The aggregate state is a combination of the states of all
  of the individual network transports being used by the connection.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush: js"><em>RTCPeerConnection</em>.onconnectionstatechange = <em>eventHandler</em>;
</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A function which is called by the browser when the {{event("connectionstatechange")}}
  event occurs on the {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}}. The function receives as input a
  single parameter, which is an object of type {{domxref("Event")}}. The event object
  contains no special information of note; you can look at the value of the peer
  connection's {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.connectionState", "connectionState")}}
  property to determine what the new state is.</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<pre class="brush: js">pc.onconnectionstatechange = function(event) {
  switch(pc.connectionState) {
    case "connected":
      // The connection has become fully connected
      break;
    case "disconnected":
    case "failed":
      // One or more transports has terminated unexpectedly or in an error
      break;
    case "closed":
      // The connection has been closed
      break;
  }
