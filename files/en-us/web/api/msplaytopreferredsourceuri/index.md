{{Non-standard_header()}}

**`msPlayToPreferredSourceUri`** is a read/write property which
gets or sets the path to the preferred media source. This enables the _PlayTo_
target device to stream the media content, which can be DRM protected, from a different
location, such as a cloud media server.

This proprietary property is specific to Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.

## Syntax

```js
ptr = object.msPlayToPreferredSourceUri;
```

## Value

**`msPlayToPreferredSourceUri`** enables a _PlayTo_
reference (a URI or URL) for streaming content on the _PlayTo_ target device from
a different location, such as a cloud media server. This enables web pages and Microsoft
Store apps to play Digital Rights Management (DRM) protected content. The app specifies
a preferred Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). This URI can point to a cloud based media
server allowing streaming directly from the cloud, which can be DRM protected, instead
of streaming content from the Windows machine which must be unprotected content.

A forward slash ("/") is appended to the URI string when it is sent over the network to
a _PlayTo_ device. This is done to conform to URI standards.

## Example

```html
  <video src="http://www.contoso.com/videos/video.mp4"
       msPlayToPreferredSourceUri="http://www.contoso.com/catalogid=1234" />
```

```js
  var video = document.createElement('video');
  document.body.appendChild(video);

  video.src = "http://www.contoso.com/videos/video.mp4";
  video.msPlayToPreferredSourceUri = "http://www.contoso.com/catalogid=1234";
```
