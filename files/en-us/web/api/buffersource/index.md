{{APIRef}}

**`BufferSource`** is a typedef used to represent objects that are either themselves an {{jsxref("ArrayBuffer")}}, a {{jsxref("TypedArray)}}, or a {{jsxref("DataView")}}.

This is a helper type to simplify the specification. It isn't an interface and there are no objects implementing it.
