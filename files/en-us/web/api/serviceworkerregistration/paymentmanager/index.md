{{APIRef("Payment Handler API")}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`paymentManager`** property of the
{{domxref("ServiceWorkerRegistration")}} interface returns a payment app's {{domxref("PaymentManager")}} instance, which is used to manage various payment app functionality.

## Value

A {{domxref("PaymentManager")}} object instance.

## Examples

```js
navigator.serviceWorker.register("serviceworker.js").then((registration) => {
  registration.paymentManager.userHint = "Card number should be 16 digits";

  registration.paymentManager
    .enableDelegations(["shippingAddress", "payerName"])
    .then(() => {
      // ...
    });

  // ...
});
```

- {{domxref("PaymentManager.userHint")}} is used to provide a hint for the browser to display along with the payment app's name and icon in the Payment Handler UI.
- {{domxref("PaymentManager.enableDelegations()")}} is used to delegate responsibility for providing various parts of the required payment information to the payment app rather than collecting it from within the merchant website.
