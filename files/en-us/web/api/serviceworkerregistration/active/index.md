{{APIRef("Service Workers API")}}

The **`active`** property of the
{{domxref("ServiceWorkerRegistration")}} interface returns a service worker whose
{{domxref("ServiceWorker.state")}} is `activating` or `activated`.
This property is initially set toÂ `null`.

An active worker controls a {{domxref("Client")}} if the client's URL
falls within the scope of the registration (the `scope` option set when
{{domxref("ServiceWorkerContainer.register")}} is first called.)

> **Note:** This feature is available in [Web Workers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API).

> **Note:** Once an active worker is `activating`, neither a
> runtime script error nor a force termination of the active worker prevents the active
> worker from getting `activated`.

## Syntax

```js
var serviceWorker = serviceWorkerRegistration.active;
```

### Value

A {{domxref("ServiceWorker")}} object's property, if it is currently in an
`activating` or `activated` state.
