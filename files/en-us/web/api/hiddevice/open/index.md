{{securecontext_header}}{{DefaultAPISidebar("WebHID API")}}

The **`open()`** method of the {{domxref("HIDDevice")}} interface requests that the operating sytem opens the HID device.

> **Note:** HID devices are not opened automatically. Therefore, a {{domxref("HIDDevice")}} returned by {{domxref("HID.getRequestDevice()")}} must be opened with this method before it is available to transfer data.

## Syntax

```js
HIDDevice.open();
```

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves with `undefined` once the connection is opened.

### Exceptions

- {{domxref("DOMException")}} `InvalidStateError`
  - : Thrown if the connection is already open.
- {{domxref("DOMException")}} `NotAllowedError`
  - : Thrown if the attempt to open the connection fails for any reason.

## Examples

In the following example, we wait for the HID connection to open before attempting to send or receive data.

```css
await device.open();
```
