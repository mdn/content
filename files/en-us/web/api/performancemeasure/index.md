{{APIRef("User Timing API")}}

**`PerformanceMeasure`** is an _abstract_ interface for {{domxref("PerformanceEntry")}} objects with an {{domxref("PerformanceEntry.entryType","entryType")}} of "`measure`". Entries of this type are created by calling {{domxref("Performance.measure","performance.measure()")}} to add a _named_ {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} (the _measure_) between two _marks_ to the browser's _performance timeline_.

## Properties

This interface has no properties but it extends the following {{domxref("PerformanceEntry")}} properties by qualifying/constrainting the properties as follows:

- {{domxref("PerformanceEntry.entryType")}}
  - : Returns "`measure`".
- {{domxref("PerformanceEntry.name")}}
  - : Returns the name given to the measure when it was created via a call to {{domxref("Performance.measure()","performance.measure()")}}.
- {{domxref("PerformanceEntry.startTime")}}
  - : Returns a {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp","timestamp")}} given to the measure when {{domxref("Performance.measure()","performance.measure()")}} was called.
- {{domxref("PerformanceEntry.duration")}}
  - : Returns a {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} that is the duration of the measure (typically, the measure's end mark timestamp minus its start mark timestamp).

## Methods

This interface has no methods.
