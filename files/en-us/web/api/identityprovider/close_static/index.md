The **`close()`** static method of the {{domxref("IdentityProvider")}} interface provides a manual signal to the browser that an IdP sign-in flow is finished.

## Usage notes

`close()` needs to be called from the same origin as the IdP sign-in dialog, as defined in the [IdP config](/en-US/docs/Web/API/FedCM_API/IDP_integration#provide_a_config_file_and_endpoints).

`close()` is needed to close the IdP sign-in dialog when sign-in is completely finished and the IdP has finished collecting data from the user. A primary use case for `close()` is closing the IdP sign-in dialog in cases where [the browser and the IdP login status become out of sync](/en-US/docs/Web/API/FedCM_API/IDP_integration#what_if_the_browser_and_the_idp_login_status_become_out_of_sync), and the browser initiates a dynamic sign-in flow to correct the issue.
