{{DefaultAPISidebar("WebRTC")}}

**WebRTC** (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that enables Web applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary. The set of standards that comprise WebRTC makes it possible to share data and perform teleconferencing peer-to-peer, without requiring that the user install plug-ins or any other third-party software.

WebRTC consists of several interrelated APIs and protocols which work together to achieve this. The documentation you'll find here will help you understand the fundamentals of WebRTC, how to set up and use both data and media connections, and more.

## Interoperability

Because implementations of WebRTC are still evolving, and because each browser has [different levels of support for codecs](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/WebRTC_codecs) and WebRTC features, you should _strongly_ consider making use of [the Adapter.js library](https://github.com/webrtcHacks/adapter) provided by Google before you begin to write your code.

Adapter.js uses shims and polyfills to smooth over the differences among the WebRTC implementations across the environments supporting it. Adapter.js also handles prefixes and other naming differences to make the entire WebRTC development process easier, with more broadly compatible results. The library is also [available as an NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webrtc-adapter).

To learn more about Adapter.js, see [Improving compatibility using WebRTC adapter.js](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/adapter.js).

## WebRTC concepts and usage

WebRTC serves multiple purposes; together with the [Media Capture and Streams API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Streams_API), they provide powerful multimedia capabilities to the Web, including support for audio and video conferencing, file exchange, screen sharing, identity management, and interfacing with legacy telephone systems including support for sending {{Glossary("DTMF")}} (touch-tone dialing) signals. Connections between peers can be made without requiring any special drivers or plug-ins, and can often be made without any intermediary servers.

Connections between two peers are represented by the {{DOMxRef("RTCPeerConnection")}} interface. Once a connection has been established and opened using `RTCPeerConnection`, media streams ({{DOMxRef("MediaStream")}}s) and/or data channels ({{DOMxRef("RTCDataChannel")}}s) can be added to the connection.

Media streams can consist of any number of tracks of media information; tracks, which are represented by objects based on the {{DOMxRef("MediaStreamTrack")}} interface, may contain one of a number of types of media data, including audio, video, and text (such as subtitles or even chapter names). Most streams consist of at least one audio track and likely also a video track, and can be used to send and receive both live media or stored media information (such as a streamed movie).

You can also use the connection between two peers to exchange arbitrary binary data using the {{DOMxRef("RTCDataChannel")}} interface. This can be used for back-channel information, metadata exchange, game status packets, file transfers, or even as a primary channel for data transfer.

## WebRTC reference

Because WebRTC provides interfaces that work together to accomplish a variety of tasks, we have divided up the reference by category. Please see the sidebar for an alphabetical list.

### Connection setup and management

These interfaces, dictionaries, and types are used to set up, open, and manage WebRTC connections. Included are interfaces representing peer media connections, data channels, and interfaces used when exchanging information on the capabilities of each peer in order to select the best possible configuration for a two-way media connection.

#### Interfaces

- {{DOMxRef("RTCPeerConnection")}}
  - : Represents a WebRTC connection between the local computer and a remote peer. It is used to handle efficient streaming of data between the two peers.
- {{DOMxRef("RTCDataChannel")}}
  - : Represents a bi-directional data channel between two peers of a connection.
- {{DOMxRef("RTCDataChannelEvent")}}
  - : Represents events that occur while attaching a {{DOMxRef("RTCDataChannel")}} to a {{DOMxRef("RTCPeerConnection")}}. The only event sent with this interface is {{event("datachannel")}}.

  - : Represents the parameters of a session. Each `RTCSessionDescription` consists of a description {{DOMxRef("RTCSessionDescription.type", "type")}} indicating which part of the offer/answer negotiation process it describes and of the {{Glossary("SDP")}} descriptor of the session.
- {{DOMxRef("RTCStatsReport")}}
  - : Provides information detailing statistics for a connection or for an individual track on the connection; the report can be obtained by calling {{DOMxRef("RTCPeerConnection.getStats()")}}. Details about using WebRTC statistics can be found in [WebRTC Statistics API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_Statistics_API).

- {{DOMxRef("RTCSctpTransport")}}
  - : Provides information which describes a Stream Control Transmission Protocol (**{{Glossary("SCTP")}}**) transport and also provides a way to access the underlying Datagram Transport Layer Security (**{{Glossary("DTLS")}}**) transport over which SCTP packets for all of an [`RTCPeerConnection`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCPeerConnection "The RTCPeerConnection interface represents a WebRTC connection between the local computer and a remote peer. It provides methods to connect to a remote peer, maintain and monitor the connection, and close the connection once it's no longer needed.")'s data channels are sent and received.

- {{DOMxRef("RTCCertificate")}}
  - : Represents a certificate that an {{DOMxRef("RTCPeerConnection")}} uses to authenticate.

### Telephony

These interfaces and events are related to interactivity with Public-Switched Telephone Networks (PTSNs). They're primarily used to send tone dialing sounds—or packets representing those tones—across the network to the remote peer.

#### Interfaces

  - : Manages the encoding and transmission of Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency ({{Glossary("DTMF")}}) signaling for an {{DOMxRef("RTCPeerConnection")}}.
- {{DOMxRef("RTCDTMFToneChangeEvent")}}
  - : Used by the {{domxref("RTCDTMFSender.tonechange_event", "tonechange")}} event to indicate that a DTMF tone has either begun or ended. This event does not bubble (except where otherwise stated) and is not cancelable (except where otherwise stated).

#### Events

- {{domxref("RTCDTMFSender.tonechange_event", "tonechange")}}
  - : Either a new {{Glossary("DTMF")}} tone has begun to play over the connection, or the last tone in the `RTCDTMFSender`'s {{domxref("RTCDTMFSender.toneBuffer", "toneBuffer")}} has been sent and the buffer is now empty. The event's type is {{domxref("RTCDTMFToneChangeEvent")}}.
