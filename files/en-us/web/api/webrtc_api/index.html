<p><span class="seoSummary"><strong>WebRTC</strong> (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology which enables Web applications and sites to capture and optionally stream audio and/or video media, as well as to exchange arbitrary data between browsers without requiring an intermediary.</span> The set of standards that comprise WebRTC makes it possible to share data and perform teleconferencing peer-to-peer, without requiring that the user install plug-ins or any other third-party software.</p>

<p>WebRTC consists of several interrelated APIs and protocols which work together to achieve this. The documentation you'll find here will help you understand the fundamentals of WebRTC, how to set up and use both data and media connections, and more.</p>

<h2 id="Interoperability">Interoperability</h2>

<p>Because implementations of WebRTC are still evolving, and because each browser has <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/WebRTC_codecs">different levels of support for codecs</a> and WebRTC features, you should <em>strongly</em> consider making use of <a href="https://github.com/webrtcHacks/adapter">the Adapter.js library</a> provided by Google before you begin to write your code.</p>

<p>Adapter.js uses shims and polyfills to smooth over the differences among the WebRTC implementations across the environments supporting it. Adapter.js also handles prefixes and other naming differences to make the entire WebRTC development process easier, with more broadly compatible results. The library is also <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/webrtc-adapter">available as an NPM package</a>.</p>

<p>To learn more about Adapter.js, see <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/adapter.js">Improving compatibility using WebRTC adapter.js</a>.</p>

<h2 id="WebRTC_concepts_and_usage">WebRTC concepts and usage</h2>

<p>WebRTC serves multiple purposes; together with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Streams_API">Media Capture and Streams API</a>, they provide powerful multimedia capabilities to the Web, including support for audio and video conferencing, file exchange, screen sharing, identity management, and interfacing with legacy telephone systems including support for sending {{Glossary("DTMF")}} (touch-tone dialing) signals. Connections between peers can be made without requiring any special drivers or plug-ins, and can often be made without any intermediary servers.</p>

<p>Connections between two peers are represented by the {{DOMxRef("RTCPeerConnection")}} interface. Once a connection has been established and opened using <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>, media streams ({{DOMxRef("MediaStream")}}s) and/or data channels ({{DOMxRef("RTCDataChannel")}}s) can be added to the connection.</p>

<p>Media streams can consist of any number of tracks of media information; tracks, which are represented by objects based on the {{DOMxRef("MediaStreamTrack")}} interface, may contain one of a number of types of media data, including audio, video, and text (such as subtitles or even chapter names). Most streams consist of at least one audio track and likely also a video track, and can be used to send and receive both live media or stored media information (such as a streamed movie).</p>

<p>You can also use the connection between two peers to exchange arbitrary binary data using the {{DOMxRef("RTCDataChannel")}} interface. This can be used for back-channel information, metadata exchange, game status packets, file transfers, or even as a primary channel for data transfer.</p>

<h2 id="WebRTC_reference">WebRTC reference</h2>

<p>Because WebRTC provides interfaces that work together to accomplish a variety of tasks, we have divided up the reference by category. Please see the sidebar for an alphabetical list.</p>

<h3 id="Connection_setup_and_management">Connection setup and management</h3>

<p>These interfaces, dictionaries, and types are used to set up, open, and manage WebRTC connections. Included are interfaces representing peer media connections, data channels, and interfaces used when exchanging information on the capabilities of each peer in order to select the best possible configuration for a two-way media connection.</p>
