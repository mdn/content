## Browser Differences

Netscape 7.x (all platforms) and Internet Explorer 6 (Windows) support the W3C XSLT 1.0 standard ([http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt](https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt)). IE 5.0 and 5.5 (both Windows) supported only the working draft of XSLT, and thus are not compatible with XSLT 1.0 stylesheets. Netscape 6.x only partially supported XSLT 1.0.
