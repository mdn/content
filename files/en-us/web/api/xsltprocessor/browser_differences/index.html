<p>Netscape 7.x (all platforms) and Internet Explorer 6 (Windows) support the W3C XSLT 1.0 standard (<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt">http://www.w3.org/TR/xslt</a>). IE 5.0 and 5.5 (both Windows) supported only the working draft of XSLT, and thus are not compatible with XSLT 1.0 stylesheets. Netscape 6.x only partially supported XSLT 1.0.</p>
