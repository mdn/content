{{SeeCompatTable}}{{APIRef("Keyboard API")}}

The **`entries()`** method of the {{domxref("KeyboardLayoutMap")}} interface returns a new [Iterator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Iterator) object that contains the `[key, value]` pairs, in the same order as that provided by a {{jsxref("Statements/for...in", "for...in")}} loop (the difference being that a `for-in` loop enumerates properties in the prototype chain as well).

## Value

A new [Iterator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Iterator) object.
