<div class="summary">
<p>Developing a web application that uses <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events">server-sent events</a> is straightforward. You'll need a bit of code on the server to stream events to the front-end, but the client side code works almost identically to <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">websockets</a> in part of handling incoming events. This is one-way connection, so you can't send events from a client to a server.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Receiving_events_from_the_server">Receiving events from the server</h2>

<p>The server-sent event API is contained in the {{domxref("EventSource")}} interface; to open a connection to the server to begin receiving events from it, create a new <code>EventSource</code> object with the URL of a script that generates the events. For example:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">const evtSource = new EventSource("ssedemo.php");</pre>

<p>If the event generator script is hosted on a different origin, a new <code>EventSource</code> object should be created with both the URL and an options dictionary. For example, assuming the client script is on <code>example.com</code>:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">const evtSource = new EventSource("//api.example.com/ssedemo.php", { withCredentials: true } );</pre>

<p>Once you've instantiated your event source, you can begin listening for messages from the server by attaching a handler for the {{event("message")}} event:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">evtSource.onmessage = function(event) {
  const newElement = document.createElement("li");
  const eventList = document.getElementById("list");

  newElement.textContent = "message: " + event.data;
  eventList.appendChild(newElement);
}
</pre>

<p>This code listens for incoming messages (that is, notices from the server that do not have an <code>event</code> field on them) and appends the message text to a list in the document's HTML.</p>

<p>You can also listen for events with <code>addEventListener()</code>:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">evtSource.addEventListener("ping", function(event) {
  const newElement = document.createElement("li");
  const time = JSON.parse(event.data).time;
  newElement.textContent = "ping at " + time;
  eventList.appendChild(newElement);
});
</pre>

<p>This code is similar, except that it will be called automatically whenever the server sends a message with the <code>event</code> field set to "ping"; it then parses the JSON in the <code>data</code> field and outputs that information.</p>

<div class="notecard warning">
<p>When <strong>not used over HTTP/2</strong>, SSE suffers from a limitation to the maximum number of open connections, which can be especially painful when opening multiple tabs, as the limit is <em>per browser</em> and is set to a very low number (6). The issue has been marked as "Won't fix" in <a href="https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=275955" rel="noreferrer">Chrome</a> and <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=906896" rel="noreferrer">Firefox</a>. This limit is per browser + domain, which means that you can open 6 SSE connections across all of the tabs to <code>www.example1.com</code> and another 6 SSE connections to <code>www.example2.com</code> (per <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/5326159/1905229">Stackoverflow</a>). When using HTTP/2, the maximum number of simultaneous <em>HTTP streams</em> is negotiated between the server and the client (defaults to 100).</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Sending_events_from_the_server">Sending events from the server</h2>

<p>The server-side script that sends events needs to respond using the MIME type <code>text/event-stream</code>. Each notification is sent as a block of text terminated by a pair of newlines. For details on the format of the event stream, see {{ anch("Event stream format") }}.</p>

<p>The {{Glossary("PHP")}} code for the example we're using here follows:</p>

<pre class="brush: php">date_default_timezone_set("America/New_York");
header("Cache-Control: no-cache");
header("Content-Type: text/event-stream");

$counter = rand(1, 10);
while (true) {
  // Every second, send a "ping" event.

  echo "event: ping\n";
  $curDate = date(DATE_ISO8601);
  echo 'data: {"time": "' . $curDate . '"}';
  echo "\n\n";

  // Send a simple message at random intervals.

  $counter--;

  if (!$counter) {
    echo 'data: This is a message at time ' . $curDate . "\n\n";
    $counter = rand(1, 10);
  }

  ob_end_flush();
  flush();

  // Break the loop if the client aborted the connection (closed the page)

  if ( connection_aborted() ) break;

  sleep(1);
}
</pre>

<p>The code above generates an event every second, with the event type "ping". Each event's data is a JSON object containing the ISO 8601 timestamp corresponding to the time at which the event was generated. At random intervals, a simple message (with no event type) is sent.<br>
 The loop will keep running independent of the connection status, so a check is included<br>
 to break the loop if the connection has been closed (e.g. client closes the page).</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You can find a full example that uses the code shown in this article on GitHub — see <a href="https://github.com/mdn/dom-examples/tree/master/server-sent-events">Simple SSE demo using PHP.</a></p>
</div>

<h2 id="Error_handling">Error handling</h2>

<p>When problems occur (such as a network timeout or issues pertaining to <a href="/en-US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS">access control</a>), an error event is generated. You can take action on this programmatically by implementing the <code>onerror</code> callback on the <code>EventSource</code> object:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">evtSource.onerror = function(err) {
  console.error("EventSource failed:", err);
};
</pre>

<h2 id="Closing_event_streams">Closing event streams</h2>

<p>By default, if the connection between the client and server closes, the connection is restarted. The connection is terminated with the <code>.close()</code> method.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">evtSource.close();</pre>

<h2 id="Event_stream_format">Event stream format</h2>

<p>The event stream is a simple stream of text data which must be encoded using <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/UTF-8">UTF-8</a>. Messages in the event stream are separated by a pair of newline characters. A colon as the first character of a line is in essence a comment, and is ignored.</p>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The comment line can be used to prevent connections from timing out; a server can send a comment periodically to keep the connection alive.</div>

<p>Each message consists of one or more lines of text listing the fields for that message. Each field is represented by the field name, followed by a colon, followed by the text data for that field's value.</p>

<h3 id="Fields">Fields</h3>

<p>Each message received has some combination of the following fields, one per line:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><code>event</code></dt>
 <dd>A string identifying the type of event described. If this is specified, an event will be dispatched on the browser to the listener for the specified event name; the website source code should use <code>addEventListener()</code> to listen for named events. The <code>onmessage</code> handler is called if no event name is specified for a message.</dd>
 <dt><code>data</code></dt>
 <dd>The data field for the message. When the <code>EventSource</code> receives multiple consecutive lines that begin with <code>data:</code>, <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/#dispatchMessage">it concatenates them</a>, inserting a newline character between each one. Trailing newlines are removed.</dd>
 <dt><code>id</code></dt>
 <dd>The event ID to set the <a href="/en-US/docs/Server-sent_events/EventSource"><code>EventSource</code></a> object's last event ID value.</dd>
 <dt><code>retry</code></dt>
 <dd>The reconnection time to use when attempting to send the event. This must be an integer, specifying the reconnection time in milliseconds. If a non-integer value is specified, the field is ignored.</dd>
</dl>

<p>All other field names are ignored.</p>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If a line doesn't contain a colon, the entire line is treated as the field name with an empty value string.</div>

<h3 id="Examples">Examples</h3>

<h4 id="Data-only_messages">Data-only messages</h4>

<p>In the following example, there are three messages sent. The first is just a comment, since it starts with a colon character. As mentioned previously, this can be useful as a keep-alive mechanism if messages might not be sent regularly.</p>

<p>The second message contains a data field with the value "some text". The third message contains a data field with the value "another message\nwith two lines". Note the newline special character in the value.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">: this is a test stream

data: some text

data: another message
data: with two lines
</pre>

<h4 id="Named_events">Named events</h4>

<p>This example sends named events. Each has an event name specified by the <code>event</code> field, and a <code>data</code> field whose value is an appropriate JSON string with the data needed for the client to act on the event. The <code>data</code> field could, of course, have any string data; it doesn't have to be JSON.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">event: userconnect
data: {"username": "bobby", "time": "02:33:48"}

event: usermessage
data: {"username": "bobby", "time": "02:34:11", "text": "Hi everyone."}

event: userdisconnect
data: {"username": "bobby", "time": "02:34:23"}

event: usermessage
data: {"username": "sean", "time": "02:34:36", "text": "Bye, bobby."}
</pre>

<h4 id="Mixing_and_matching">Mixing and matching</h4>

<p>You don't have to use just unnamed messages or typed events; you can mix them together in a single event stream.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash">event: userconnect
data: {"username": "bobby", "time": "02:33:48"}

data: Here's a system message of some kind that will get used
data: to accomplish some task.

event: usermessage
data: {"username": "bobby", "time": "02:34:11", "text": "Hi everyone."}</pre>
