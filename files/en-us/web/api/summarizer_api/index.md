{{SeeCompatTable}}{{DefaultAPISidebar("Summarizer API")}}

The **Summarizer API** summarizes a given body of text via a browser's internal AI model (which may differ between browsers).

## Concepts and usage

Writing a summary of a larger body of text is a common writing task, and one that AI is well-suited to. Typical use cases include:

- Providing a summary of a full article so the reader can judge whether to read the whole thing.
- Summarizing a meeting transcript so those joining the meeting late can get up to speed with what they've missed.
- Summarizing a set of product reviews to quickly communicate overall sentiment.

The Summarizer API provides an asynchronous ({{jsxref("Promise")}}-based) mechanism for a website to feed a body of text into the browser's own internal AI model and request that it returns a summary of the text based on specified options.

This is done using the functionality made available by the {{domxref("Summarizer")}} interface, in a two-step process:

1. Create a `Summarizer` object instance using the {{domxref("Summarizer.create_static", "Summarizer.create()")}} static method, specifying options for what kind of summary you want written. Options include length, type (for example, "tldr" or key points), format (plain text or markdown), and input and output languages.
   > [!NOTE]
   > If you want to check whether the browser AI model is able to support your preferences, you can do so with the {{domxref("Summarizer.availability_static", "Summarizer.availability()")}} static method.
2. Run the {{domxref("Summarizer.summarize()")}} instance method to request the summary.

After a `Summarizer` instance has been created, you can remove it again using the {{domxref("Summarizer.destroy()")}} instance method. You can also cancel a pending `create()` or `summarize()` operation using an {{domxref("AbortController")}}.

See [Using the Summarizer API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Summarizer_API/Using) for a walkthrough of how the API works.

## Interfaces

- {{domxref("Summarizer")}} {{Experimental_Inline}}
  - : Contains all the functionality for the Summarizer API, including checking AI model availability, creating a new `Summarizer` instance, using it to generate a new summary, and more.

## HTTP headers

- {{httpheader("Permissions-Policy")}}; the {{httpheader('Permissions-Policy/summarizer','summarizer')}} directive
  - : Controls access to the Summarizer API. Where a policy specifically disallows the use of the Summarizer API, any attempts to call the API's methods will fail with a `NotAllowedError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}.

## Security considerations

The specification requires that a user has recently interacted with the page when creating `Summarizer` objects ([transient user activation](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/User_activation) is required).

In addition, the specification controls access to the API via {{httpheader('Permissions-Policy/summarizer','summarizer')}} {{httpheader("Permissions-Policy")}} directives.
