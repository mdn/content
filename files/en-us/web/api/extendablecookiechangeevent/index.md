{{securecontext_header}}{{APIRef("Cookie Store API")}}{{AvailableInWorkers("service")}}

The **`ExtendableCookieChangeEvent`** interface of the {{domxref("Cookie Store API", "", "", "nocode")}} is the event type passed to {{domxref("ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/cookiechange_event", "cookiechange")}} event fired at the {{domxref("ServiceWorkerGlobalScope")}} when any cookie changes occur which match the service worker's cookie change subscription list. A cookie change event consists of a cookie and a type. (either "changed" or "deleted")

Cookie changes that cause the `ExtendableCookieChangeEvent` to be dispatched are:

- A cookie is newly created and not immediately removed. In this case `type` is "changed".
- A cookie is newly created and immediately removed. In this case `type` is "deleted"
- A cookie is removed. In this case `type` is "deleted".

> **Note:** A cookie that is replaced due to the insertion of another cookie with the same name, domain, and path, is ignored and does not trigger a change event.

## Constructor

- {{domxref("ExtendableCookieChangeEvent.ExtendableCookieChangeEvent", "ExtendableCookieChangeEvent()")}}
  - : Creates a new `ExtendableCookieChangeEvent`.

## Instance properties

_This interface also inherits properties from {{domxref("ExtendableEvent")}}._

- {{domxref("ExtendableCookieChangeEvent.changed")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Returns an array containing the changed cookies.
- {{domxref("ExtendableCookieChangeEvent.deleted")}} {{ReadOnlyInline}}
  - : Returns an array containing the deleted cookies.

## Instance methods

_This interface also inherits methods from {{domxref("ExtendableEvent")}}._

## Examples

In the below example, we use {{domxref("CookieStoreManager.getSubscriptions()")}} to get a list of existing subscriptions. (In service workers, a subscription is required in order to listen for events.) We unsubscribe from existing subscriptions using {{domxref("CookieStoreManager.unsubscribe()")}}, then subscribe to the cookie with a name of 'COOKIE_NAME' using {{domxref("CookieStoreManager.subscribe()")}}. If that cookie is changed, the event listener logs the event to the console. This will be an `ExtendableCookieChangeEvent` object, with the {{domxref("ExtendableCookieChangeEvent.changed","changed")}} or {{domxref("ExtendableCookieChangeEvent.deleted","deleted")}} property containing the modified cookie.

```js
self.addEventListener("activate", (event) => {
  event.waitUntil(async () => {
    const subscriptions = await self.registration.cookies.getSubscriptions();

    await self.registration.cookies.unsubscribe(subscriptions);

    await self.registration.cookies.subscribe([
      {
        name: "COOKIE_NAME",
      },
    ]);
  });
});

self.addEventListener("cookiechange", (event) => {
  console.log(event);
});
```
