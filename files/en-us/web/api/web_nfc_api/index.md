The Web NFC API allows exchanging data over NFC via light-weight NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) messages.

> **Note:** Devices and tags have to be formatted and recorded specifically to support NDEF record format to be used with Web NFC. Low-level operations are currently not supported by the API, however there is a public discussion about API that would add such functionality.

## Interfaces

- {{DOMxRef("NDEFMessage")}}
  - : Interface that represents NDEF messages that can be received from or sent to a compatible tag via a `NDEFReader` object. A message is composed of metadata and NDEF Records.
- {{DOMxRef("NDEFReader")}} {{Experimental_Inline}}
  - : Interface that enables reading and writing messages from compatible NFC tags. The messages are represented as `NDEFMessage` objects.
- {{DOMxRef("NDEFRecord")}}
