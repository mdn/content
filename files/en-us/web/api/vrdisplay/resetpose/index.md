{{APIRef("WebVR API")}}{{deprecated_header}}

The **`resetPose()`** method of the {{domxref("VRDisplay")}} interface resets the pose for the `VRDisplay`, treating its current {{domxref("VRPose.position")}} and {{domxref("VRPose.orientation")}} as the "origin/zero" values.

> **Note:** This method was part of the old [WebVR API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/). It has been superseded by the [WebXR Device API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/).

After `resetPost()` has been called, future poses returned from {{domxref("VRDisplay.getPose()")}}/{{domxref("VRDisplay.getImmediatePose()")}} will describe positions relative to the `VRDisplay`'s position when `resetPose()` was last called and will treat the display’s yaw when `resetPose()` was last called as the forward orientation.

The VRDisplay's reported roll and pitch do not change when `resetPose()` is called as they are relative to gravity. Calling `resetPose()` may change the {{domxref("VRStageParameters.sittingToStandingTransform")}} matrix.

## Syntax

```js
vrDisplayInstance.resetPose();
```

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

Void.

## Examples

```js
// Assuming vrDisplay already contains a VRDisplay object,
// and we have a <button> referenced inside btn
btn.addEventListener('click', function() {
  vrDisplay.resetPose();
  console.log('Current pose set as origin/center');
});
```

## Specifications

This method was part of the old [WebVR API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webvr/spec/1.1/) that has been superseded by the [WebXR Device API](https://immersive-web.github.io/webxr/). It is no longer on track to becoming a standard.

Until all browsers have implemented the new [WebXR APIs](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebXR_Device_API/Fundamentals), it is recommended to rely on frameworks, like [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/), [Babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/), or [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), or a [polyfill](https://github.com/immersive-web/webxr-polyfill), to develop WebXR applications that will work across all browsers [\[1\]](https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/oculus-browser/browser-vr-xr/).
