{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}

The **`RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats`** dictionary of the [WebRTC API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) is used to report statistics from a remote endpoint about its outbound RTP stream.
This will correspond to an inbound stream that is currently being received by the local {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}} object.

The statistics can be obtained by iterating the {{domxref("RTCStatsReport")}} returned by {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.getStats()")}} until you find a report with the [`type`](#type) of `remote-outbound-rtp`.

## Instance properties

### Remote outbound specific statistics

- {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.localId", "localId")}} {{optional_inline}}
  - : A string which is used to find the local {{domxref("RTCInboundRtpStreamStats")}} object that shares the same [synchronization source (SSRC)](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats/ssrc).
- {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.remoteTimestamp", "remoteTimestamp")}} {{optional_inline}}
  - : A {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} specifying the timestamp (on the remote device) at which the statistics in the `RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats` object were sent by the remote endpoint. This is different from the {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.timestamp", "timestamp")}}; it represents the time at which the object's statistics were received or generated by the local endpoint.
- `reportsSent` {{optional_inline}} {{experimental_inline}}
  - : A positive integer indicating the total number of {{glossary("RTCP")}} Sender Report (SR) blocks sent for this [synchronization source (SSRC)](#ssrc).
- {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.roundTripTimeMeasurements", "roundTripTimeMeasurements")}} {{optional_inline}} {{experimental_inline}}
  - : A positive number that represents the total number of valid round trip time measurements received for this [synchronization source (SSRC)](#ssrc).
- {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.totalRoundTripTime", "totalRoundTripTime")}} {{optional_inline}} {{experimental_inline}}
  - : A number indicating the cumulative sum of all round trip time measurements since the beginning of the session, in seconds.
    The average round trip time can be computed by dividing `totalRoundTripTime` by [`roundTripTimeMeasurements`](#roundtriptimemeasurements).

### Sent RTP stream statistics

<!-- RTCSentRtpStreamStats -->

- `bytesSent` {{optional_inline}}
  - : A positive integer indicating the total number of bytes sent for this SSRC, including retransmissions. <!-- [RFC3550] section 6.4.1 -->
- `packetsSent` {{optional_inline}}
  - : A positive integer indicating the total number of RTP packets sent for this SSRC, including retransmissions. <!-- [RFC3550] section 6.4.1 -->

### Common RTP stream statistics

<!-- RTCRtpStreamStats -->

- {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.codecId", "codecId")}} {{optional_inline}}
  - : A string that uniquely identifies the object that was inspected to produce the {{domxref("RTCCodecStats")}} report associated with this {{Glossary("RTP")}} stream.
- {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.kind", "kind")}}
  - : A string indicating whether the {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} associated with the stream is an audio or a video track.
- {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.ssrc", "ssrc")}}
  - : A positive integer that identifies the synchronization source (SSRC) of the RTP packets in this stream.
- {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.transportId", "transportId")}} {{optional_inline}}
  - : A string that uniquely identifies the object that was inspected to produce the {{domxref("RTCTransportStats")}} report associated with this RTP stream.

### Common instance properties

The following properties are common to all WebRTC statistics objects.

<!-- RTCStats -->

- {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.id", "id")}}
  - : A string that uniquely identifies the object that is being monitored to produce this set of statistics.
- {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.timestamp", "timestamp")}}
  - : A {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} object indicating the time at which the sample was taken for this statistics object.
- {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.type", "type")}}
  - : A string with the value `"remote-outbound-rtp"`, indicating the type of statistics that the object contains.

## Usage notes

The `RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats` object's {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.remoteTimestamp", "remoteTimestamp")}} property provides statistics based on the received data's NTP timestamp taken from an {{Glossary("RTCP")}} Sender Report (SR) block.
Be aware that the remote clock may not be synchronized with the local clock (either in current time or speed at which time elapses).
