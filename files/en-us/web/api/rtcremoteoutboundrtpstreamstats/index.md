{{DefaultAPISidebar("WebRTC")}}

The **`RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats`** dictionary of the [WebRTC API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) is used to report statistics for the remote endpoint's outbound RTP stream corresponding to an inbound stream that is currently received by an {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}} object.

The statistics can be obtained by iterating the {{domxref("RTCStatsReport")}} returned by {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.getStats()")}} until you find a report with the [`type`](#type) of `remote-outbound-rtp`.

## Instance properties

_In addition to the properties defined by {{domxref("RTCSentRtpStreamStats")}} and its underlying {{domxref("RTCRtpStreamStats")}} dictionary, `RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats` defines the following properties._

- {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.localId", "localId")}}
  - : A string which is used to find the local {{domxref("RTCInboundRtpStreamStats")}} object which shares the same Synchronization Source (SSRC).
- {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.remoteTimestamp", "remoteTimestamp")}}
  - : A {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} specifying the timestamp (on the remote device) at which the statistics in the `RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats` object were sent by the remote endpoint. This is different from the {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.timestamp", "timestamp")}}; it represents the time at which the object's statistics were received or generated by the local endpoint.

### Common instance properties

The following properties are common to all WebRTC statistics objects.

<!-- RTCStats -->

- {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.id", "id")}}
  - : A string that uniquely identifies the object that is being monitored to produce this set of statistics.
- {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.timestamp", "timestamp")}}
  - : A {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} object indicating the time at which the sample was taken for this statistics object.
- {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.type", "type")}}
  - : A string with the value `"remote-outbound-rtp"`, indicating the type of statistics that the object contains.

## Usage notes

The `RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats` object's {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.remoteTimestamp", "remoteTimestamp")}} property provides statistics based on the received data's NTP timestamp taken from an {{Glossary("RTCP")}} Sender Report (SR) block.
Be aware that the remote clock may not be synchronized with the local clock (either in current time or speed at which time elapses).
