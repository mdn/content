The **`CDATASection`** interface represents a CDATA section
that can be used within XML to include extended portions of unescaped text. The symbols
`<` and `&` donâ€™t need escaping as they normally do when
inside a CDATA section.

In XML, a CDATA section looks like:

```js
<![CDATA[ ... ]]>
```

For example:

```xml
<foo>Here is a CDATA section: <![CDATA[ < > & ]]> with all kinds of unescaped text.</foo>
```

The only sequence which is not allowed within a CDATA section is the closing sequence
of a CDATA section itself, `]]>`:

```xml
<![CDATA[ ]]> will cause an error ]]>
```

Note that CDATA sections should not be used within HTML; they only work in XML.
