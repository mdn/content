{{APIRef("Device Orientation Events")}}

The **`acceleration`** property returns the amount of acceleration recorded by
the device, in [meters per second squared (m/sÂ²)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_per_second_squared).
The acceleration value does not include the effect of
the gravity force, in contrast to {{DOMxRef("DeviceMotionEvent.accelerationIncludingGravity")}}.

> **Note:** If the hardware doesn't know how to remove gravity from the
> acceleration data, this value may not be present in the
> {{DOMxRef("DeviceMotionEvent")}}. In this situation, you'll need to use
> {{DOMxRef("DeviceMotionEvent.accelerationIncludingGravity")}} instead.

## Value

The `acceleration` property is an object providing information about
acceleration on three axis. Each axis is represented with its own property:

- `x`
  - : Represents the acceleration upon the x axis which is the west to east axis
- `y`
  - : Represents the acceleration upon the y axis which is the south to north axis
- `z`
  - : Represents the acceleration upon the z axis which is the down to up axis
