{{APIRef("Websockets API")}}

The **`code`** read-only property of the {{domxref("CloseEvent")}} interface returns a [WebSocket connection close code](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455.html#section-7.1.5) indicating the reason the server gave for closing the connection.

## Value

An integer [WebSocket connection close code](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6455.html#section-7.1.5) in the range `1000`-`4999`, indicating the reason the server gave for closing the connection.

        The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid
