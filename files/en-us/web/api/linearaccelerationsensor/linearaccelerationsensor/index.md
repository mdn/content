{{APIRef("Sensor API")}}

The **`LinearAccelerationSensor()`**
constructor creates a new {{domxref("LinearAccelerationSensor")}} object which
provides on each reading the acceleration applied to the device along all three axes,
but without the contribution of gravity.

If a feature policy blocks use of a feature, it is because your code is inconsistent
with the policies set on your server. This is not something that would ever be shown to
a user. The {{httpheader('Feature-Policy')}} HTTP header article contains implementation instructions.

## Syntax

```js
var linearAccelerationSensor = new LinearAccelerationSensor([options])
```

### Parameters

- _options_ {{optional_inline}}

  - : Options are as follows:

    - `frequency`: The desired number of times per second a sample should
      be taken, meaning the number of times per second that
      {{domxref('sensor.onreading')}} will be called. A whole number or decimal may be
      used, the latter for frequencies less than a second. The actual reading frequency
      depends on device hardware and consequently may be less than requested.
    - `referenceFrame`: Either `'device'` or
      `'screen'`. The default is `'device'`.
