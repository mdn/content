{{APIRef("Web Audio API")}}

The **`process()`**
method of an {{domxref("AudioWorkletProcessor")}}-derived class implements the audio
processing algorithm for the audio processor worklet.

Although the method is
not a part of the {{domxref("AudioWorkletProcessor")}} interface, any implementation
of `AudioWorkletProcessor` must provide a `process()` method.

The method is called synchronously from the audio rendering thread, once for each block
of audio (also known as a rendering quantum) being directed through the processor's
corresponding {{domxref("AudioWorkletNode")}}. In other words, every time a new block of
audio is ready for your processor to manipulate, your `process()` function is
invoked to do so.

> **Note:** Currently, audio data blocks are always 128 frames
> long—that is, they contain 128 32-bit floating-point samples for each of the inputs'
> channels. However, plans are already in place to revise the specification to allow the
> size of the audio blocks to be changed depending on circumstances (for example, if the
> audio hardware or CPU utilization is more efficient with larger block sizes).
> Therefore, you *must always check the size of the sample array* rather than
> assuming a particular size.
>
> This size may even be allowed to change over time, so you mustn't look at just the
> first block and assume the sample buffers will always be the same size.

## Syntax

```js
var isActivelyProcessing = audioWorkletProcessor.process(inputs, outputs, parameters);
```

### Parameters

- `inputs`

  - : An array of _inputs_ connected to the node, each item of which is, in turn,
    an array of _channels_. Each _channel_ is a {{jsxref("Float32Array")}}
    containing 128 samples. For example, `inputs[n][m][i]` will access
    _n_-th input, _m_-th channel of that input, and _i_-th sample
    of that channel.

    Each sample value is in range of `[-1 .. 1]`.

    The number of _inputs_ and thus the length of that array is fixed at the
    construction of the node (see {{domxref("AudioWorkletNode")}}). If there is
    no active node connected to the _n_-th input of the node,
    `inputs[n]` will be an empty array (zero input channels available).

    The number of _channels_ in each input may vary, depending on
    {{domxref("AudioNode.channelCount", "channelCount")}} and
    {{domxref("AudioNode.channelCountMode", "channelCountMode")}} properties.

- `outputs`
  - : An array of _outputs_ that is similar to the `inputs` parameter in
    structure. It is intended to be filled during the execution of the
    `process()` method. Each of the output channels is filled with zeros by
    default — the processor will output silence unless the output arrays are modified.
- `parameters`

  - : An object containing string keys and {{jsxref("Float32Array")}} values. For each
    custom {{domxref("AudioParam")}} defined using the
    {{domxref("AudioWorkletProcessor.parameterDescriptors", "parameterDescriptors")}}
    getter, the key in the object is a `name` of that
    {{domxref("AudioParam")}}, and the value is a {{jsxref("Float32Array")}}. The values
    of the array are calculated by taking scheduled automation events into
    consideration.

    If the automation rate of the parameter is
    [`"a-rate"`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioParam#a-rate), the array
    will contain 128 values — one for each frame in the current audio block. If there's
    no automation happening during the time represented by the current block, the array
    may contain a single value that is constant for the entire block, instead of 128
    identical values.

    If the automation rate is
    [`"k-rate"`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioParam#k-rate), the array
    will contain a single value, which is to be used for each of 128 frames.

### Return value

A Boolean value indicating whether or not to force the {{domxref("AudioWorkletNode")}}
to remain active even if the {{Glossary("user agent", "user agent's")}} internal logic
would otherwise decide that it's safe to shut down the node.

The returned value lets your processor have influence over the lifetime policy of
the {{domxref("AudioWorkletProcessor")}} and the node that owns it. If the combination
of the return value and the state of the node causes the browser to decide to stop the
node, `process()` will not be called again.

Returning `true` forces the Web Audio API to keep the node alive,
while returning `false` allows the browser to terminate the node if it is
neither generating new audio data nor receiving data through its inputs that it is
processing.

The 3 most common types of audio node are:

1.  A source of output. An {{domxref("AudioWorkletProcessor")}} implementing such a node
    should return `true` from the `process` method as long as it
    produces an output. The method should return `false` as soon as it's known
    that it will no longer produce an output. For example, take the
    {{domxref("AudioBufferSourceNode")}} — the processor behind such a node should return
    `true` from the `process` method while the buffer is playing,
    and start returning `false` when the buffer playing has ended (there's no
    way to call `play` on the same {{domxref("AudioBufferSourceNode")}} again).
2.  A node that transforms its input. A processor implementing such a node should return
    `false` from the `process` method to allow the presence of
    active input nodes and references to the node to determine whether it can be
    garbage-collected. An example of a node with this behavior is the
    {{domxref("GainNode")}}. As soon as there are no inputs connected and references
    retained, gain can no longer be applied to anything, so it can be safely
    garbage-collected.
3.  A node that transforms its input, but has a so-called _tail-time_ — this
    means that it will produce an output for some time even after its inputs are
    disconnected or are inactive (producing zero-channels). A processor implementing such
    a node should return `true` from the `process` method for the
    period of the _tail-time_, beginning as soon as inputs are found that contain
    zero-channels. An example of such a node is the {{domxref("DelayNode")}} — it has a
    _tail-time_ equal to its {{domxref("DelayNode.delayTime", "delayTime")}}
    property.

> **Note:** An absence of the `return` statement means that the method returns `undefined`, and as this is a falsy value, it is like returning `false`.
> Omitting an explicit `return` statement may cause hard-to-detect problems for your nodes.

### Exceptions

As the `process()` method is implemented by the user, it can throw anything.
If an uncaught error is thrown, the node will emit an
{{domxref("AudioWorkletNode.onprocessorerror", "onprocessorerror")}} event and will
output silence for the rest of its lifetime.

## Examples

In this example we create an `AudioWorkletProcessor` that outputs white
noise to its first output. The gain can be controlled by the `customGain`
parameter.

```js
class WhiteNoiseProcessor extends AudioWorkletProcessor {
  process (inputs, outputs, parameters) {
    // take the first output
    const output = outputs[0]
    // fill each channel with random values multiplied by gain
    output.forEach(channel => {
      for (let i = 0; i < channel.length; i++) {
        // generate random value for each sample
        // Math.random range is [0; 1); we need [-1; 1]
        // this won't include exact 1 but is fine for now for simplicity
        channel[i] = (Math.random() * 2 - 1) *
          // the array can contain 1 or 128 values
          // depending on if the automation is present
          // and if the automation rate is k-rate or a-rate
          (parameters['customGain'].length > 1
            ? parameters['customGain'][i]
            : parameters['customGain'][0])
      }
    })
    // as this is a source node which generates its own output,
    // we return true so it won't accidentally get garbage-collected
    // if we don't have any references to it in the main thread
    return true
  }
  // define the customGain parameter used in process method
  static get parameterDescriptors () {
    return [{
      name: 'customGain',
      defaultValue: 1,
      minValue: 0,
      maxValue: 1,
      automationRate: 'a-rate'
    }]
  }
}
```
