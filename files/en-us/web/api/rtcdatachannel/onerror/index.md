{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}

The **`RTCDataChannel.onerror`** property is an
[event handler](/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Event_handlers) which specifies a function to be called when the
{{DOMxRef("RTCDataChannel.error_event", "error")}} event is received. When an error occurs on the data channel, the
function receives as input an {{domxref("RTCErrorEvent")}} object describing the error
which occurred.

## Syntax

```js
RTCDataChannel.onerror = function;
```

### Value

A function which the browser will call to handle the {{DOMxRef("RTCDataChannel.error_event", "error")}} event when it
occurs on the data channel. This function receives as its only input an
{{domxref("ErrorEvent")}} object describing the event which was received. That event
object, in turn, describes the error that took place.

## Example

In the example below, a data channel is established, and an `onerror`
handler is added to it. The error handler passes information about the error to a UI
library's alert box function to present an error message to the user.

```js
let pc = new RTCPeerConnection();
let dc = pc.createDataChannel("PlayerControl");

dc.onerror = function(event) {
  myUILibrary.doAlertBox({
    'Network Error',        // Alert title
    'The error "' + event.message +
           '" occurred while handling player control network messages.',
    event.filename,
    event.lineno,
    event.colno
  });
}

/* ... */
```
