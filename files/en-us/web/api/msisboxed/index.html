<p><code><strong>msIsBoxed</strong></code> is a property which gets or sets when the video
  player control is in boxed (letterbox or pillarbox) mode.</p>

<p>This proprietary property is specific to Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge.</p>

<p>Returns true if the video is in letterbox or pillarbox mode. Letterbox format displays
  black bars on the top and bottom of a video to fill in between the wide screen format of
  a video, and the aspect ratio of the screen. Typically the video's left and right edges
  go to the full width of the screen. Pillarbox format displays black bars on the left and
  right of a video to fill in the difference between a video and a wider screen. With
  pillarbox format, the top and bottom edges of the video go to the full height of the
  screen.</p>
