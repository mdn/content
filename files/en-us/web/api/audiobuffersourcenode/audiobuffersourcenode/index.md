The **`AudioBufferSourceNode()`**
constructor creates a new {{domxref("AudioBufferSourceNode")}} object instance.

## Syntax

```js
var audioBufferSourceNode = new AudioBufferSourceNode(context, options)
```

### Parameters

- _context_
  - : A reference to an {{domxref("AudioContext")}}.
- _options_ {{optional_inline}}

  - : Options are as follows:

    - `buffer`: An instance of {{domxref("AudioBuffer")}} to be played.
    - `detune`: A value in cents to modulate the speed of audio stream
      rendering. Its nominal range is (-∞ to +∞). The default is `0`.
    - `loop`: A boolean indicating whether the audio should play in a loop.
      The default is `false`. If the loop is dynamically modified during
      playback, the new value will take effect on the next processing block of audio.
    - `loopEnd`: An optional value, in seconds, where looping should end if
      the loop attribute is `true`. The default is `0`. Its value
      is exclusive to the content of the loop. The sample frames, comprising the loop,
      run from the values `loopStart` to
      `loopEnd`-(1/`sampleRate`). It's sensible to set this to a
      value between 0 and the duration of the buffer. If `loopEnd` is less
      than 0, looping will end at 0. If `loopEnd` is greater than the
      duration of the buffer, looping will end at the end of the buffer. This attribute
      is converted to an exact sample frame offset within the buffer, by multiplying by
      the buffer's sample rate and rounding to the nearest integer value. Thus, its
      behavior is independent of the value of the `playbackRate` parameter.
    - `loopStart`: An optional value in seconds, where looping should begin
      if the loop attribute is `true`. The default is `0`. It's
      sensible to set this to a value between 0 and the duration of the buffer. If
      `loopStart` is less than 0, looping will begin at 0. If
      `loopStart` is greater than the duration of the buffer, looping will
      begin at the end of the buffer. This attribute is converted to an exact sample
      frame offset within the buffer, by multiplying by the buffer's sample rate and
      rounding to the nearest integer value. Thus, its behavior is independent of the
      value of the `playbackRate` parameter.
    - `playbackRate`: The speed at which to render the audio stream. Its
      default value is `1`. This parameter is k-rate. This is a compound
      parameter with detune. Its nominal range is (-∞ to +∞).
    - `channelCount`: Represents an integer used to determine how many channels are used when [up-mixing
      and down-mixing](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Basic_concepts_behind_Web_Audio_API#up-mixing_and_down-mixing) connections to any inputs to the node. (See
      {{domxref("AudioNode.channelCount")}} for more information.) Its usage and precise
      definition depend on the value of `channelCountMode`.
    - `channelCountMode`: Represents an enumerated value describing the way channels must be matched between
      the node's inputs and outputs. (See {{domxref("AudioNode.channelCountMode")}} for more
      information including default values.)
    - `channelInterpretation`: Represents an enumerated value describing the meaning of the channels. This
      interpretation will define how audio [up-mixing
      and down-mixing](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Basic_concepts_behind_Web_Audio_API#up-mixing_and_down-mixing) will happen.
      The possible values are `"speakers"` or `"discrete"`. (See
      {{domxref("AudioNode.channelCountMode")}} for more information including default
      values.)

### Return value

A new {{domxref("AudioBufferSourceNode")}} object instance.
