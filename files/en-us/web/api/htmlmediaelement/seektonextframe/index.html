<p>The <strong><code>HTMLMediaElement.seekToNextFrame()</code></strong> method
  asynchronously advances the current play position to the next frame in the media.</p>

<div class="warning">
  <p>This non-standard method is part of an experimentation process around support for
    non-real-time access to media for tasks including filtering, editing, and so forth.
    You should <em>not</em> use this method in production code, because its implementation
    may change—or be removed outright—without notice. You are, however, invited to
    experiment with it.</p>
</div>

<p>This method lets you access frames of video media without the media being performed in
  real time. This also lets you access media using frames as a seek unit rather than
  timecodes (albeit only by seeking one frame at a time until you get to the frame you
  want). Possible uses for this method include filtering and editing of video content.</p>

<p>This method returns immediately, returning a {{jsxref("Promise")}}, whose fulfillment
  handler is called when the seek operation is complete. In addition, a
  {{event("seeked")}} event is sent to let interested parties know that a seek has taken
  place. If the seek fails because the media is already at the last frame, a
  {{event("seeked")}} event occurs, followed immediately by an {{event("ended")}} event.
</p>

<p>If there is no video on the media element, or the media isn't seekable, nothing
  happens.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var <em>seekCompletePromise</em> = <em>HTMLMediaElement</em>.seekToNextFrame();

</pre>

<h3 id="Return_value">Return value</h3>

<p>A {{jsxref("Promise")}} which is fulfilled once the seek operation has completed.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>Firefox 49 returns {{jsxref("undefined")}} instead of a promise, and performs the
    seek operation synchronously.</p>
