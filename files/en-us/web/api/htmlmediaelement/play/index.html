<p><span class="seoSummary">The {{domxref("HTMLMediaElement")}}
    <code><strong>play()</strong></code> method attempts to begin playback of the media.
    It returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}} which is resolved when playback has been
    successfully started.</span> Failure to begin playback for any reason, such as
  permission issues, result in the promise being rejected.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js">var <em>promise</em> = <em>HTMLMediaElement</em>.play();</pre>

<h3 id="Parameters">Parameters</h3>

<p>None.</p>

<h3 id="Return_value">Return value</h3>

<p>A {{jsxref("Promise")}} which is resolved when playback has been started, or is
  rejected if for any reason playback cannot be started.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Browsers released before 2019 may not return a value from
    <code>play()</code>.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Exceptions">Exceptions</h3>

<p>The promise's <strong>rejection handler</strong> is called with an exception name
  passed in as its sole input parameter (as opposed to a traditional exception being
  thrown). Possible errors include:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>NotAllowedError</code></dt>
  <dd>The user agent (browser) or operating system doesn't allow playback of media in the
    current context or situation. This may happen, for example, if the browser requires
    the user to explicitly start media playback by clicking a "play" button.</dd>
  <dt><code>NotSupportedError</code></dt>
  <dd>The media source (which may be specified as a {{domxref("MediaStream")}},
    {{domxref("MediaSource")}}, {{domxref("Blob")}}, or {{domxref("File")}}, for example)
    doesn't represent a supported media format.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Other exceptions may be reported, depending on browser implementation details, media
  player implementation, and so forth.</p>

<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<p>Although the term "autoplay" is usually thought of as referring to pages that
  immediately begin playing media upon being loaded, web browsers' autoplay policies also
  apply to any script-initiated playback of media, including calls to <code>play()</code>.
</p>

<p>If the {{Glossary("user agent")}} is configured not to allow automatic or
  script-initiated playback of media, calling <code>play()</code> will cause the returned
  promise to be immediately rejected with a <code>NotAllowedError</code>. Web sites should
  be prepared to handle this situation. For example, a site should not present a user
  interface that assumes playback has begun automatically, but should instead update their
  UI based on whether the returned promise is fulfilled or rejected. See the
  {{anch("Example", "example")}} below for more information.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>play()</code> method may cause the user to be asked
    to grant permission to play the media, resulting in a possible delay before the
    returned promise is resolved. Be sure your code doesn't expect an immediate response.
  </p>
</div>

  article <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Autoplay_guide">Autoplay guide for media and Web
    Audio APIs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>This example demonstrates how to confirm that playback has begun and how to gracefully
  handle blocked automatic playback:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">let videoElem = document.getElementById("video");
let playButton = document.getElementById("playbutton");

playButton.addEventListener("click", handlePlayButton, false);
playVideo();

async function playVideo() {
  try {
    await videoElem.play();
    playButton.classList.add("playing");
  } catch(err) {
    playButton.classList.remove("playing");
  }
}

function handlePlayButton() {
  if (videoElem.paused) {
    playVideo();
  } else {
    videoElem.pause();
    playButton.classList.remove("playing");
  }
}</pre>

<p>In this example, playback of video is toggled off and on by the
  <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">async</a></code>
  <code>playVideo()</code> function. It tries to play the video, and if successful sets
  the class name of the <code>playButton</code> element to <code>"playing"</code>. If
  playback fails to start, the <code>playButton</code> element's class is cleared,
  restoring its default appearance. This ensures that the play button matches the actual
  state of playback by watching for the resolution or rejection of the
  {{jsxref("Promise")}} returned by <code>play()</code>.</p>

<p>When this example is executed, it begins by collecting references to the
  {{HTMLElement("video")}} element as well as the {{HTMLElement("button")}} used to toggle
  playback on and off. It then sets up an event handler for the {{event("click")}} event
  on the play toggle button and attempts to automatically begin playback by calling
  <code>playVideo()</code>.</p>
