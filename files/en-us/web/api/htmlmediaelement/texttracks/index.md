{{APIRef("HTML DOM")}}

The read-only **`textTracks`**
property on {{DOMxRef("HTMLMediaElement")}} objects returns a
{{DOMxRef("TextTrackList")}} object listing all of the {{DOMxRef("TextTrack")}}
objects representing the media element's text tracks, in the same order as in
the list of text tracks.

You can detect when tracks are added to and removed from an
[`<audio>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) or
[`<video>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) element
using the `addtrack` and `removetrack` events. However, these
events aren't sent directly to the media element itself. Instead, they're sent to the
track list object of the [`HTMLMediaElement`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement "The HTMLMediaElement interface adds to HTMLElement the properties and methods needed to support basic media-related capabilities that are common to audio and video.")
that corresponds to the type of track that was added to the element

The returned list is _live_; that is, as tracks are added to and removed from
the media element, the list's contents change dynamically. Once you have a reference to
the list, you can monitor it for changes to detect when new text tracks are added or
existing ones removed.

See {{SectionOnPage("/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextTrackList", "Event handlers")}} to learn
more about watching for changes to a media element's track list.

## Syntax

```js
var textTracks = mediaElement.textTracks;
```

### Value

A {{DOMxRef("TextTrackList")}} object representing the list of text tracks included in
the media element. The list of tracks can be accessed using array notation, or using the
object's
[`getTrackById()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/VideoTrackList/getTrackById)
method.

Each track is represented by a {{DOMxRef("TextTrack")}} object which provides
information about the track.

## Examples

We start with a
[`<video>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) that has
several [`<track>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/track)
children

```html
<video controls poster="/images/sample.gif">
  <source src="sample.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="sample.ogv" type="video/ogv">
  <track kind="captions" src="sampleCaptions.vtt" srclang="en">
  <track kind="descriptions" src="sampleDescriptions.vtt" srclang="en">
  <track kind="chapters" src="sampleChapters.vtt" srclang="en">
  <track kind="subtitles" src="sampleSubtitles_de.vtt" srclang="de">
  <track kind="subtitles" src="sampleSubtitles_en.vtt" srclang="en">
  <track kind="subtitles" src="sampleSubtitles_ja.vtt" srclang="ja">
  <track kind="subtitles" src="sampleSubtitles_oz.vtt" srclang="oz">
  <track kind="metadata" src="keyStage1.vtt" srclang="en" label="Key Stage 1">
  <track kind="metadata" src="keyStage2.vtt" srclang="en" label="Key Stage 2">
  <track kind="metadata" src="keyStage3.vtt" srclang="en" label="Key Stage 3">
</video>
```

The `HTMLMediaElement.textTracks` returns a
`textTracksList` thru which we can iterate.Â  Here we print all the properties
of each English track to the console.

```js
var tracks = document.querySelector('video').textTracks;

for (var i = 0, L = tracks.length; i < L; i++) { /* tracks.length == 10 */
   if (tracks[i].language == 'en') {
      console.dir(tracks[i]);
   }
}
```
