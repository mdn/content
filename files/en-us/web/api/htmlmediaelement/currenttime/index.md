{{APIRef("HTML DOM")}}

The {{domxref("HTMLMediaElement")}} interface's
**`currentTime`** property specifies the current playback time
in seconds.

Changing the value of `currentTime` seeks the media to
the new time.

## Syntax

```js
var currentTime = htmlMediaElement.currentTime;
htmlMediaElement.currentTime = 35;
```

### Value

A double-precision floating-point value indicating the current playback time in
seconds.

If the media is not yet playing, the value of `currentTime` indicates the
time position within the media at which playback will begin once the
{{domxref("HTMLMediaElement.play", "play()")}} method is called.

Setting `currentTime` to a new value seeks the media to the given time, if
the media is available.

For media without a known duration—such as media being streamed live—it's possible that
the browser may not be able to obtain parts of the media that have expired from the
media buffer. Also, media whose timeline doesn't begin at 0 seconds cannot be seeked to
a time before its timeline's earliest time.

The length of the media in seconds can be determined using the
{{domxref("HTMLMediaElement.duration", "duration")}} property.

## Example

```js
var video = document.createElement('video');
console.log(video.currentTime);
```

## Usage notes

### Reduced time precision

To offer protection against timing attacks and fingerprinting, browsers may round or
otherwise adjust the value returned by `currentTime`.
