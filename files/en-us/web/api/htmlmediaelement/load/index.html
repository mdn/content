<div>{{APIRef("HTML DOM")}}</div>

<p><span class="seoSummary">The {{domxref("HTMLMediaElement")}} method
    <code><strong>load()</strong></code> resets the media element to its initial state and
    begins the process of selecting a media source and loading the media in preparation
    for playback to begin at the beginning.</span> The amount of media data that is
  prefetched is determined by the value of the element's {{htmlattrxref("preload",
  "video")}} attribute.</p>

<p>This method is generally only useful when you've made dynamic changes to the set of
  sources available for the media element, either by changing the element's
  {{htmlattrxref("src", "video")}} attribute or by adding or removing
  {{HTMLElement("source")}} elements nested within the media element itself.
  <code>load()</code> will reset the element and rescan the available sources, thereby
  causing the changes to take effect.</p>

<p><code>undefined</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<p>Calling <code>load()</code> aborts all ongoing operations involving this media element,
  then begins the process of selecting and loading an appropriate media resource given the
  options specified in the {{HTMLElement("audio")}} or {{HTMLElement("video")}} element
  and its {{htmlattrxref("src", "video")}} attribute or child {{HTMLElement("source")}}
  element(s). This is described in more detail in
  {{SectionOnPage("/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Video_and_audio_content",
  "Supporting multiple formats")}}.</p>

<p>The process of aborting any ongoing activities will cause any outstanding
  {{jsxref("Promise")}}s returned by {{domxref("HTMLMediaElement.play", "play()")}} being
 fulfilled or rejected as appropriate based on their status before the loading of new
  media can begin. Pending play promises are aborted with an <code>"AbortError"</code>
  {{domxref("DOMException")}}.</p>

<p>Appropriate events will be sent to the media element itself as the load process
  proceeds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the element is already in the process of loading media, that load process is
    aborted and the <strong>{{event("abort")}}</strong> event is sent.</li>
  <li>If the element has already been initialized with media, the
    <strong>{{event("emptied")}}</strong> event is sent.</li>
  <li>If resetting the playback position to the beginning of the media actually changes
    the playback position (that is, it was not already at the beginning), a
    <strong>{{event("timeupdate")}}</strong> event is sent.</li>
  <li>Once media has been selected and loading is ready to begin, the
    <strong>{{event("loadstart")}}</strong> event is delivered.</li>
  <li>From this point onward, events are sent just like any media load.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>This example finds a {{HTMLElement("video")}} element in the document and resets it by
  calling <code>load()</code>.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var mediaElem = document.querySelector("video");
mediaElem.load();
