<div>{{APIRef("HTML DOM")}}</div>

<p><span class="seoSummary">The <strong>{{domxref("AudioTrack")}}</strong> property
    <code><strong>enabled</strong></code> specifies whether or not the described audio
    track is currently enabled for use. If the track is disabled by setting
    <code>enabled</code> to <code>false</code>, the track is muted and does not produce
    audio.</span></p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush: js"><em>isAudioEnabled</em> = <em>AudioTrack</em>.enabled;

<em>AudioTrack</em>.enabled = <em>true</em> | <em>false</em>;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>The <code>enabled</code> property is a Boolean whose value is <code>true</code> if the
  track is enabled; enabled tracks produce audio while the media is playing. Setting
  <code>enabled</code> to <code>false</code> effectively mutes the audio track, preventing
  it from contributing to the media's audio performance.</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>This example switches between the main and commentary audio tracks of a media element.
</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function swapCommentaryMain() {
  var videoElem = document.getElementById("main-video");
  var audioTrackMain;
  var audioTrackCommentary;

  videoElem.audioTracks.forEach(track) {
    if (track.kind === "main") {
      audioTrackMain = track;
    } else if (track.kind === "commentary") {
      audioTrackCommentary = track;
    }
  }

  if (audioTrackMain &amp;&amp; audioTrackCommentary) {
    var commentaryEnabled = audioTrackCommentary.enabled;
    audioTrackCommentary.enabled = audioTrackMain.enabled;
    audioTrackMain.enabled = commentaryEnabled;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>The <code>swapCommentaryMain()</code> function above finds within the audio tracks of
  the {{HTMLElement("video")}} element <code>"main-video"</code> the audio tracks whose
  {{domxref("AudioTrack.kind", "kind")}} values are <code>"main"</code> and
  <code>"commentary"</code>. These represent the primary audio track and the commentary
  track.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This example assumes that there is only one of each kind of
    track in the video, but this is not necessarily the case.</p>
</div>

<p>The element's audio tracks are then scanned through using the JavaScript
  {{jsxref("Array.forEach", "forEach()")}} method (although the
  {{domxref("HTMLMediaElement.audioTracks", "audioTracks")}} property of a media element
  isn't actually a JavaScript array, it can be accessed like one for the most part).</p>

<p>The scan looks for the tracks whose {{domxref("AudioTrack.kind", "kind")}} values are
  <code>"main"</code> and <code>"commentary"</code> and remembers those
  {{domxref("AudioTrack")}} objects. Once those have been found, the values of the two
  tracks' <code>enabled</code> properties are exchanged, which results in swapping which
  of the two tracks is currently active.</p>
