<div>{{APIRef("WebXR Device API")}}</div>

<p><span class="seoSummary">The
    <em>read-only</em> <strong><code>visibilityState</code></strong> property of the
    {{DOMxRef("XRSession")}} interface is a string indicating whether the WebXR content is
    currently visible to the user, and if it is, whether it's the primary focus.</span>
</p>

<p>Every time the visibility state changes, a
  {{DOMxRef("XRSession.visibilitychange_event","visibilitychange")}} event is fired on the
  {{DOMxRef("XRSession")}} object.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js"><em>visibilityState</em> = <em>xrSession</em>.visibilityState;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A string indicating whether or not the XR content is
  visible to the user and if it is, whether or not it's currently the primary focus.</p>

<p>The possible values of <code>visibilityState</code> are:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>hidden</code></dt>
  <dd>The virtual scene generated by the {{domxref("XRSession")}} is not currently visible to the user,
    so its {{domxref("XRSession.requestAnimationFrame", "requestAnimationFrame()")}}
    callbacks are <em>not</em> being executed until the <code>visibilityState</code> changes.
    Input controllers are <em>not</em> being handled for the session.</dd>
  <dt><code>visible</code></dt>
  <dd>The virtual scene rendered by the {{domxref("XRSession")}} is currently visible to the user
    and is the primary focus of the user's attention. To that end, the session's
    {{domxref("XRSession.requestAnimationFrame", "requestAnimationFrame()")}} callbacks are being processed
    at the XR device's native refresh rate and input controllers are being processed as normal.</dd>
  <dt><code>visible-blurred</code></dt>
  <dd>While the virtual scene rendered by the {{domxref("XRSession")}} may currently be visible to the user,
    it is not the user's primary focus at the moment; it's also possible the session is not currently visible at all.
    In order to optimize resource utilization, the {{Glossary("user agent")}} may be handling the session's 
    {{domxref("XRSession.requestAnimationFrame", "requestAnimationFrame()")}} callbacks at a throttled rate.
    Input controllers are <em>not</em> being processed for the session.</dd>
 </dl>

<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<p>It's important to keep in mind that because an immersive WebXR session is potentially
  being shown using a different display than the HTML document in which it's running (such
  as when being shown on a headset), the value of a
  session's <code>visibilityState</code> may not necessarily be the same as the owning
  <em>{{domxref("document")}}'s</em> {{domxref("Document.visibilityState",
  "visibilityState")}}. For instance, if the viewer is using a headset tethered to a
  computer and the immersive scene is obscured by a configuration UI, the user could peek
  out from behind the headset and still be able to see the document itself on their
  computer's monitor.</p>
