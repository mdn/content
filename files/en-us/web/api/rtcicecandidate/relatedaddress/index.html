<p><span class="seoSummary">The <strong>{{domxref("RTCIceCandidate")}}</strong>
    interface's read-only <strong><code>relatedAddress</code></strong> property is a
    string indicating the <strong>related address</strong> of a relay or reflexive
    candidate.</span> If the candidate is a host candidate (that is, its
  {{domxref("RTCIceCandidate/address", "ip")}} is in fact the real IP address of the remote
  peer), <code>relatedAddress</code> is <code>null</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>relatedAddress</code> field's value is set when the
  {{domxref("RTCIceCandidate.RTCIceCandidate", "RTCIceCandidate()")}} constructor is used.
  You can't specify the value of <code>relatedAddress</code> in the options object, but
  the address is automatically extracted from the
  {{domxref("RTCIceCandidateInit.candidate", "candidate")}} a-line, if it's formatted
  properly, being taken from its <code>rel-address</code> field.</p>

<p>The related address and port ({{domxref("RTCIceCandidate.relatedPort",
  "relatedPort")}}) are not used at all by {{Glossary("ICE")}} itself; they are provided
  for analysis and diagnostic purposes only, and their inclusion may be blocked by
  security systems, so do not rely on them having non-<code>null</code> values.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js">var <em>relAddress</em> = <em>RTCIceCandidate</em>.relatedAddress;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A {{domxref("DOMString")}} which contains the candidate's related address. For both
  peer and server reflexive candidates, the related address (and related port) are the
  base for that server or peer reflexive candidate. For relay candidates, the related
  address and port are set to the mapped address selected by the TURN server.</p>

<p>For host candidates, <code>relatedAddress</code> is <code>null</code>, meaning the
  field is not included in the candidate's a-line.</p>

<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<p>The related address is included in ICE candidates despite not being used by ICE itself.
  <code>relatedAddress</code> can be used for diagnostic purposes; by observing the
  relationships between the various types of candidates and their addresses and related
  addresses. <code>relatedAddress</code> can also be used by Quality-of-Service (QoS)
  mechanisms.</p>

<p>Here's an {{Glossary("SDP")}} attribute line (a-line) describing an ICE candidate
  discovered by the STUN server:</p>

<pre>a=candidate:4234997325 1 udp 2043278322 192.168.0.56 6502 typ srflx raddr 192.168.2.77 rport 32768 generation 0</pre>

<p>The remote address, <code>relatedAddress</code>, is the dotted quad (for IPv4) or
  colon-delineated 64-bit address (for IPv6) immediately following the text
  <code>"raddr"</code>, or <code>"192.168.2.77"</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>In this example, the candidate's {{domxref("RTCIceCandidate.type", "type")}} is
  checked, and then debugging output is presented, based on the candidate type, including
  the candidate's {{domxref("RTCIceCandidate/address", "ip")}} and <code>relatedAddress</code>.
</p>

<pre class="brush: js">switch(candidate.type) {
  case "host":
    console.log("Host candidate's IP address is " + candidate.ip);
    break;
  case "srflx":
    console.log("Server reflexive candidate's base address is " +
        candidate.relatedAddress + "; reachable at " + candidate.ip);
    break;
  case "prflx":
    console.log("Peer reflexive candidate's base address is " +
        candidate.relatedAddress + "; reachable at " + candidate.ip);
    break;
  case "relay":
    console.log("Relay candidate's address assigned by the TURN server is " +
        candidate.relatedAddress + "; reachable at " + candidate.ip);
    break;
}</pre>
