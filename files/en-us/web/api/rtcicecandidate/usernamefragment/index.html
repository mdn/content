<div>{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}</div>

<p><span class="seoSummary">The read-only <strong><code>usernameFragment</code></strong>
    property on the {{domxref("RTCIceCandidate")}} interface is a string indicating the
    username fragment ("ufrag") that uniquely identifies a single ICE interaction
    session.</span></p>

<p>This value is specified when creating the {{domxref("RTCIceCandidate")}} by setting the
  corresponding {{domxref("RTCIceCandidateInit.usernameFragment", "usernameFragment")}}
  value in the {{domxref("RTCIceCandidateInit")}} object when creating a new candidate
  with {{domxref("RTCIceCandidate.RTCIceCandidate", "new RTCIceCandidate()")}}. Note that
  24 bits of the username fragment are required to be randomized by the browser. See
  {{anch("Randomization")}} below for details.</p>

<p>If you instead call <code>RTCIceCandidate()</code> with a string parameter containing
  the <code>candidate</code> m-line text, the value of <code>usernameFragment</code> is
  extracted from the m-line.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js">var <em>ufrag</em> = <em>RTCIceCandidate</em>.usernameFragment;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>A {{domxref("DOMString")}} containing the username fragment (usually referred to in
  shorthand as "ufrag" or "ice-ufrag") that, along with the ICE password ("ice-pwd"),
  uniquely identifies a single ongoing ICE interaction, including for any communication
  with the {{Glossary("STUN")}} server. The string may be up to 256 characters long, and
  has no default value.</p>

<h4 id="Randomization">Randomization</h4>

<p>At least 24 bits of the text in the <code>ufrag</code> are required to be randomly
  selected by the ICE layer at the beginning of the ICE session. The specifics for which
  bits are random and what the remainder of the <code>ufrag</code> text are left up to the
  browser implementation to decide. For example, a browser might choose to always use a
  24-character <code>ufrag</code> in which bit 4 of each character is randomly selected
  between 0 and 1. Another example: it might take a user-defined string and append three
  8-bit random bytes to the end. Or perhaps every character is entirely random.</p>

<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<p>ICE uses the <code>usernameFragment</code> and password to ensure message integrity.
  This avoids crosstalk among multiple ongoing ICE sessions, but, more importantly, helps
  secure ICE transactions (and all of WebRTC by extension) against attacks that might try
  to inject themselves into an ICE exchange.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> There is no API to obtain the ICE password, for what should be
    fairly obvious security reasons.</p>
</div>

<p>The <code>usernameFragment</code> and password both change every time an <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API/Session_lifetime#ice_restart">ICE restart</a>
  occurs.</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>Although the WebRTC infrastructure will filter out obsolete candidates for you after an
  ICE restart, you can do it yourself if you're trying to absolutely minimize the number
  of messages going back and forth.</p>

<p>To do so, you can compare the value of <code>usernameFragment</code> to the current
  <code>usernameFragment</code> being used for the connection after receiving the
  candidate from the signaling server and before caling
  {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.addIceCandidate", "addIceCandidate()")}} to add it to the
  set of possible candidates.</p>

<p>When the web app receives a message from the signaling server that includes a candidate
  to be added to the {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}}, you can (and generally
  <em>should</em>) call <code>addIceCandidate()</code>. There's not typically a need to
  manually worry about filtering the candidates.</p>

<p>However, let's imagine that we do need to minimize traffic. The function below,
  <code>ssNewCandidate()</code>, is called when a message, <code>signalMsg</code>, arrives
  from the signaling server that contains an ICE candidate to be added to the
  <code>RTCPeerConnection</code>. To avoid including candidates obsoleted by an ICE
  restart, we can use code like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">const ssNewCandidate = signalMsg =&gt; {
  let candidate = new RTCIceCandidate(signalMsg.candidate);
  let receivers = pc.getReceivers();

  receivers.forEach(receiver =&gt; {
    let parameters = receiver.transport.getParameters();

    if (parameters.usernameFragment === candidate.usernameFragment) {
      return;
    }
  });

  pc.addIceCandidate(candidate)
    .catch(reportError);
}
</pre>

<p>This walks through the list of the {{domxref("RTCRtpReceiver")}} objects being used to
  receive ICE data, and looks to see if the <code>usernameFragment</code> indicated in the
  candidate matches any of them. If it does, <code>ssNewCandidate()</code> aborts.
  Otherwise, after checking every receiver, it adds the new candidate to the connection.
