{{ApiRef("DOM")}}

The **`EventTarget`** interface is implemented by objects that can receive events and may have listeners for them.
 In other words, any target of events implements the three methods associated with this interface.

{{domxref("Element")}}, and its children, as well as {{domxref("Document")}} and {{domxref("Window")}}, are the most common event targets,
but other objects can be event targets, too.
For example {{domxref("XMLHttpRequest")}}, {{domxref("AudioNode")}}, and {{domxref("AudioContext")}} are also event targets.

Many event targets (including elements, documents, and windows) also support setting [event handlers](/en-US/docs/Web/Events/Event_handlers) via `onevent` properties and attributes.
