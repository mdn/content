{{APIRef("Media Capture and Streams")}}

The **`getCapabilities()`** method of
the {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} interface returns a
{{domxref('MediaTrackCapabilities')}} object which specifies the values or range of
values which each constrainable property, based upon the platform and {{Glossary("user
    agent")}}.

Once you know what the browser's capabilities are, your script can use
{{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints", "applyConstraints()")}} to ask for the
track to be configured to match ideal or acceptable settings. See [Capabilities, constraints,
and settings](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Streams_API/Constraints) for details on how to work with constrainable properties.

## Syntax

```js
const capabilities = track.getCapabilities()
```

### Return value

A {{domxref('MediaTrackCapabilities')}} object which specifies the value or range of
values which are supported for each of the user agent's supported constrainable
properties.
