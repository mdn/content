<p><span class="seoSummary">The <strong><code>getConstraints()</code></strong> method of
    the {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} interface returns a
    {{domxref('MediaTrackConstraints')}} object containing the set of constraints most
    recently established for the track using a prior call to
    {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints", "applyConstraints()")}}. These
    constraints indicate values and ranges of values that the Web site or application has
    specified are required or acceptable for the included constrainable properties.</span>
</p>

<p>Constraints can be used to ensure that the media meets certain guidelines you prefer.
  For example, you may prefer high definition video but require that the frame rate be a
  little low to help keep the data rate low enough not overtax the network. Constraints
  can also specify ideal and/or acceptable sizes or ranges of sizes. See <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Streams_API/Constraints">Capabilities, constraints,
    and settings</a> for details on how to work with constrainable properties.</p>

<pre
  class="brush: js">const <em>constraints</em> = <em>track</em>.getConstraints()</pre>

<h3 id="Return_value">
    Return value
</h3>

<p>A {{domxref('MediaTrackConstraints')}} object which indicates the constrainable
  properties the Web site or app most recently set using
  {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.applyConstraints", "applyConstraints()")}}. The properties
  in the returned object are listed in the same order as when they were set, and only
  properties specifically set by the site or app are included.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> The returned set of constraints doesn't necessarily describe
    the actual state of the media. Even if any of the constraints couldn't be met, they
    are still included in the returned object as originally set by the site's code. To get
    the currently active settings for all constrainable properties, you should instead
    call {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.getSettings", "getSettings()")}}.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>This example obtains the current constraints for a track, sets the
  {{domxref("MediaTrackConstraints.facingMode", "facingMode")}}, and applies the updated
  constraints.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function switchCameras(track, camera) {
  const constraints = track.getConstraints();
  constraints.facingMode = camera;
  track.applyConstraints(constraints);
}</pre>
