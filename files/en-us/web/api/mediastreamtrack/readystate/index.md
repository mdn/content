The **`MediaStreamTrack.readyState`** read-only property returns an enumerated value giving the status of the track.

## Value

It takes one of the following values:

- `"live"` which indicates that an input is connected and does its
  best-effort in providing real-time data. In that case, the output of data can be
  switched on or off using the {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.enabled")}} property.
- `"ended"` which indicates that the input is not giving any more data and
  will never provide new data.
