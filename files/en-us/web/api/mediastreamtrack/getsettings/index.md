{{APIRef("Media Capture and Streams")}}

The **`getSettings()`** method of the
{{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} interface returns a {{domxref("MediaTrackSettings")}}
object containing the current values of each of the constrainable properties for the
current `MediaStreamTrack`.

See [Capabilities, constraints,
and settings](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Streams_API/Constraints) for details on how to work with constrainable properties.

## Syntax

```js
const settings = track.getSettings()
```

### Returns

A {{domxref("MediaTrackSettings")}} object describing the current configuration of the
track's constrainable properties.

> **Note:** The returned object identifies the current values of every
> constrainable property, including those which are platform defaults rather than having
> been expressly set by the site's code. To instead fetch the most-recently established
> constraints for the track's properties, as specified by the site's code, use
> {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.getConstraints", "getConstraints()")}}.
