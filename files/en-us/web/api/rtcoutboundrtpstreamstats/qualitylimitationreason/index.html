<p><span class="seoSummary">The <strong><code>qualityLimitationReason</code></strong>
    property of the {{domxref("RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats")}} dictionary is a string
    indicating the reason why the media quality in the stream is currently being reduced
    by the codec during encoding, or <code>none</code> if no quality reduction is being
    performed.</span> This quality reduction may include changes such as reduced frame
  rate or resolution, or an increase in compression factor.</p>

<p>The amount of time the encoded media has had its quality reduced in each of the
  potential ways that can be done can be found in
  {{domxref("RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats.qualityLimitationDurations",
  "qualityLimitationDurations")}}.</p>
