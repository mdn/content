<p><span class="seoSummary">The <strong><code>pliCount</code></strong> property of the
    {{domxref("RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats")}} dictionary states the number of times the
    remote peer's {{domxref("RTCRtpReceiver")}} sent a <strong>Picture Loss
      Indication</strong> (<strong>PLI</strong>) packet to the {{domxref("RTCRtpSender")}}
    for which this object provides statistics.</span> A PLI packet indicates that some
  amount of encoded video data has been lost for one or more frames.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>An integer value indicating the number of times a PLI packet was sent to this sender by
  the remote peer's {{domxref("RTCRtpReceiver")}}. These are sent by the receiver's
  decoder to notify the sender's encoder that an undefined amount of coded video data,
  which may span frame boundaries, has been lost.</p>

<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<p>Upon receiving a PLI packet, the sender may have responded by sending a full frame to
  the remote peer to allow it to re-synchronize with the media. However, the primary
  purpose of a PLI packet is to allow the <code>RTCRtpSender</code> for which this
  <code>RTCOutboundRtpStreamStats</code> object provides statistics to consider techniques
  to mitigate network performance issues. This is often achieved by methods such as
  increasing the compression or lowering resolution, although the mechanisms available to
  reduce the bit rate of the stream vary from codec to codec.</p>
