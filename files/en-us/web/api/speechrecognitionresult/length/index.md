{{APIRef("Web Speech API")}}{{ SeeCompatTable() }}

The **`length`** read-only property of the
{{domxref("SpeechRecognitionResult")}} interface returns the length of the "array"
â€” the number of {{domxref("SpeechRecognitionAlternative")}} objects contained
in the result (also referred to as "n-best alternatives".)

The number of alternatives contained in the result depends on what the
{{domxref("SpeechRecognition.maxAlternatives")}} property was set to when the speech
recognition was first initiated.

## Syntax

```js
var myLength = speechRecognitionResultInstance.length;
```

### Returns

A number.

## Examples

This code is excerpted from our [Speech
color changer](https://github.com/mdn/web-speech-api/blob/master/speech-color-changer/script.js) example.

```js
recognition.onresult = function(event) {
  // The SpeechRecognitionEvent results property returns a SpeechRecognitionResultList object
  // The SpeechRecognitionResultList object contains SpeechRecognitionResult objects.
  // It has a getter so it can be accessed like an array
  // The first [0] returns the SpeechRecognitionResult at position 0.
  // Each SpeechRecognitionResult object contains SpeechRecognitionAlternative objects
  // that contain individual results.
  // These also have getters so they can be accessed like arrays.
  // The second [0] returns the SpeechRecognitionAlternative at position 0.
  // We then return the transcript property of the SpeechRecognitionAlternative object
  var color = event.results[0][0].transcript;
  diagnostic.textContent = 'Result received: ' + color + '.';
  bg.style.backgroundColor = color;

  console.log(event.results[0].length);
}
```
