The **`options`** read-only property
of the {{domxref("PushSubscription")}} interface is an object containing the options
used to create the subscription.

## Value

An read-only {{domxref("PushSubscriptionOptions")}} object containing the following values:

- `userVisibleOnly`
  - : A boolean, indicating that the returned push
    subscription will only be used for messages whose effect is made visible to the user.
- `applicationServerKey`

    messages to client apps via a push server. This value is part of a signing key pair
    generated by your application server, and usable with elliptic curve digital signature
