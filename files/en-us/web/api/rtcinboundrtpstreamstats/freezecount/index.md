{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}

The **`freezeCount`** property of the {{domxref("RTCInboundRtpStreamStats")}} dictionary indicates the total number of video freezes experienced by this receiver.

A freeze is counted if the interval between two rendered frames is equal to or greater than the larger of "three times the average duration", or "the average + 150ms".
This ensures that the delay required to increment the freeze count scales appropriately with the frame rate.

> [!NOTE]
> The value is undefined for audio streams.
