<p><span class="seoSummary">The <strong><code>packetsDuplicated</code></strong> property
    of the {{domxref("RTCInboundRtpStreamStats")}} dictionary indicates the total number
    of packets discarded because they were duplicates of previously-received
    packets.</span> These packets are not counted by the
  {{domxref("RTCInboundRtpSreamStats.packetsDiscarded", "packetsDiscarded")}} property.
</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js">var <em>packetsDuplicated</em> = <em>rtcInboundRtpStreamStats</em>.packetsDuplicated;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>An integer value which specifies how many duplcate packets have been received by the
  local end of this RTP stream so far. These duplicate packets are not included in the
  {{domxref("RTCInboundRtpSreamStats.packetsDiscarded", "packetsDiscarded")}} property.
</p>

<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<p>Duplicate packets are detected when a packet has the same RTP sequence number as
  another packet that has previously been processed. Each time a packet is repeated, the
  value of <code>packetsDuplicated</code> is incremented, even if the same packet is
  received more than twice.</p>

<p>You can get a more accurate tally of how many packets have been lost on the stream by
  adding <code>packetsDuplicated</code> to
  {{domxref("RTCInboundRtpSreamStats.packetsLost", "packetsLost")}}. The resulting value
  will be positive, although it will not match the count as computed in {{RFC(3660)}}.</p>
