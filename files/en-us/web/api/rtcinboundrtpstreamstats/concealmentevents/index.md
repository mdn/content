{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}

The **`concealmentEvents`** property of the {{domxref("RTCInboundRtpStreamStats")}} dictionary indicates the total number of concealment events for the received audio track over the lifetime of this stats object.

A concealed sample is a sample that was lost or arrived too late to be played out, and therefore had to be replaced with a locally generated synthesized sample.
Any number of consecutive concealed samples following a non-concealed sample comprise a single concealment event.
The value in this property will therefore be less than or equal to {{domxref("RTCInboundRtpStreamStats.concealedSamples", "concealedSamples")}}, which counts every sample.

> [!NOTE]
> The value is undefined for video streams.
