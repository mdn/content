<p><span class="seoSummary">The <strong><code>fecPacketsReceived</code></strong> property
        of the {{domxref("RTCInboundRtpStreamStats")}} dictionary indicates how many
        Forward Error Correction (FEC) packets have been received by this RTP receiver
        from the remote peer.</span> An FEC packet provides parity information which can
    be used to attempt to reconstruct RTP data packets which have been corrupted in
    transit.</p>

<pre
    class="brush: js">var <em>fecPacketsReceived</em> = <em>rtcInboundRtpStreamStats</em>.fecPacketsReceived;</pre>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>An unsigned integer value which indicates the total number of FEC packets which have
    been received from the remote peer during this RTP session. Forward Error Correction
    uses an exclusive-or method to perform parity checks on the received data.</p>

<p>By using the FEC parity information to attempt to reconstruct damaged packets, it is
    possible to avoid the need to retransmit damaged packets, which in turn helps to
    reduce lag, or the need to skip damaged frames entirely.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> This counter may also be incremented when FEC packets arrive
        in-band along with media content; this can happen with Opus, for example.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<p>It's possible that a subset of the FEC packets which have been received were discarded
    instead of being used. This can happen if the packets covered by the FEC packets have
    already been received successfully or have already been reconstructed using a
    previously-received FEC packet. This may also happen if the FEC packet arrives outside
    the window of time in which the client will attempt to use it.</p>

<p>If you wish to know how many of the received packets were discarded, you can examine
    the value of {{domxref("RTCInboundRtpStreamStats.fecPacketsDiscarded",
    "fecPacketsDiscarded")}}.</p>
