{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}

The **`audioLevel`** property of the {{domxref("RTCInboundRtpStreamStats")}} dictionary indicates the audio level of the received (remote) track.

The `audioLevel` is averaged over some small interval, using the algorithm described under {{domxref("RTCInboundRtpStreamStats.totalAudioEnergy","totalAudioEnergy")}}.
The interval used is implementation dependent.

> [!NOTE]
> The value is undefined for video streams.

## Value

A real number.

The value is between 0..1 (linear), where 1.0 represents 0 dBov ([decibels relative to full scale (DBFS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBFS)), 0 represents silence, and 0.5 represents approximately 6 dB SPL change in the [sound pressure level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_pressure#Sound_pressure_level) from 0 dBov.
