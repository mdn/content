{{APIRef("WebRTC")}}

The **`totalFreezesDuration`** property of the {{domxref("RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats")}} dictionary indicates the total time that the video in this stream has spent frozen, in seconds.

A freeze is counted if the interval between two rendered frames is equal or greater than the larger of "three times the average duration", or "the average + 150ms", and the time taken between frames is added to the `totalFreezesDuration`.

The average freeze duration can be calculated using `totalFreezesDuration / freezeCount`.

> [!NOTE]
> The property is undefined for audio streams.
