The **`totalPausesDuration`** property of the {{domxref("RTCRemoteInboundRtpStreamStats")}} dictionary indicates the total time that the video in this stream has spent paused, in seconds

A pause is counted when a new frame is rendered more than 5 seconds after the last frame was rendered, and the time taken between frames is added to the `totalPausesDuration`.

The average pause duration can be calculated using `totalPausesDuration / pauseCount`.

> [!NOTE]
> The property is undefined for audio streams.
