<p class="summary">The <strong><code>CookieStoreManager</code></strong> interface of the {{domxref('Cookie Store')}} API allows service workers to subscribe to events for cookie changes. By using the {{domxref("CookieStoreManager.subscribe()","subscribe()")}} method a particular service worker registration can indicate that it is interested in change events.</p>

<p>A <code>CookieStoreManager</code> has an associated {{domxref("ServiceWorkerRegistration")}}. Each service worker registration has a cookie change subscription list, which is a list of cookie change subscriptions each containing a name and url. The methods in this interface allow the service worker to add and remove subscriptions from this list, and to get a list of all subscriptions.</p>

<p>To get a <code>CookieStoreManager</code>, call {{domxref("ServiceWorkerRegistration.cookies")}}.</p>

<h2 id="Methods">Methods</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>{{domxref("CookieStoreManager.getSubscriptions()")}}</dt>
  <dd>Returns a {{jsxref("promise")}} which resolves to a list of the cookie change subscriptions for this service worker registration.</dd>
  <dt>{{domxref("CookieStoreManager.subscribe()")}}</dt>
  <dd>Subscribes to changes to cookies. It returns a {{jsxref("promise")}} which resolves when the subscription is successful.</dd>
  <dt>{{domxref("CookieStoreManager.unsubscribe()")}}</dt>
  <dd>Unsubscribes the registered service worker from changes to cookies. It returns a {{jsxref("promise")}} which resolves when the operation is successful.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>In this example the {{domxref("ServiceWorkerRegistration")}} represented by <code>registration</code> is subscribing to change events on the cookie named <code>"cookie1"</code> with a scope of <code>"/path1"</code>.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">const subscriptions = [{ name: 'cookie1', url: `/path1` }];
await registration.cookies.subscribe(subscriptions);</pre>

<p>If the {{domxref("ServiceWorkerRegistration")}} has subscribed to any cookies then {{domxref("CookieStoreManager.getSubscriptions()","getSubscriptions()")}} will return a list of cookies represented by objects in the same format as used for the original subscription.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">const subscriptions = await registration.cookies.getSubscriptions();</pre>
