<p><span class="seoSummary">An object based on {{domxref("AddressErrors")}} includesÂ an <code><strong>organization</strong></code> property when the address's {{domxref("PaymentAddress.organization", "organization")}} property couldn't be validated. The returned string explains the error and should offer suggestions for how to correct it.</span></p>

<h3 id="Value">Value</h3>

<p>If the value specified in the {{domxref("PaymentAddress")}} object's {{domxref("PaymentAddress.organization", "organization")}} property could not be validated, this property contains a {{domxref("DOMString")}} offering a human-readable explanation of the validation error and offers suggestions for correcting it.</p>

<p>For example, if validation ensures that only permitted characters are included in the organization's name, this might return a string such as "The organization name may only contain the letters A-Z, digits, spaces, and commas."</p>

<p>If the <code>organization</code> value was validated successfully, this property is not included in the <code>AddressErrors</code> object.</p>
