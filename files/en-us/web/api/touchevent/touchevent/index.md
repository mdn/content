{{APIRef("Touch Events")}}

The **`TouchEvent()`** constructor creates a new {{domxref("TouchEvent")}} object.

> **Note:** If you construct a synthetic event using this constructor, that event will not be _trusted_, for security reasons.
> Only browser-generated `TouchEvent` objects are trusted and only trusted events trigger default actions.

## Syntax

```js
new TouchEvent(type)
new TouchEvent(type, options)
```

### Parameters

- `type`
  - : A string with the name of the event.
    It is case-sensitive and browsers set it to `touchstart`, `touchend`, `touchmove`, `touchcancel`

    - `targetTouches` {{optional_inline}}
      - : A {{domxref("TouchList")}}, defaulting to an empty one,, that is a list of objects for every point of contact that is touching the surface

    - `changedTouches` {{optional_inline}}
      - : and defaulting to `[]`, of type `Touch[]`, that is a list of objects for every point of contact which contributed to the event.
