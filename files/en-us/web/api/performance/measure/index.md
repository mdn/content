{{APIRef("User Timing API")}}

The **`measure()`** method creates a named {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp","timestamp")}} in the browser's _performance entry buffer_ between marks, the navigation start time, or the current time.

When measuring between two marks, there is a _start mark_ and _end mark_, respectively.
The named timestamp is referred to as a _measure_.

The `measure` can be retrieved using any of the {{domxref("Performance")}} interfaces:
({{domxref("Performance.getEntries","getEntries()")}},
{{domxref("Performance.getEntriesByName","getEntriesByName()")}} or
{{domxref("Performance.getEntriesByType","getEntriesByType()")}}).

## Syntax

```js
measure(measureName)
measure(measureName, MeasureOptions)
measure(measureName, startMark)
measure(measureName, startMark, endMark)
```

If only `measureName` is specified, the start timestamp is set to zero, and the end timestamp (which is used to calculate the duration) is the value that would be returned by {{domxref("Performance.now()")}}.

### Arguments

- `measureName`
  - : A {{domxref("DOMString")}} representing the name of the measure.

- `MeasureOptions` {{optional_inline}}
  - : An object that may contain all measure options (the `startMark` and `endMark` may be specified in this object or as their own arguments):

      - `detail`
        - : Arbitrary metadata to be included in the measure.
      - `start`
        - : Timestamp {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} to be used as the start time, or {{domxref("DOMString")}} to be used as start mark.
          If this represents the name of a start mark, then it is defined in the same way as `startMark` (in other words it must be the name of an existing mark or a {{domxref("PerformanceTiming")}} property).
      - `duration`
        - : Duration between the start and end mark times ({{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}}).
      - `end`
        - : Timestamp ({{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}}) to be used as the end time, or {{domxref("DOMString")}} to be used as end mark.
          If this represents the name of an end mark, then it is defined in the same way as `endMark` (in other words it must be the name of an existing mark or a {{domxref("PerformanceTiming")}} property).

- `startMark` {{optional_inline}}
  - : A {{domxref("DOMString")}} representing the name of the measure's starting mark.
    May also be the name of a {{domxref("PerformanceTiming")}} property.
    Specifying a name that does not represent an existing {{domxref('PerformanceMark')}} or {{domxref("PerformanceTiming")}} raises a `SyntaxError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}.

- `endMark` {{optional_inline}}
  - : A {{domxref("DOMString")}} representing the name of the measure's ending mark.
    This may also be the name of a {{domxref("PerformanceTiming")}} property.
    Specifying a name that does not represent an existing {{domxref('PerformanceMark')}} or {{domxref("PerformanceTiming")}} raises a `SyntaxError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}.

### Return value

The {{domxref("PerformanceMeasure")}} entry that was created.

The returned _measure_ will have the following property values:

- {{domxref("PerformanceEntry.entryType","entryType")}} - set to "`measure`".
- {{domxref("PerformanceEntry.name","name")}} - set to the "`name`" argument.
- {{domxref("PerformanceEntry.startTime","startTime")}} - set to:
  - a {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp","timestamp")}}, if specified in `MeasureOptions.start`.
  - the {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp","timestamp")}} of a start mark, if specified in `MeasureOptions.start` or `startMark`
  - a timestamp calculated from the `MeasureOptions.end` and `MeasureOptions.duration` (if `MeasureOptions.start` was not specified)
  - 0, if it isn't specified and can't be determined from other values.
  
- {{domxref("PerformanceEntry.duration","duration")}} - set to a {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} that is the duration of the measure calculated by subtracting the `startTime` from the end timestamp.

  The end timestamp is one of:
  - a {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp","timestamp")}}, if specified in `MeasureOptions.end`.
  - the {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp","timestamp")}} of an end mark, if one is specified in `MeasureOptions.end` or `endMark`
  - a timestamp calculated from the `MeasureOptions.start` and `MeasureOptions.duration` (if `MeasureOptions.end` was not specified)
  - the value returned by {{domxref("Performance.now()")}}, if no end mark is specified or can be determined from other values.
- {{domxref("PerformanceMeasure","detail")}} - set to the value passed in `MeasureOptions`.

## Exceptions

- `TypeError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : This can be thrown in any case where the start, end or duration might be ambiguous:
    
    - Both `endMark` and `MeasureOptions` are specified.
    - `MeasureOptions` is specified without either `start` and `end` members.
    - `MeasureOptions` is specified with all of `start`, `end`, and `duration` members (which might then be inconsistent).

- `SyntaxError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : The named mark does not exist.

    - An end mark is specified using either `endMark` or `MeasureOptions.end`, but there is no {{domxref('PerformanceMark')}} in the performance buffer with the matching name.
    - An end mark is specified using either `endMark` or `MeasureOptions.end`, but it cannot be converted to match that of a read only attribute in the {{domxref("PerformanceTiming")}} interface.
    - A start mark is specified using either `startMark` or `MeasureOptions.start`, but there is no {{domxref('PerformanceMark')}} in the performance buffer with the matching name.
    - A start mark is specified using either `startMark` or `MeasureOptions.start`, but it cannot be converted to match that of a read only attribute in the {{domxref("PerformanceTiming")}} interface.

- `DataCloneError` {{domxref("DOMException")}}
  - : The `MeasureOptions.detail` value is non-`null` and cannot be serialized using the HTML "StructuredSerialize" algorithm.

- `RangeError`
  - : The `MeasureOptions.detail` value is non-`null` and memory cannot be allocated during serialization using the HTML "StructuredSerialize" algorithm.

## Example

The following example shows how `measure()` is used to create a new _measure_ {{domxref("PerformanceEntry","performance entry")}} in the browser's performance entry buffer.

```js
const markerNameA = "example-marker-a"
const markerNameB = "example-marker-b"

// Run some nested timeouts, and create a PerformanceMark for each.
performance.mark(markerNameA);
setTimeout(function() {
  performance.mark(markerNameB);
  setTimeout(function() {

    // Create a variety of measurements.
    performance.measure("measure a to b", markerNameA, markerNameB);
    performance.measure("measure a to now", markerNameA);
    performance.measure("measure from navigation start to b", undefined, markerNameB);
    performance.measure("measure from navigation start to now");

    // Pull out all of the measurements.
    console.log(performance.getEntriesByType("measure"));

    // Finally, clean up the entries.
    performance.clearMarks();
    performance.clearMeasures();
  }, 1000);
}, 1000);
```
