<div>{{APIRef("High Resolution Timing")}}</div>

<p><span class="seoSummary">The <code><strong>performance.now()</strong></code> method
    returns a {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}}, measured in milliseconds.</span></p>

<p>{{AvailableInWorkers}}</p>

<p>The returned value represents the time elapsed since the <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMHighResTimeStamp#the_time_origin">time origin</a>.</p>

<p>Bear in mind the following points:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In dedicated workers created from a {{domxref("Window")}} context, the value in the
    worker will be lower than <code>performance.now()</code> in the window who spawned
    that worker. It used to be the same as <code>t0</code> of the main context, but this
    was changed.</li>
  <li>In shared or service workers, the value in the worker might be higher than that of
    the main context because that window can be created after those workers.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's important to keep in mind that to mitigate potential security threats such as <a
    href="https://spectreattack.com/">Spectre</a>, browsers typically round the returned
  value by some amount in order to be less predictable. This inherently introduces a
  degree of inaccuracy by limiting the resolution or precision of the timer. For example,
  Firefox rounds the returned time to 1 millisecond increments.</p>

<p>The precision of the returned value is subject to change if/when the security concerns
  are alleviated through other means.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush: js"><em>t</em> = performance.now();</pre>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<pre class="brush: js">const t0 = performance.now();
doSomething();
const t1 = performance.now();
console.log(`Call to doSomething took ${t1 - t0} milliseconds.`);
</pre>

<p>Unlike other timing data available to JavaScript (for example <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/now"><code>Date.now</code></a>),
  the timestamps returned by <code>performance.now()</code> are not limited to
  one-millisecond resolution. Instead, they represent times as floating-point numbers with
  up to microsecond precision.</p>

<p>Also unlike <code>Date.now()</code>, the values returned by
  <code>performance.now()</code> always increase at a constant rate, independent of the
  system clock (which might be adjusted manually or skewed by software like NTP).
  Otherwise, <code>performance.timing.navigationStart + performance.now()</code> will be
  approximately equal to <code>Date.now()</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Reduced_time_precision">Reduced time precision</h2>

<p>To offer protection against timing attacks and fingerprinting, the precision of
  <code>performance.now()</code> might get rounded depending on browser settings.<br>
  In Firefox, the <code>privacy.reduceTimerPrecision</code> preference is enabled by
  default and defaults to 1ms.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">// reduced time precision (1ms) in Firefox 60
performance.now();
// 8781416
// 8781815
// 8782206
// ...

// reduced time precision with `privacy.resistFingerprinting` enabled
performance.now();
// 8865400
// 8866200
// 8866700
// ...
</pre>

<p>In Firefox, you can also enable <code>privacy.resistFingerprinting</code> — this
  changes the precision to 100ms or the value of
  <code>privacy.resistFingerprinting.reduceTimerPrecision.microseconds</code>, whichever
  is larger.</p>

<p>Starting with Firefox 79, high resolution timers can be used if you cross-origin
  isolate your document using the {{HTTPHeader("Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy")}} and
  {{HTTPHeader("Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy")}} headers:</p>

<pre class="brush: plain">Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
</pre>

<p>These headers ensure a top-level document does not share a browsing context group with
  cross-origin documents. COOP process-isolates your document and potential attackers
  can't access to your global object if they were opening it in a popup, preventing a set
  of cross-origin attacks dubbed <a
