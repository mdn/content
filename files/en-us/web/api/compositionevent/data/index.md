{{APIRef("UI Events")}}

The **`data`** read-only property of the
{{domxref("CompositionEvent")}} interface returns the characters generated by the input
method that raised the event; its exact nature varies depending on the type of event
that generated the `CompositionEvent` object.

## Value

A string representing the event data:

- For `compositionstart` events, this is the currently selected text that
  will be replaced by the string being composed. This value doesn't change even if
  content changes the selection range; rather, it indicates the string that was selected
  when composition started.
- For `compositionupdate`, this is the string as it stands currently as
  editing is ongoing.
- For `compositionend` events, this is the string as committed to the
  editor.
