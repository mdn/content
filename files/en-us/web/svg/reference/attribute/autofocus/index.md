The **`autofocus`** global SVG attribute defines a focusable element to be focused after it's connected to a document. The attribute has no effect if the element is not already focusable.

The `autofocus` attribute has an HTML counterpart: [`autofocus`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/autofocus). No more than one element in the document may have the `autofocus` attribute. If applied to multiple elements, the first one will receive focus.

## Usage notes

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Value</th>
      <td>
        <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Boolean/HTML">boolean attribute</a></code>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Default value</th>
      <td>(none)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Animatable</th>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

For a description of the values, please refer to the [HTML `autofocus`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/autofocus) attribute.

## Accessibility concerns

Automatically focusing an SVG can confuse visually-impaired people using screen-reading technology and people with cognitive impairments. When autofocus is assigned, screen-readers "teleport" their user to the focusable element without warning them beforehand.

Use careful consideration for accessibility when applying the `autofocus` attribute. Automatically focusing on an element can cause the page to scroll on load. The focus can also cause dynamic keyboards to display on some touch devices. While a screen reader will announce the {{glossary("accessible name")}} of the element receiving focus, the screen reader will not announce anything before the element that may provide more context, and the sighted user on a small device will equally miss the context created by the preceding content.
