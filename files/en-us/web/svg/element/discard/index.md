{{SVGRef}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`<discard>`** [SVG](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) element may be used to specify the time at which a particular element should be removed from the DOM.
This allows an SVG viewer to conserve memory by discarding elements that are no longer needed, such as animated elements that have completed.

The operation removes the target element and all its children, and then the `<discard>` element itself (this happens even if the target element was invalid).

The [`begin`](#begin) attribute is used to specify the trigger point at which the `<discard>` element becomes active and its associated element is discarded.
The target element that is to be removed from the DOM is specified using the [`href`](#href) attribute.
If not specified, the immediate parent of the `<discard>` element is the target.

`<discard>` may be used in all the same places as the {{SVGElement('animate')}} element.
Authors should set the `playbackorder` attribute to `forwardonly` when using this element, as elements are not re-added if the user seeks backwards in the timeline.

## Attributes

- {{SVGAttr("begin")}}

  - : The trigger that causes the `<discard>` element to become active, at which point the associated element should be discarded.
    This is commonly a [`syncbase-value`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/begin#syncbase-value) indicating the start or end of another animation, an [`offset-value`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/begin#offset-value) relative to when the SVG file was loaded into the DOM, or an [`event-value`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/begin#event-value).

    _Value type_: [**\<begin-value-list>**](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/begin#animate_animatemotion_animatetransform_set).
    _Default value_: `0`; _Animatable_: **no**

- {{SVGAttr("href")}}

  - : An URL reference for the target element to discard.
    This has the same requirements as [`href` on animation elements](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/href#animate_animatemotion_animatetransform_set), and can be another `<discard>` element.
    If not defined, the target element is the immediate parent of the `<discard>` element.

    Note that if the target element is not part of the current SVG document fragment, whether or not it is discarded depends on the target language.

    _Default value_: `none`; _Animatable_: **no**

## Examples

### Discard triggered on the end of an animation

This example demonstrates how the `<discard>` element might be used with an activation triggered based on the completion of an animation.
The SVG used is based on Erik Dahlstr√∂m's "Loading bar" SVG at http://xn--dahlstrm-t4a.net/svg/smil/svgt12_discard.svg.

The SVG defines a "Load complete" {{svgelement("text")}} element that is hidden by a {{svgelement("g")}} element.

The `<rect>` is animated to the end of the bar over a duration of 4 seconds by the animation with id "barAnim".
The `<g>` element contains a discard element that is triggered by completion of the "barAnim" animation: `<discard begin="barAnim.end" />`.
When this activates the `<g>` element and all its contents are discarded from the DOM, leaving only the text block that displays "Load complete".

```html
<svg
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
  viewBox="0 0 100 50">
  <text
    x="50"
    y="30"
    font-family="sans-serif"
    font-size="10px"
    text-anchor="middle"
    stroke="white"
    stroke-width="0.2">
    Load complete
  </text>
  <g>
    <rect
      rx="5"
      x="10"
      y="15"
      height="20"
      width="80"
      fill="white"
      stroke="black" />
    <rect fill="lime" rx="3" x="12" y="17" height="16.1" width="10">
      <animate id="barAnim" attributeName="width" to="76" dur="4s" />
    </rect>
    <text
      x="50"
      y="30"
      font-family="sans-serif"
      font-size="10px"
      text-anchor="middle"
      stroke="white"
      stroke-width="0.2">
      Loading...
    </text>
    <discard begin="barAnim.end" />
  </g>
</svg>
```

#### Result

The live example below displays the SVG above in the top image, while the second image is the same SVG file but with the `<discard>` elements removed (on browsers that don't support the discard element both images will behave the same).

On the top image (on browsers that support the `<discard>` element) the bar and everything else in the `<g>` element will disappear after the bar reaches the end and is discarded, leaving only the "Load complete" text.
The lower image progress bar will simply revert to its initial state on completion of the animation, and the "Load complete" text will never get to display.

```html hidden
<button id="reset" type="button">Reset</button>
```

```js hidden
const reload = document.querySelector("#reset");

reload.addEventListener("click", () => {
  window.location.reload(true);
});
```

```html hidden
<img
  src="bar_discard_event.svg"
  alt="Animated progress bar SVG that uses discard triggered on the end of an animation" />
<img
  src="bar_no_discard.svg"
  alt="Animated progress bar SVG that does not include discard element" />
```

### Discard triggered on time

This example demonstrates how the `<discard>` element might be used with an activation triggered based on time.

It is almost exactly the same as the previous example, the main difference being that the discard element is triggered after 5 seconds (`<discard begin="5s" />`) instead of the the end of the animation (4 seconds). This also removes the id from the `<animate>` element, as it is not used.

```html
<svg
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
  viewBox="0 0 100 50">
  <text
    x="50"
    y="30"
    font-family="sans-serif"
    font-size="10px"
    text-anchor="middle"
    stroke="white"
    stroke-width="0.2">
    Load complete
  </text>
  <g>
    <rect
      rx="5"
      x="10"
      y="15"
      height="20"
      width="80"
      fill="white"
      stroke="black" />
    <rect fill="lime" rx="3" x="12" y="17" height="16.1" width="10">
      <animate attributeName="width" to="76" dur="4s" />
    </rect>
    <text
      x="50"
      y="30"
      font-family="sans-serif"
      font-size="10px"
      text-anchor="middle"
      stroke="white"
      stroke-width="0.2">
      Loading...
    </text>
    <discard begin="5s" />
  </g>
</svg>
```

#### Result

The live example below displays the SVG above in the top image, while the second image is the same SVG file but with the `<discard>` elements removed (on browsers that don't support the discard element both images will behave the same).

On the top image (on browsers that support the `<discard>` element) the bar will progress to completion after four seconds, and then revert to its initial state.
One second later everything in the `<g>` element will disappear, leaving only the "Load complete" text.
The lower image progress bar will simply revert to its initial state on completion of the animation, and the "Load complete" text will never get to display.

```html hidden
<button id="reset" type="button">Reset</button>
```

```js hidden
const reload = document.querySelector("#reset");

reload.addEventListener("click", () => {
  window.location.reload(true);
});
```

<img
