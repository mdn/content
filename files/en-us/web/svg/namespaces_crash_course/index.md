As an [XML](/en-US/docs/Glossary/XML) dialect, [SVG](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) is namespaced. It is important to understand the concept of namespaces and how they are used if you plan to author SVG content. Namespaces are essential to user agents that support multiple XML dialects; browsers must be very strict. Taking the time to understand namespaces now will save you from future headaches.

### Background

A long-standing goal of the various W3C specifications is to make it possible for different types of XML-based content to be mixed together in the same XML or HTML file. For example, SVG and [MathML](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML) might be incorporated directly into an HTML based scientific document. Being able to mix content types like this has many advantages, but it also required a very real problem to be solved.

Naturally, each XML dialect defines the meaning of the markup element names described in its specification. The problem with mixing content from different XML dialects in a single document is that the elements defined by one dialect may have the same name as elements defined by another. For example, both HTML and SVG have a `<title>` element. How does the user agent distinguish between the two? How do CSS styles distinguish between the two? In fact, how does the user agent tell when content is something it knows about, and not just a meaningless undefined HTML custom element or an XML file containing arbitrary element names unknown to it?

Contrary to popular opinion, the answer to this question is not "it can tell from the `DOCTYPE` declaration". DTDs were never designed with mixed content in mind, and past attempts to create mixed content DTDs are now considered to have failed. XML, and some XML dialects (SVG and HTML included), don't require a `DOCTYPE` declaration. SVG 1.2 doesn't even have one. The fact that `DOCTYPE` declarations (usually) match the content in single content-type files is merely coincidental. DTDs are for validation only, not identification of content. Any user agent that identifies XML content using its `DOCTYPE` declaration is unreliable.

The real answer to the question is that XML content tells the user agent which dialect the element names belong to by giving them explicit "namespace declarations".

### Declaring namespaces

So what do these namespace declarations look like, and where do they go? Here is a short example.

```svg
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <!-- more tags here -->
</svg>
```

The namespace declaration is provided by the `xmlns` parameter. This parameter says that the `<svg>` element and its child elements belong to whichever XML dialect has the namespace name `http://www.w3.org/2000/svg` which is, of course, SVG. Note that the namespace declaration is only provided once on a root element (and is implied if omitted). The declaration defines the _default_ namespace, so the user agent knows that all the `<svg>` element's descendants also belong to the same namespace. User agents check to see if they recognize the namespace name to determine if they know how to handle the markup.

Note that namespace names are just strings, so the fact that the SVG namespace name also looks like a URI isn't important. URIs are commonly used because they are unique, but the intention is not to "link" somewhere. (In fact, URIs are used so frequently that the term "namespace URI" is commonly used instead of "namespace name".)

#### Redeclaring the default namespace

If all the descendants of the root element are also defined to be in the default namespace, how do you mix in content from another namespace? To include the SVG namespace in HTML, you include `<svg>`. In XML, you declare a namespace. Here's a short example.

```xml
<report xmlns="https://www.acme.org/reports">
  <title>Some stats</title>
  <summary>...</summary>
  <statTable xmlns="https://www.acme.org/tables">
    <content>...</content>
    <!-- redeclaring root's default namespace -->
    <summary xmlns="https://www.acme.org/reports">...</summary>
  </statTable>
</report>
```

In this example, the `xmlns` attribute on the root `<report>` element declares the default namespace to be `https://www.acme.org/reports`, or `reports`. As a result, it and all its child elements are interpreted by the user agent as belonging to `reports`, except for the `<content>` element, which exists in the `https://www.acme.org/tables`, or `tables`, namespace. The `<summary>` element has its own `xmlns` parameter, and by redeclaring the `reports` namespace, this tells the user agent that the `<summary>` element and its descendants (unless they also redeclare an alternative namespace) belong to `reports`.

With HTML, `http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml` is the implied namespace. With SVG, it is `http://www.w3.org/2000/svg`. MathML is `http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML`.

#### Declaring namespace prefixes

XML dialects not only define their own elements, but they also declare their own parameters.

By default, parameters don't have a namespace at all. They are only known to be unique because they appear on an element that itself has a unique name. However, sometimes it is necessary to define parameters so that they can be reused on many different elements and still be considered to be the same parameter, independently of the element with which they are used. A very good example of this is the `href` parameter defined by the {{glossary("XLink")}} specification. This parameter is commonly used by other XML dialects as a means to link to external resources. But how do you tell the user agent which dialect the parameter belongs to, in this case `XLink`? Consider the following example.

```xml
<svg
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
  <script xlink:href="cool-script.js" type="text/ecmascript" />
</svg>
```

This example has the rather unusual-looking parameter `xmlns:xlink`. As you may guess from the first `xmlns` part, this is another namespace declaration. However, instead of setting the default namespace, this namespace declaration sets the namespace for something called a "[namespace prefix](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSNamespaceRule/prefix)". In this case, we have chosen to use the prefix `xlink` (the second part) since the prefix will be used to tell the user agent about attributes that belong to `XLink`.

As their name suggests, namespace prefixes are used to prefix parameter and element names. This is done by putting the namespace prefix and a colon before the parameter name as shown on the `<script>` element in the example above. This tells the user agent that the particular parameter belongs to the namespace assigned to the namespace prefix (`XLink`), and is a parameter that can be used with the same meaning on other elements.

Note that, in XML, it is an XML error to use a prefix that hasn't been bound to a namespace name. The binding created by the `xmlns:xlink` parameter in the example above is required for the `xlink:href` parameter to not cause an error. This XLink parameter is also frequently used in SVG on the `<a>`, `<use>` and `<image>` elements among others, so it's a good idea to always include the XLink declaration in your documents.

As an aside, it's useful to know that namespace prefixes can also be used for element names. This tells the user agent that the particular element (but not its children this time!) belongs to the namespace assigned to the prefix. Knowing this will save you some confusion if you come across markup like in the following example:

```html
<html
  lang="en"
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"
  xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <body>
    <h1>SVG embedded inline in XHTML</h1>
    <svg:svg width="300px" height="200px">
      <svg:circle cx="150" cy="100" r="50" fill="#ff0000" />
    </svg:svg>
  </body>
</html>
```

Note that because a namespace prefix is used for the `<svg:svg>` element and its child `<svg:circle>`, it wasn't necessary to redeclare the default namespace. In general, it is better to redeclare the default namespace rather than prefix lots of elements in this way.

### Scripting in namespaced XML

Namespaces affect markup and scripting ([and even CSS](/en-US/Docs/Web/CSS/CSS_namespaces/)). If you write scripts for namespaced XML such as SVG, read on.

The [DOM Level 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/) recommendation was created before the [original Namespaces in XML](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/) recommendation was released; therefore, DOM1 isn't namespace-aware. This causes problems for namespaced XML such as SVG. To resolve these problems, [DOM Level 2 Core](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/) added namespace-aware equivalents of all the applicable DOM Level 1 methods. When scripting SVG, it is important to use the [namespace-aware methods](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Core/core.html#Namespaces-Considerations). The table below lists the DOM1 methods that shouldn't be used in SVG, along with their equivalent DOM2 counterparts that should be used instead.

</table>

The first parameter for all the DOM2 namespace-aware methods must be the namespace name (also known as the namespace URI) of the element or parameter in question. For SVG **elements** this is `http://www.w3.org/2000/svg`. However, note carefully: the [Namespaces in XML 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/#defaulting) recommendation states that the namespace name for parameters without a prefix does not have a value. In other words, although the parameters belong to the namespace of the element, you do not use the tag's namespace name. Instead, **you must use null as the namespace name for unqualified (prefixless) parameters**. So, to create an SVG `rect` _element_ using `document.createElementNS()`, you must write:

```js
document.createElementNS("http://www.w3.org/2000/svg", "rect");
```

But to retrieve the value of the `x` _parameter_ on an SVG `rect` element, you must write:

```js
rect.getAttributeNS(null, "x");
```

Note that this isn't the case for parameters _with_ a namespace prefix (parameters that don't belong to the same XML dialect as the element). Parameters such as `xlink:href` require the namespace name that was assigned to that prefix (`http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink` for XLink). Hence to get the value of the `xlink:href` parameter of an `<a>` element in SVG you would write:

```js
elt.getAttributeNS("http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink", "href");
```

For setting parameters that have a namespace, it is recommended (but not required) that you also include their prefix in the second parameter so that the DOM can later be more easily converted back to XML (if, for instance, you want to send it back to the server). For example:

```js
elt.setAttributeNS(
  "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink",
  "xlink:href",
  "otherdoc.svg",
);
```

As a final example, here's a demonstration of how you could dynamically create an `<image>` element using JavaScript:

```js
const SVG_NS = "http://www.w3.org/2000/svg";
const XLink_NS = "http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink";
const image = document.createElementNS(SVG_NS, "image");
image.setAttributeNS(null, "width", "100");
image.setAttributeNS(null, "height", "100");
image.setAttributeNS(XLink_NS, "xlink:href", "flower.png");
```

### Conclusion

For SVG, HTML, and MathML, the namespace is implied and therefore optional. It is required to declare the namespace for XML files. If you don't, user agents will not recognize the content and will show the XML markup or inform the user that there's an error in the XML.

When writing SVG, it is helpful to use a template that includes all the commonly used namespace declarations when creating new files. If you don't already have one, make one up starting with the following code:

```html
<svg
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"></svg>
```

Even if you don't use all those namespaces in a particular document, there's no harm in including the namespace declarations. It may save you from some annoying errors if you end up adding content from one of the unused namespaces at a later date.
