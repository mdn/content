{{CSSRef("CSS3 Multicol")}}

**CSS Multi-column Layout** is a module of CSS that adds support for multi-column layouts. Support is included for establishing the number of columns in a layout, as well as how content should flow from column to column, gap sizes between columns, and column dividing lines (known as column rules) along with their appearance.

## Basic example

In the following example, the {{cssxref("column-count")}} property has been applied to the `<div>` element with the class `container`. As the value of `column-count` is `3`, the content is arranged into three columns of the same size.

## Relationship to fragmentation

Multiple-column layout is closely related to [Paged Media](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Pages), in that each column box becomes a fragment, much like a printed page becomes a fragment of an overall document. Therefore, the properties now defined in the [CSS Fragmentation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Fragmentation) specification are required to control how content breaks between columns.
