{{CSSRef}}

The `scroll-margin-inline` [shorthand property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties) sets the scroll margins of an element in the inline dimension.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/css/scroll-margin-inline.html")}}

## Constituent properties

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:

- [`scroll-margin-inline-end`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-margin-inline-end)
- [`scroll-margin-inline-start`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-margin-inline-start)

## Syntax

```css
/* <length> values */
scroll-margin-inline: 10px;
scroll-margin-inline: 1em 0.5em;

/* Global values */
scroll-margin-inline: inherit;
scroll-margin-inline: initial;
scroll-margin-inline: revert;
scroll-margin-inline: revert-layer;
scroll-margin-inline: unset;
```

### Values

- `<length>`
  - : An outset from the corresponding edge of the scroll container.

## Description

The scroll-margin values represent outsets defining the scroll snap area that is used for snapping this box to the snapport. The scroll snap area is determined by taking the transformed border box, finding its rectangular bounding box (axis-aligned in the scroll container's coordinate space), then adding the specified outsets.

## Examples

### Simple demonstration

This example implements something very similar to the interactive example above, except that here we'll explain to you how it's implemented.

The aim here is to create four horizontally-scrolling blocks, the second and third of which snap into place, near but not quite at the right of each block.

#### HTML

The HTML that represents the blocks is very simple:

```html
<div class="scroller">
  <div>1</div>
  <div>2</div>
  <div>3</div>
  <div>4</div>
</div>
```

#### CSS

Let's walk through the CSS. The outer container is styled like this:

```css
.scroller {
  text-align: left;
  width: 250px;
  height: 250px;
  overflow-x: scroll;
  display: flex;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  border: 1px solid #000;
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
}
```

The main parts relevant to the scroll snapping are `overflow-x: scroll`, which makes sure the contents will scroll and not be hidden, and `scroll-snap-type: x mandatory`, which dictates that scroll snapping must occur along the horizontal axis, and the scrolling will always come to rest on a snap point.

The child elements are styled as follows:

```css
.scroller > div {
  flex: 0 0 250px;
  width: 250px;
  background-color: #663399;
  color: #fff;
  font-size: 30px;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  scroll-snap-align: end;
}

.scroller > div:nth-child(2n) {
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #663399;
}
```

The most relevant part here is `scroll-snap-align: end`, which specifies that the right-hand edges (the "ends" along the x axis, in our case) are the designated snap points.

Last of all we specify the scroll margin values, a different one for the second and third child elements:

```css
.scroller > div:nth-child(2) {
  scroll-margin-inline: 1rem;
}

.scroller > div:nth-child(3) {
  scroll-margin-inline: 2rem;
}
```

This means that when scrolling past the middle child elements, the scrolling will snap to `1rem` outside the inline end edge of the second `<div>`, and `2rems` outside the inline end edge of the third `<div>`.

> **Note:** Here we are setting `scroll-margin` on the start _and_ end of the inline axis (x in our case), but only the end edge is really relevant. It would work just as well here to only set a scroll margin on that one edge, for example with `scroll-margin-inline: 0 1rem`, or `scroll-margin-inline-end: 1rem`.
