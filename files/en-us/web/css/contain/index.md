{{CSSRef}}

The **`contain`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property allows an author to indicate that an element and its contents are, as much as possible, _independent_ of the rest of the document tree. This allows the browser to recalculate layout, style, paint, size, or any combination of them for a limited area of the DOM and not the entire page, leading to obvious performance benefits.

This property is useful on pages that contain a lot of widgets that are all independent, as it can be used to prevent each widget's internals from having side effects outside of the widget's bounding-box.

> **Note:** If applied (with value: `paint`, `strict` or `content`), this property creates:
>
> 1.  A new [containing block](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_block) (for the descendants whose {{cssxref("position")}} property is `absolute` or `fixed`).
> 2.  A new [stacking context](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/The_stacking_context).
> 3.  A new [block formatting context](/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Block_formatting_context).

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
contain: none;
contain: strict;
contain: content;
contain: size;
contain: layout;
contain: style;
contain: paint;

/* Multiple keywords */
contain: size paint;
contain: size layout paint;

/* Global values */
contain: inherit;
contain: initial;
contain: revert;
contain: unset;
```

The `contain` property is specified as either one of the following:

- Using a single `none`, `strict`, or `content` keyword.
- Using one or more of the `size`, `layout`, `style`, and `paint` keywords in any order.

### Values

- `none`
  - : Indicates the element renders as normal, with no containment applied.
- `strict`
  - : Indicates that all containment rules except `style` are applied to the element. This is equivalent to `contain: size layout paint`.
- `content`
  - : Indicates that all containment rules except `size` and `style` are applied to the element. This is equivalent to `contain: layout paint`.
- `size`
  - : Indicates that the element can be sized without the need to examine its descendants' sizes.
- `layout`
  - : Indicates that nothing outside the element may affect its internal layout and vice versa.
- `style`
  - : Indicates that, for properties that can have effects on more than just an element and its descendants, those effects don't escape the containing element.
- `paint`
  - : Indicates that descendants of the element don't display outside its bounds. If the containing box is offscreen, the browser does not need to paint its contained elements — these must also be offscreen as they are contained completely by that box. And if a descendant overflows the containing element's bounds, then that descendant will be clipped to the containing element's border-box.

## Examples

### Simple layout

The markup below consists of a number of articles, each with content:

```html
<h1>My blog</h1>
<article>
  <h2>Heading of a nice article</h2>
  <p>Content here.</p>
</article>
<article>
  <h2>Another heading of another article</h2>
  <img src="graphic.jpg" alt="photo">
  <p>More content here.</p>
</article>
```

Each `<article>` and `<img>` is given a border, and the images are floated:

```css
img {
  float: left;
  border: 3px solid black;
}

article {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("css-examples/contain/simple-layout.html", '100%', 400)}}

You can immediately see an issue — no effort is made to clear the floating beyond the bottom of the article.

### Float interference

If we were to insert another image at the bottom of the first article, a large portion of the DOM tree may be re-laid out or repainted, and this would interfere further with the layout of the second article:

```html
<h1>My blog</h1>
<article>
  <h2>Heading of a nice article</h2>
  <p>Content here.</p>
  <img src="i-just-showed-up.jpg" alt="social">
</article>
<article>
  <h2>Another heading of another article</h2>
  <img src="graphic.jpg" alt="photo">
  <p>More content here.</p>
</article>
```

```css hidden
img {
  float: left;
  border: 3px solid black;
}

article {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

As you can see, because of the way floats work, the first image ends up inside the area of the second article:

### Fixing with contain

If we give each `article` the `contain` property with a value of `content`, when new elements are inserted the browser understands it only needs to recalculate the containing element's subtree, and not anything outside it:

```html hidden
<h1>My blog</h1>
<article>
  <h2>Heading of a nice article</h2>
  <p>Content here.</p>
  <img src="i-just-showed-up.jpg" alt="social">
</article>
<article>
  <h2>Another heading of another article</h2>
  <img src="graphic.jpg" alt="photo">
  <p>More content here.</p>
</article>
```

```css
img {
  float: left;
  border: 3px solid black;
}

article {
  border: 1px solid black;
  contain: content;
}
```

This also means that the first image no longer floats down to the second article, and instead stays inside its containing element's bounds:
