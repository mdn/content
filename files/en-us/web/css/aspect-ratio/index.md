{{CSSRef}}

The **`aspect-ratio`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property allows you to define the desired width-to-height ratio of an element's box. This means that even if the parent container or viewport size changes, the browser will adjust the element's dimensions to maintain the specified width-to-height ratio. The specified {{glossary("aspect ratio")}} is used in the calculation of auto sizes and some other layout functions.

At least one of the box's sizes needs to be automatic in order for `aspect-ratio` to have any effect. If neither the width nor height is an automatic size, then the provided aspect ratio has no effect on the box's preferred sizes.

## Syntax

```css
aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
aspect-ratio: 1;

/* fallback to 'auto' for replaced elements */
aspect-ratio: auto 3/4;
aspect-ratio: 9/6 auto;

/* Global values */
aspect-ratio: inherit;
aspect-ratio: initial;
aspect-ratio: revert;
aspect-ratio: revert-layer;
aspect-ratio: unset;
```

This property is specified as one or both of the keyword auto or a `<ratio>`. If both are given, then If the element is a [replaced element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element), such as [`<img>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img), then the given ratio is used until the content is loaded. After the content is loaded, the `auto` value is applied, so the intrinsic aspect ratio of the loaded content is used.

If the element is not a replaced element, then the given `ratio` is used.

### Values

- `auto`

  - : [Replaced elements](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element) with an intrinsic aspect ratio use _that_ aspect ratio, otherwise the box has no preferred aspect ratio. Size calculations involving intrinsic aspect ratio always work with the content box dimensions.

- {{cssxref("&lt;ratio&gt;")}}

  - : The box's preferred aspect ratio is the specified ratio of `width` / `height`. If `height` and the preceding slash character are omitted, `height` defaults to `1`. Size calculations involving preferred aspect ratio work with the dimensions of the box specified by `box-sizing`.

- `auto && <ratio>`

  - : When both `auto` and a `<ratio>` are specified together, `auto` is used if the element is a replaced element with a natural aspect ratio. Otherwise, the specified ratio of `width` / `height` is used as the preferred aspect ratio.

## Examples

### Exploring aspect-ratio effects with fixed width

In this example, the width of the `<div>` elements has been set to `100px` and height to `auto`. Since the width value is fixed here, the `aspect-ratio` property affects only the height of the `<div>` elements to maintain the specified width-to-height ratio.

```html hidden
<div>1/1</div>
<div>0.5</div>
<div>1</div>
<div>1/0.5</div>
<div>16/9</div>
```

```css hidden
div {
  display: inline-flex;
  background-color: lime;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

```css
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: auto;
}
div:nth-child(1) {
  aspect-ratio: 1/1;
}
div:nth-child(2) {
  aspect-ratio: 0.5;
}
div:nth-child(3) {
  aspect-ratio: 1;
}
div:nth-child(4) {
  aspect-ratio: 1/0.5;
}
div:nth-child(5) {
  aspect-ratio: 16/9;
}
```

### Fallback to natural aspect ratio

In this example we are using two`<img>` elements. The first element does not have its `src` attribute set to an image file.

```html
<img src="" /> <img src="plumeria.jpg" />
```

The following code sets `3/2` as the preferred aspect ratio and `auto` as a fallback.

```css
img {
  display: inline;
  width: 200px;
  border: 2px dashed red;
  background-color: lime;
  vertical-align: top;

  aspect-ratio: 3/2 auto;
}
```

Note how the first image without replaced content keeps the `3/2` aspect ratio, while the second image after the content is loaded uses the image's natural aspect ratio.
