The **`<hex-color>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Types) is a notation for describing the _hexadecimal color syntax_ of an [sRGB](/en-US/docs/Glossary/RGB) color using its primary color components (red, green, blue) written as hexadecimal numbers, as well as its transparency. It can be used everywhere a [`<color>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) type is allowed.

A `<hex-color>` value can be used everywhere where a [`<color>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) can be used.

## Syntax

```
#RGB        // The three-value syntax
#RGBA       // The four-value syntax
#RRGGBB     // The six-value syntax
#RRGGBBAA   // The eight-value syntax
```

### Value

- `R` or `RR`
  - : The _red_ component of the color, as a case-insensitive hexadecimal number between `0` and `ff` (255)). If there is only one number, it is duplicated: `1` means `11`.
- `G` or `GG`
  - : The _green_ component of the color, as a case-insensitive hexadecimal number between `0` and `ff` (255)). If there is only one number, it is duplicated: `c` means `cc`.
- `B` or `BB`
  - : The _blue_ component of the color, as a case-insensitive hexadecimal number between `0` and `ff` (255)). If there is only one number, it is duplicated: `9` means `99`.
- `A` or `AA` {{optional_inline}}
  - : The _alpha_ component of the color, indicating its transparency, as a case-insensitive hexadecimal number between `0` and `ff` (255)). If there is only one number, it is duplicated: `e` means `ee`. `0` represents a fully transparent color, and `ff` a fully opaque one.

> **Note:** The syntax is case-insensitive `#00ff00` is the same as `#00FF00`.
