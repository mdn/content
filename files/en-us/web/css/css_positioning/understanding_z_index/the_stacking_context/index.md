The **stacking context** is a three-dimensional conceptualization of HTML elements along an imaginary z-axis relative to the user, who is assumed to be facing the viewport or the webpage. HTML elements occupy this space in priority order based on element attributes.

## The stacking context

In the previous part of this article, [Using z-index](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/Adding_z-index), the rendering order of certain elements is influenced by their `z-index` value. This occurs because these elements have special properties which cause them to form a _stacking context_.

A stacking context is formed, anywhere in the document, by any element in the following scenarios:

- Root element of the document (`<html>`).
- Element with a {{cssxref("position")}} value `absolute` or `relative` and {{cssxref("z-index")}} value other than `auto`.
- Element with a {{cssxref("position")}} value `fixed` or `sticky` (sticky for all mobile browsers, but not older desktop).
- Element that is a child of a [flex](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) container, with {{cssxref("z-index")}} value other than `auto`.
- Element that is a child of a {{cssxref("grid")}} container, with {{cssxref("z-index")}} value other than `auto`.
- Element with a {{cssxref("opacity")}} value less than `1` (See [the specification for opacity](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-color/#transparency)).
- Element with a {{cssxref("mix-blend-mode")}} value other than `normal`.
- Element with any of the following properties with value other than `none`:

  - {{cssxref("transform")}}
  - {{cssxref("filter")}}
  - {{cssxref("perspective")}}
  - {{cssxref("clip-path")}}
  - {{cssxref("mask")}} / {{cssxref("mask-image")}} / {{cssxref("mask-border")}}

- Element with a {{cssxref("isolation")}} value `isolate`.
- Element with a {{cssxref("-webkit-overflow-scrolling")}} value `touch`.
- Element with a {{cssxref("will-change")}} value specifying any property that would create a stacking context on non-initial value (see [this post](http://dev.opera.com/articles/css-will-change-property/)).
- Element with a {{cssxref("contain")}} value of `layout`, or `paint`, or a composite value that includes either of them (i.e. `contain: strict`, `contain: content`).

Within a stacking context, child elements are stacked according to the same rules previously explained. Importantly, the `z-index` values of its child stacking contexts only have meaning in this parent. Stacking contexts are treated atomically as a single unit in the parent stacking context.

In summary:

- Stacking contexts can be contained in other stacking contexts, and together create a hierarchy of stacking contexts.
- Each stacking context is completely independent of its siblings: only descendant elements are considered when stacking is processed.
- Each stacking context is self-contained: after the element's contents are stacked, the whole element is considered in the stacking order of the parent stacking context.

> **Note:** The hierarchy of stacking contexts is a subset of the hierarchy of HTML elements because only certain elements create stacking contexts. We can say that elements that do not create their own stacking contexts are _assimilated_ by the parent stacking context.

## The example

![Example of stacking rules modified using z-index](understanding_zindex_04.png)

In this example, every positioned element creates its own stacking context, because of their positioning and `z-index` values. The hierarchy of stacking contexts is organized as follows:

- Root

  - DIV #1
  - DIV #2
  - DIV #3

    - DIV #4
    - DIV #5
    - DIV #6

It is important to note that DIV #4, DIV #5 and DIV #6 are children of DIV #3, so stacking of those elements is completely resolved within DIV#3. Once stacking and rendering within DIV #3 is completed, the whole DIV #3 element is passed for stacking in the root element with respect to its sibling's DIV.

> **Note:**
>
> - DIV #4 is rendered under DIV #1 because DIV #1's z-index (5) is valid within the stacking context of the root element, while DIV #4's z-index (6) is valid within the stacking context of DIV #3. So, DIV #4 is under DIV #1, because DIV #4 belongs to DIV #3, which has a lower z-index value.
> - For the same reason DIV #2 (z-index 2) is rendered under DIV#5 (z-index 1) because DIV #5 belongs to DIV #3, which has an higher z-index value.
> - DIV #3's z-index is 4, but this value is independent from z-index of DIV #4, DIV #5 and DIV #6, because it belongs to a different stacking context.
> - An easy way to figure out the _rendering order_ of stacked elements along the Z axis is to think of it as a "version number" of sorts, where child elements are minor version numbers underneath their parent's major version numbers. This way we can easily see how an element with a z-index of 1 (DIV #5) is stacked above an element with a z-index of 2 (DIV #2), and how an element with a z-index of 6 (DIV #4) is stacked below an element with a z-index of 5 (DIV #1). In our example (sorted according to the final rendering order):
>
>   - Root
>
>     - DIV #2 - z-index is 2
>     - DIV #3 - z-index is 4
>
>       - DIV #5 - z-index is 1, stacked under an element with a z-index of 4, which results in a rendering order of 4.1
>       - DIV #6 - z-index is 3, stacked under an element with a z-index of 4, which results in a rendering order of 4.3
>       - DIV #4 - z-index is 6, stacked under an element with a z-index of 4, which results in a rendering order of 4.6
>
>     - DIV #1 - z-index is 5

## Example

### HTML

```html
<div id="div1">
  <h1>Division Element #1</h1>
  <code>position: relative;<br/>
  z-index: 5;</code>
</div>

<div id="div2">
  <h1>Division Element #2</h1>
  <code>position: relative;<br/>
  z-index: 2;</code>
</div>

<div id="div3">
  <div id="div4">
    <h1>Division Element #4</h1>
    <code>position: relative;<br/>
    z-index: 6;</code>
  </div>

  <h1>Division Element #3</h1>
  <code>position: absolute;<br/>
  z-index: 4;</code>

  <div id="div5">
    <h1>Division Element #5</h1>
    <code>position: relative;<br/>
    z-index: 1;</code>
  </div>

  <div id="div6">
    <h1>Division Element #6</h1>
