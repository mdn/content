{{CSSRef}}

The **`view-transition-name`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property specifies the [view transition](/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) snapshot that selected elements will participate in, which enables an element to be animated separately from the rest of the page during a view transition.

## Syntax

```css
/* <custom-ident> value examples */
view-transition-name: header;
view-transition-name: figure-caption;

/* Keyword value */
view-transition-name: none;
view-transition-name: match-element;

/* Global values */
view-transition-name: inherit;
view-transition-name: initial;
view-transition-name: revert;
view-transition-name: revert-layer;
view-transition-name: unset;
```

### Values

- {{cssxref("custom-ident")}}
  - : An identifying name that causes the selected element to participate in a separate snapshot from the root snapshot. The `<custom-ident>` cannot be `auto`, `match-element`, `none`, or a [CSS-wide keyword](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Values_and_Units/CSS_data_types#css-wide_keywords) value.
- `match-element`
  - : The selected element is automatically given a unique identifying name. This name enables the element to be snapshotted separately from all other elements on the page and is not visible to the web document.
- `none`
  - : The selected element will not participate in a separate snapshot, unless it has a parent element with a `view-transition-name` set, in which case it will be snapshotted as part of that element.

## Description

By default, when a view transition is applied to a web app, all changes to the UI that occur during that transition are snapshotted and animated together. This is the default — or `root` — snapshot (see [The view transition pseudo-element tree](/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API/Using#the_view_transition_pseudo-element_tree)). By default, this animation is a smooth cross-fade, which can be seen in action in the [View Transitions SPA demo](https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/view-transitions/spa/).

If you want certain elements to be animated differently from the `root` snapshot during the view transition, you can do so by giving them a different `view-transition-name`, for example:

```css
figcaption {
  view-transition-name: figure-caption;
}
```

You can then specify which animations you want for the before and after snapshots using the relevant view transition pseudo-elements — {{cssxref("::view-transition-old()")}} and {{cssxref("::view-transition-new()")}}. For example:

```css
::view-transition-old(figure-caption) {
  animation: 0.25s linear both shrink-x;
}

::view-transition-new(figure-caption) {
  animation: 0.25s 0.25s linear both grow-x;
}
```

If you don't want an element to be snapshotted separately, you can specify a `view-transition-name` value of `none`:

```css
.dont-animate-me {
  view-transition-name: none;
}
```

The `view-transition-name` `<custom-ident>` must be unique for each rendered element taking part in the view transition. If two rendered elements have the same `view-transition-name` at the same time, the {{domxref("ViewTransition.ready")}} {{JSxRef("Promise")}} will reject and the transition will be skipped.

### Specifying `view-transition-name` values automatically

Sometimes you will want to animate multiple UI elements separately in a view transition. This is often the case when you have a list of elements on a page and want to rearrange them in some way:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
  <li>Item 3</li>
  <li>Item 4</li>

  <!-- ... -->

  <li>Item 99</li>
</ul>
```

Giving each one a unique name can be inconvenient, especially as the number of elements gets larger:

```css-nolint
li:nth-child(1) {
  view-transition-name: item1;
}
li:nth-child(2) {
  view-transition-name: item2;
}
li:nth-child(3) {
  view-transition-name: item3;
}
li:nth-child(4) {
  view-transition-name: item4;
}

/* ... */

li:nth-child(99) {
  view-transition-name: item99;
}
```

To get around this problem, you can use the `match-element` value, which causes the browser to give each selected element a unique internal `view-transition-name`:

```css
li {
  view-transition-name: match-element;
}
```

Because `match-element` assigns automatic `view-transition-name` values based on element identity, it can only be used for same-document view transitions. The auto-generated internal identifiers are not transferrable across different elements or documents.

## Examples

### Basic `view-transition-name` usage

This example comes from the [View Transitions SPA demo](https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/view-transitions/spa/), which is a basic image gallery. The [Basic SPA view transition](/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API/Using#basic_spa_view_transition) provides a more detailed explanation of how this demo works.

Most of the UI changes are animated using the `root` transition snapshot. However, the `<figcaption>` is given a `view-transition-name` of `figure-caption` to allow it to be animated differently from the rest of the page:

```css
figcaption {
  view-transition-name: figure-caption;
}
```

The following code applies a custom animation just to the `<figcaption>`:

```css
@keyframes grow-x {
  from {
    transform: scaleX(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: scaleX(1);
  }
}

@keyframes shrink-x {
  from {
    transform: scaleX(1);
  }
  to {
    transform: scaleX(0);
  }
}

::view-transition-group(figure-caption) {
  height: auto;
  right: 0;
  left: auto;
  transform-origin: right center;
}

::view-transition-old(figure-caption) {
  animation: 0.25s linear both shrink-x;
}

::view-transition-new(figure-caption) {
  animation: 0.25s 0.25s linear both grow-x;
}
```

We create a custom CSS animation and apply it to the `::view-transition-old(figure-caption)` and `::view-transition-new(figure-caption)` pseudo-elements. We also apply other styles to keep them both in the same place and to stop the default styling from interfering with our custom animations.

### Using the `match-element` value

The [View Transitions match-element demo](https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/view-transitions/match-element/) contains a list of content items in a sidebar with a large main content space beside it. The headings inside the list items can be clicked, which will cause them to animate into the main content space and show all their content.

#### HTML

The {{htmlelement("main")}} element contains an [unordered list](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/ul) and an {{htmlelement("article")}} element. The multiple child {{htmlelement("li")}} elements inside the list each contain an {{htmlelement("a")}} element inside a [heading](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/Heading_Elements).

```html
<main class="match-element-applied">
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h2><a href="#">One</a></h2>

      ...
    </li>
    <li>...</li>

    ...
  </ul>
  <article></article>
</main>
```

#### CSS

We use [flexbox](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) to lay out the list and the `<article>` side-by-side, and to cause the list items to all take up an equal amount of space in the left-hand column. The list has a fixed width, while the `<article>` takes up the rest of the available horizontal space.

```css
main {
  height: calc(100% - 80px);
  display: flex;
  gap: 10px;
  position: relative;
}

ul {
  width: 300px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  gap: 10px;
}

article {
  flex: 1;
}

li {
  flex: 1;
}
```

We also define a rule that selects elements with the `active-item` class. When this class is applied to an element, the rule causes it to be positioned exactly over the top of the `<article>` element. This class will be applied to the list items via JavaScript when their links are clicked, which will initiate a view transition.

```css
.active-item {
  position: absolute;
  z-index: 1;
  translate: 310px;
  width: calc(100% - 310px);
  height: 100%;
}
```

By default, all the rendered elements involved in the view transition are animated together in one cross-fade. However, in this case, we don't want this — we want to give each list item an individual movement animation. We can achieve this by applying `view-transition-name: match-element` to every list item:

```css
.match-element-applied li {
  view-transition-name: match-element;
}
```

The `match-element-applied` class is applied to the `<main>` element. When looking at the [live demo](https://mdn.github.io/dom-examples/view-transitions/match-element/), you can remove this class by unchecking the checkbox in the bottom-right corner of the UI. This allows you to compare the singular cross-fade animation you get without `view-transition-name: match-element` to the individual movement animations you get when it is applied.

We also use the {{cssxref("::view-transition-group()")}} pseudo-element to apply an {{cssxref("animation-duration")}} to all the view transition groups (signified by the `*` identifier) and give all the old and new snapshots a {{cssxref("height")}} of `100%` to work around differences in their aspect ratios and make the animations look smoother:

```css
::view-transition-group(*) {
  animation-duration: 0.5s;
}

html::view-transition-old(*),
html::view-transition-new(*) {
  height: 100%;
}
```

#### JavaScript

The demo's JavaScript applies the `active-item` class to the list items when their links are clicked; this is achieved via the `updateActiveItem()` function:

```js
function updateActiveItem(event) {
  // A reference to the list item containing the link that was clicked
  const clickedElem = event.target.parentElement.parentElement;

  // Set the active-item class on the list item
  clickedElem.className = "active-item";

  // Keep track of the previous item that was clicked, if any.
  // Remove the active-item class from the previous item so that only
  // one list item is placed over the <article> at any one time
  if (prevElem === clickedElem) {
    prevElem.className = "";
    prevElem = undefined;
  } else if (prevElem) {
    prevElem.className = "";
    prevElem = clickedElem;
  } else {
    prevElem = clickedElem;
  }
}

mainElem.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
  // Don't do anything unless a link is clicked inside the <main> element
  if (event.target.tagName !== "A") {
    return;
  }

  // Run updateActiveItem() on its own if view transitions are not supported
  if (!document.startViewTransition) {
    updateActiveItem(event);
  } else {
    // Run updateActiveItem() via startViewTransition()
    const transition = document.startViewTransition(() =>
      updateActiveItem(event),
    );
  }
});
```

Running the `updateActiveItem()` function via the `startViewTransition()` function causes the UI changes to animate smoothly.
