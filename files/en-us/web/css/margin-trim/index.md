The `margin-trim` property allows the container to trim the margins of its children where they adjoin the container's edges.

## Syntax

```css
margin-trim: none;
margin-trim: block;
margin-trim: block-start;
margin-trim: block-end;
margin-trim: inline;
margin-trim: inline-start;
margin-trim: inline-end;

/* Global values */
margin-trim: inherit;
margin-trim: initial;
margin-trim: revert;
margin-trim: revert-layer;
margin-trim: unset;
```

## Values

- `none`

  - : Margins are not trimmed by the container.

- `block`

  - : Margins provided to the block children where they adjoin the container's edges are trimmed to zero without affecting the margins provided to the container.

- `block-start`

  - : Margin of the first block child with the container's edge is trimmed to zero.

- `block-end`

  - : Margin of last block child with the container's edge is trimmed to zero.

- `inline`

  - : Margins provided to the inline children where they adjoin the container's edges are trimmed to zero, without affecting the spacing at the beginning and end of the row.

- `inline-start`

  - : Margin between the container's edge and the first inline child is trimmed to zero.

- `inline-end`
  - : Margin between the container's edge and the last inline child is trimmed to zero.

### Basic usage

Once support is implemented for this property, it will probably work like so:

When you've got a container with some inline children and you want to put a margin between each child but not have it interfere with the spacing at the end of the row, you might do something like this:

```css
article {
  background-color: red;
  margin: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
  display: inline-block;
}

article > span {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
  text-align: center;
  padding: 10px;
  margin-right: 20px;
  margin-left: 30px;
}
```

The problem here is that you'd end up with 20px too much spacing at the right of the row, so you'd maybe do this to fix it:

```css
span:last-child {
  margin-right: 0;
  margin-left: 0;
}
```

It is a pain having to write another rule to achieve this, and it is also not very flexible. Instead, `margin-trim` could fix it:

```css
article {
  margin-trim: inline-end;
  /* … */
}
```

Similarly, to remove left margin with the container's edge:

```css
article {
  margin-trim: inline-start;
  /* … */
}
```
