{{CSSRef}}

The **`view-transition-class`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property provides the selected elements with an identifying class (a {{cssxref("custom-ident")}}) and causes them to participate in a shared [view transition](/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API), separate from the root view transition — or no view transition if the `none` value is specified.

> [!NOTE]
> Each individual element still needs its own unique {{cssxref("view-transition-name")}}. In browsers that don't support `view-transition-class`, you would also need to have a custom `::view-transition-group` for each element. Support for determining the `view-transition-name` automatically is being discussed in the [CSS View Transitions Module Level 2](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-view-transitions-2/#auto-vt-name) spec.

## Syntax

```css
/* <custom-ident> value examples */
view-transition-class: card;

/* Keyword value */
view-transition-class: none;
```

### Values

- {{cssxref("custom-ident")}}
  - : An identifying name that causes the selected element to participate in a separate [view transition](/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) from the root view transition. The identifier must be unique. If two rendered elements have the same `view-transition-name` at the same time, {{domxref("ViewTransition.ready")}} will reject and the transition will be skipped.
    > [!NOTE]
    > The `<custom-ident>` cannot be `auto`.
- `none`
  - : The selected element will not participate in a view transition.
