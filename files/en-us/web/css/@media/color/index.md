The **`color`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [media feature](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media#media_features) can be used to test the number of bits per color component (red, green, blue) of the output device.

## Syntax

The `color` feature is specified as an {{cssxref("&lt;integer&gt;")}} value that represents the number of bits per color component (red, green, blue) of the output device. If the device is not a color device, the value is zero. It is a range feature, meaning that you can also use the prefixed **`min-color`** and **`max-color`** variants to query minimum and maximum values, respectively.

> **Note:** If the various color components are represented by different numbers of bits, the smallest number is used. For example, if a display uses 5 bits for blue and red and 6 bits for green, then the device is considered to use 5 bits per color component. If the device uses indexed colors, the minimum number of bits per color component in the color table is used.

See [Applying color to HTML elements using CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Applying_color) to learn more about using CSS to apply color to HTML.

## Examples

### HTML

```html
<p>
  This text should be black on non-color devices, red on devices with a low
  number of colors, and greenish on devices with a high number of colors.
</p>
```

### CSS

```css
p {
  color: black;
}

/* Any color device */
@media (color) {
  p {
    color: red;
  }
}

/* Any color device with at least 8 bits per color component */
@media (min-color: 8) {
  p {
    color: #24ba13;
  }
}
```
