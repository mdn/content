{{CSSRef}}

The **`prefers-color-scheme`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [media feature](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries#targeting_media_features) is used to detect if a user has requested light or dark color themes.
A user indicates their preference through an operating system setting (e.g. light or dark mode) or a user agent setting.

## Embedded elements

For SVG and iframes, `prefers-color-scheme` lets you set a CSS style for the SVG or iframe based on the [`color-scheme`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme) of the parent element in the web page.
SVGs must be used embedded (i.e., `<img src="circle.svg" alt="circle" />`) as opposed to [inlined in HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/SVG_In_HTML_Introduction#basic_example).
An example of using `prefers-color-scheme` in SVGs can be found in in the [Color scheme inheritance](#color_scheme_inheritance) section.

Using `prefers-color-scheme` is allowed in [cross-origin](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy#cross-origin_network_access) `<svg>` and `<iframe>` elements. Cross-origin elements are elements retrieved from a different host than the page that is referencing them.
To learn more about SVGs, see the [SVG documentation](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) and for more information about iframes, see the [iframe documentation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe).

## Syntax

- `light`
  - : Indicates that user has notified that they prefer an interface that has a light theme, or has not expressed an active preference.
- `dark`
  - : Indicates that user has notified that they prefer an interface that has a dark theme.

## Examples

### Detecting a dark theme

The elements below have an initial color theme.
They can be further themed according to the user's color scheme preference.

```html
<div class="day">Day (initial)</div>
<div class="day light-scheme">Day (changes in light scheme)</div>
<div class="day dark-scheme">Day (changes in dark scheme)</div>
<br />

<div class="night">Night (initial)</div>
<div class="night light-scheme">Night (changes in light scheme)</div>
<div class="night dark-scheme">Night (changes in dark scheme)</div>
```

The following CSS is used to style the elements above:

```css
.day {
  background: #eee;
  color: black;
}
.night {
  background: #333;
  color: white;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  .day.dark-scheme {
    background: #333;
    color: white;
  }
  .night.dark-scheme {
    background: black;
    color: #ddd;
  }
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  .day.light-scheme {
    background: white;
    color: #555;
  }
  .night.light-scheme {
    background: #eee;
    color: black;
  }
}

.day,
.night {
  display: inline-block;
  padding: 1em;
  width: 7em;
  height: 2em;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```

### Color scheme inheritance

The following example shows how to use `prefers-color-scheme` with the [`color-scheme` property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color-scheme) inherited from a parent element.
A script is used to set the source of the `<img>` elements and their `alt` attributes. This would normally be done in HTML as `<img src="circle.svg" alt="circle" />`.

You should see three circles, with one drawn in a different color.
The first circle inherits the `color-scheme` from the OS and can be toggled using the system OS's theme switcher.

The second and third circles inherit the `color-scheme` from the embedding element; the `@media` query allows setting styles of the SVG content based on the parent element's `color-scheme`.
In this case, the parent element with a `color-scheme` CSS property is a `<div>`.

```html
<div>
  <img />
</div>

<div style="color-scheme: light">
  <img />
</div>
<div style="color-scheme: dark">
  <img />
</div>

<!-- Embed an SVG for all <img> elements -->
<script>
  for (let img of document.querySelectorAll("img")) {
    img.alt = "circle";
    img.src =
      "data:image/svg+xml;base64," +
      btoa(`
      <svg width="32" height="32" viewBox="0 0 32 32" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
        <style>
          :root { color: blue }
          @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
            :root { color: purple }
          }
        </style>
        <circle fill="currentColor" cx="16" cy="16" r="16"/>
      </svg>
    `);
  }
</script>
```
