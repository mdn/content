{{CSSRef}}

The **`orphans`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the minimum number of lines in a block container that must be shown at the _bottom_ of a [page](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Paged_Media), region, or [column](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Columns).

```css
/* <integer> values */
orphans: 2;
orphans: 3;

/* Global values */
orphans: inherit;
orphans: initial;
orphans: revert;
orphans: revert-layer;
orphans: unset;
```

In typography, an _orphan_ is the first line of a paragraph that appears alone at the bottom of a page. (The paragraph continues on a following page.)
