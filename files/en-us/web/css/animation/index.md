{{CSSRef}}

The **`animation`** [shorthand](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties) [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property applies an animation between styles. It is a shorthand for {{cssxref("animation-name")}}, {{cssxref("animation-duration")}}, {{cssxref("animation-timing-function")}}, {{cssxref("animation-delay")}}, {{cssxref("animation-iteration-count")}}, {{cssxref("animation-direction")}}, {{cssxref("animation-fill-mode")}}, and {{cssxref("animation-play-state")}}.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/css/animation.html")}}

```css
/* @keyframes duration | easing-function | delay |
iteration-count | direction | fill-mode | play-state | name */
animation: 3s ease-in 1s 2 reverse both paused slidein;

/* @keyframes name | duration | easing-function | delay */
animation: slidein 3s linear 1s;

/* @keyframes name | duration */
animation: slidein 3s;
```

A [description of which properties are animatable](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animated_properties) is available; it's worth noting that this description is also valid for [CSS transitions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions).

## Constituent properties

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:

- [`animation-delay`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-delay)
- [`animation-direction`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-direction)
- [`animation-duration`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-duration)
- [`animation-fill-mode`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-fill-mode)
- [`animation-iteration-count`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-iteration-count)
- [`animation-name`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-name)
- [`animation-play-state`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-play-state)
- [`animation-timing-function`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timing-function)

## Syntax

The `animation` property is specified as one or more single animations, separated by commas.

Each individual animation is specified as:

- zero or one occurrences of the following values:

  - {{cssxref("&lt;single-transition-easing-function&gt;")}}
  - {{cssxref("animation", "&lt;single-animation-iteration-count&gt;", "#single-animation-iteration-count")}}
  - {{cssxref("animation", "&lt;single-animation-direction&gt;", "#single-animation-direction")}}
  - {{cssxref("animation", "&lt;single-animation-fill-mode&gt;", "#single-animation-fill-mode")}}
  - {{cssxref("animation", "&lt;single-animation-play-state&gt;", "#single-animation-play-state")}}

- an optional name for the animation, which may be `none`, a {{cssxref("&lt;custom-ident&gt;")}}, or a {{cssxref("&lt;string&gt;")}}
- zero, one, or two {{cssxref("&lt;time&gt;")}} values

The order of values within each animation definition is important: the first value that can be parsed as a {{cssxref("&lt;time&gt;")}} is assigned to the {{cssxref("animation-duration")}}, and the second one is assigned to {{cssxref("animation-delay")}}.

The order within each animation definition is also important for distinguishing {{cssxref("animation-name")}} values from other keywords. When parsed, keywords that are valid for properties other than {{cssxref("animation-name")}}, and whose values were not found earlier in the shorthand, must be accepted for those properties rather than for {{cssxref("animation-name")}}. Furthermore, when serialized, default values of other properties must be output in at least the cases necessary to distinguish an {{cssxref("animation-name")}} that could be a value of another property, and may be output in additional cases.

### Values

- `<single-animation-iteration-count>`
  - : The number of times the animation is played. The value must be one of those available in {{cssxref("animation-iteration-count")}}.
- `<single-animation-direction>`
  - : The direction in which the animation is played. The value must be one of those available in {{cssxref("animation-direction")}}.
- `<single-animation-fill-mode>`
  - : Determines how styles should be applied to the animation's target before and after its execution. The value must be one of those available in {{cssxref("animation-fill-mode")}}.
- `<single-animation-play-state>`
  - : Determines whether the animation is playing or not. The value must be one of those available in {{cssxref("animation-play-state")}}.

## Accessibility concerns

Blinking and flashing animation can be problematic for people with cognitive concerns such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Additionally, certain kinds of motion can be a trigger for Vestibular disorders, epilepsy, and migraine and Scotopic sensitivity.

Consider providing a mechanism for pausing or disabling animation, as well as using the [Reduced Motion Media Query](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion) to create a complimentary experience for users who have expressed a preference for no animated experiences.

## Examples

> **Note:** Animating [CSS Box Model](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model) properties is discouraged. Animating any box model property is inherently CPU intensive; consider animating the [transform](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) property instead.

### Sun Rise

Here we animate a yellow sun across a light blue sky. The sun rises
to the center of the viewport and then falls out of sight.

```html
<div class="sun"></div>
```

```css
:root {
  overflow: hidden; /* hides any part of the sun below the horizon */
  background-color: lightblue;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* centers the sun in the background */
}

.sun {
  background-color: yellow;
  border-radius: 50%; /* creates a circular background */
  height: 100vh; /* makes the sun the size of the viewport */
  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
  animation: 4s linear 0s infinite alternate sun-rise;
}

@keyframes sun-rise {
  from {
    /* pushes the sun down past the viewport */
    transform: translateY(110vh);
  }
  to {
    /* returns the sun to its default position */
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

### Animating Multiple Properties

Adding onto the sun animation in the previous example, we add a second animation changing the color of the sun as it rises and sets. The sun starts off dark red when it is below the horizon and changes to a bright orange as it reaches the top.

```html
<div class="sun"></div>
```

```css
:root {
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: lightblue;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

.sun {
  background-color: yellow;
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 100vh;
  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
  animation: 4s linear 0s infinite alternate animating-multiple-properties;
}

/* it is possible to animate multiple properties in a single animation */
@keyframes animating-multiple-properties {
  from {
    transform: translateY(110vh);
    background-color: red;
    filter: brightness(75%);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(0);
    background-color: orange;
    /* unset properties i.e. 'filter' will revert to default values */
  }
}
```

### Applying Multiple Animations

Here is a sun that rises and falls on a lightblue background. The sun
gradually rotates through a rainbow of colors. The timing of the sun's
position and color are independent.

```html
<div class="sun"></div>
```

```css
:root {
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: lightblue;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

.sun {
  background-color: yellow;
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 100vh;
  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
  /* multiple animations are separated by commas */
  animation:
    4s linear 0s infinite alternate rise,
    /* animation parameters are set independently */
    24s linear 0s infinite psychedelic;
}

@keyframes rise {
  from {
    transform: translateY(110vh);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}

@keyframes psychedelic {
  from {
    filter: hue-rotate(0deg);
  }
  to {
    filter: hue-rotate(360deg);
  }
}
```

### Cascading Multiple Animations

Here is a yellow sun on a lightblue background. The sun bounces between the
left and right sides of the viewport. The sun remains in the viewport even
though a rise animation is defined. The rise animation's transform property
is 'overwritten' by the bounce animation.

```html
<div class="sun"></div>
```

```css
:root {
  overflow: hidden;
  background-color: lightblue;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
}

.sun {
  background-color: yellow;
  border-radius: 50%;
  height: 100vh;
  aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
  /*
    animations declared later in the cascade will override the
    properties of previously declared animations
  */
  animation:
    4s linear 0s infinite alternate rise,
    /* bounce 'overwrites' the transform set by rise */
    4s linear 0s infinite alternate bounce;
    /* hence the sun only moves horizontally */
}

@keyframes rise {
  from {
    transform: translateY(110vh);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}

@keyframes bounce {
  from {
    transform: translateX(-50vw);
  }
  to {
    transform: translateX(50vw);
  }
}
```
