{{CSSRef}}

The **`animation`** [shorthand](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Shorthand_properties) [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property applies an animation between styles. It is a shorthand for {{cssxref("animation-name")}}, {{cssxref("animation-duration")}}, {{cssxref("animation-timing-function")}}, {{cssxref("animation-delay")}}, {{cssxref("animation-iteration-count")}}, {{cssxref("animation-direction")}}, {{cssxref("animation-fill-mode")}}, and {{cssxref("animation-play-state")}}.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/css/animation.html")}}

```css
/* @keyframes duration | easing-function | delay |
iteration-count | direction | fill-mode | play-state | name */
animation: 3s ease-in 1s 2 reverse both paused slidein;

/* @keyframes name | duration | easing-function | delay */
animation: slidein 3s linear 1s;

/* @keyframes name | duration */
animation: slidein 3s;
```

A [description of which properties are animatable](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions#which_css_properties_are_animatable) is available; it's worth noting that this description is also valid for [CSS transitions](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Transitions/Using_CSS_transitions).

## Constituent properties

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:

- [`animation-delay`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-delay)
- [`animation-direction`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-direction)
- [`animation-duration`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-duration)
- [`animation-fill-mode`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-fill-mode)
- [`animation-iteration-count`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-iteration-count)
- [`animation-name`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-name)
- [`animation-play-state`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-play-state)
- [`animation-timing-function`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timing-function)

## Syntax

The `animation` property is specified as one or more single animations, separated by commas.

Each individual animation is specified as:

- zero or one occurrences of the following values:

  - {{cssxref("&lt;single-transition-easing-function&gt;")}}
  - {{cssxref("animation", "&lt;single-animation-iteration-count&gt;", "#&lt;single-animation-iteration-count&gt;")}}
  - {{cssxref("animation", "&lt;single-animation-direction&gt;", "#&lt;single-animation-direction&gt;")}}
  - {{cssxref("animation", "&lt;single-animation-fill-mode&gt;", "#&lt;single-animation-fill-mode&gt;")}}
  - {{cssxref("animation", "&lt;single-animation-play-state&gt;", "#&lt;single-animation-play-state&gt;")}}

- an optional name for the animation, which may be `none`, a {{cssxref("&lt;custom-ident&gt;")}}, or a {{cssxref("&lt;string&gt;")}}
- zero, one, or two {{cssxref("&lt;time&gt;")}} values

The order of values within each animation definition is important: the first value that can be parsed as a {{cssxref("&lt;time&gt;")}} is assigned to the {{cssxref("animation-duration")}}, and the second one is assigned to {{cssxref("animation-delay")}}.

The order within each animation definition is also important for distinguishing {{cssxref("animation-name")}} values from other keywords. When parsed, keywords that are valid for properties other than {{cssxref("animation-name")}}, and whose values were not found earlier in the shorthand, must be accepted for those properties rather than for {{cssxref("animation-name")}}. Furthermore, when serialized, default values of other properties must be output in at least the cases necessary to distinguish an {{cssxref("animation-name")}} that could be a value of another property, and may be output in additional cases.

### Values

- `<single-animation-iteration-count>`
  - : The number of times the animation is played. The value must be one of those available in {{cssxref("animation-iteration-count")}}.
- `<single-animation-direction>`
  - : The direction in which the animation is played. The value must be one of those available in {{cssxref("animation-direction")}}.
- `<single-animation-fill-mode>`
  - : Determines how styles should be applied to the animation's target before and after its execution. The value must be one of those available in {{cssxref("animation-fill-mode")}}.
- `<single-animation-play-state>`
  - : Determines whether the animation is playing or not. The value must be one of those available in {{cssxref("animation-play-state")}}.

## Accessibility concerns

Blinking and flashing animation can be problematic for people with cognitive concerns such as Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Additionally, certain kinds of motion can be a trigger for Vestibular disorders, epilepsy, and migraine and Scotopic sensitivity.

Consider providing a mechanism for pausing or disabling animation, as well as using the [Reduced Motion Media Query](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion) to create a complimentary experience for users who have expressed a preference for no animated experiences.

### Quantum CSS notes

- Gecko has a bug whereby when you animate an offscreen element onscreen but specify a delay, Gecko does not repaint on some platforms, e.g. Windows ({{bug(1383239)}}). This has been fixed in Firefox's new parallel CSS engine (also known as [Quantum CSS](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Quantum) or [Stylo](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Quantum/Stylo), planned for release in Firefox 57).
- Another Gecko bug means that {{htmlelement("details")}} elements can't be made open by default using the `open` attribute if they have an animation active on them ({{bug(1382124)}}). Quantum CSS fixes this.
- A further bug means that animations using em units are not affected by changes to the {{cssxref("font-size")}} on the animated element's parent, whereas they should be ({{bug(1254424)}}). Quantum CSS fixes this.
