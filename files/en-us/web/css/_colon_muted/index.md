{{CSSRef}}

The **`:muted`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-class](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) selector represents an element that is capable of making sound, such as {{htmlelement("audio")}} or {{htmlelement("video")}}, but is muted (forced silent).

Muted is different from {{cssxref(":volume-locked")}} in that the page author has control over whether a media element can be muted or un-muted.
User agents may set media `muted` value according to use preferences (e.g., remembering the last set value across sessions, on a per-site basis, or otherwise).
An element that is `:volume-locked` cannot be muted, un-muted, or have its volume changed via JavaScript because of an operating system or user agent preference.

## Syntax

```css
:muted {
  /* ... */
}
```

## Examples

:muted {
  outline: 5px solid red;
