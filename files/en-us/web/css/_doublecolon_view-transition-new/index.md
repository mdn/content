{{CSSRef}}{{seecompattable}}

The **`::view-transition-new`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) represents the "new" view state of a view transition â€” a live representation of the new view, after the transition.

During a view transition, `::view-transition-new` is included in the associated pseudo-element tree as explained in [The view transition process](/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API#the_view_transition_process). It is only ever a child of a {{cssxref("::view-transition-image-pair")}}, and never has any children.

It is a replaced element, and therefore can be manipulated with properties such as {{cssxref("object-fit")}} and {{cssxref("object-position")}}. It has natural dimensions equal to the content's size.

The following default styling is included in the UA stylesheet:

```css
@keyframes -ua-view-transition-fade-in {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}

html::view-transition-new(*) {
  position: absolute;
  inset-block-start: 0;
  inline-size: 100%;
  block-size: auto;

  animation-name: -ua-view-transition-fade-in;
  animation-duration: inherit;
  animation-fill-mode: inherit;
}
```

> **Note:** Additional view transition style sheet styles are also setup to animate `::view-transition-new`. These are dynamically generated during the view transition; see the specification [setup transition pseudo-elements](https://w3c.github.io/csswg-drafts/css-view-transitions-1/#setup-transition-pseudo-elements) and [update pseudo-element styles](https://w3c.github.io/csswg-drafts/css-view-transitions-1/#update-pseudo-element-styles) sections for more details.

## Syntax

```css
::view-transition-new(<pt-name-selector >) {
  /* ... */
}
```

`<pt-name-selector>` can take one of the following values:

- `*`
  - : Causes the pseudo-element to match all view transition groups.
- {{cssxref("custom-ident")}}
  - : Causes the pseudo-element to match a specific view transition group created by assigning the given {{cssxref("custom-ident")}} to an element via the {{cssxref("view-transition-name")}} property.

## Examples

```css
figcaption {
  view-transition-name: figcaption;
  contain: layout;
}

@keyframes grow-x {
  from {
    transform: scaleX(0);
  }
  to {
    transform: scaleX(1);
  }
}

@keyframes shrink-x {
  from {
    transform: scaleX(1);
  }
  to {
    transform: scaleX(0);
  }
}

::view-transition-old(figcaption),
::view-transition-new(figcaption) {
  width: auto;
  height: auto;
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  right: 0;
  left: auto;
  transform-origin: right center;
}

::view-transition-old(figcaption) {
  animation: 0.25s linear both shrink-x;
}

::view-transition-new(figcaption) {
  animation: 0.25s 0.25s linear both grow-x;
}
```
