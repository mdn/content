{{CSSRef}}

The grid wrapper pattern is useful for aligning grid content within a central wrapper while also allowing items to break out and align to the edge of the containing element or page.

## Requirements

Items placed on the grid should be able to align to a horizontally-centered max-width wrapper or the outer edges of the grid, or both.

## Choices made

This recipe uses the CSS grid {{cssxref("minmax", "minmax()")}} function to define the grid track sizes in the {{cssxref("grid-template-columns")}} property. For the central columns with a maximum width, we can set a minimum value of `0` or greater and a maximum value that specifies the maximum size the column tracks will grow to. Using [relative](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#relative_length_units_based_on_font) or [absolute](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#absolute_length_units) {{cssxref("length")}} units (pixels, ems, rems) will create a fixed maximum size for the central wrapper, whereas using {{cssxref("percentage")}} values or [viewport units](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length#relative_length_units_based_on_viewport) will cause the wrapper to grow or shrink in response to its context.

The outer two columns have a maximum size of `1fr`, meaning that they will each expand to fill the remaining available space in the grid container.

## Useful fallbacks or alternative methods

To center the grid horizontally on the page you can set a `max-width` along with left and right `auto` {{cssxref("margin")}}s:

```css
.grid {
  max-width: 96vw; /* Limits the width to 96% of the width of the viewport */
  margin: 0 auto; /* horizontally centers the container */
}
```

## Accessibility concerns

Although CSS grid enables positioning items anywhere (within reason), ensuring that your underlying markup follows a logical order is important (see [CSS Grid layout and accessibility](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout/Grid_layout_and_accessibility) for more details).
