{{CSSRef}}

Breadcrumb navigation helps the user to understand their location in the website by providing a breadcrumb trail back to the start page.

![Links displayed inline with separators](breadcrumb-navigation.png)

## Requirements

The items typically display inline with a separator to indicate a hierarchy between individual pages.

> **Note:** The example above uses two selectors to insert content before every `li` except the first one. This could also be achieved using one selector only:
>
> ```css
> .breadcrumb li:not(:first-child)::before {
>   content: "→";
> }
> ```
>
> This solution uses a more complicated selector, but requires fewer rules. Feel free to choose the solution that you prefer.

## Choices made

This pattern is laid out using a simple flex layout demonstrating how a line of CSS can give us our navigation. The separators are added using CSS Generated Content. You could change these to any separator that you like.

## Accessibility concerns

I have used the [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) and [`aria-current`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-current) attributes to help users understand what this navigation is and where the current page is in the structure. See the related links for more information.

Beware that the arrows `→` added via `content` are also exposed to screen readers or braille displays.
