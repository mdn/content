Breadcrumb navigation helps the user to understand their location in the website by providing a breadcrumb trail back to the start page.

## Requirements

The items typically display inline with a separator to indicate a hierarchy between individual pages.

## Recipe

> [Download this example](https://github.com/mdn/css-examples/blob/master/css-cookbook/breadcrumb-navigation--download.html)

> **Note:** The example above uses two selectors to insert content before every `li` except the first one. This could also be achieved using one selector only:
>
>     .breadcrumb li:not(:first-child)::before {
>       content: "→";
>     }
>
> This solution uses a more complex selector, but requires less rules. Feel free to choose the solution that you prefer.

## Choices made

This pattern is laid out using a simple flex layout demonstrating how a line of CSS can give us our navigation. The separators are added using CSS Generated Content. You could change these to any separator that you like.

## Accessibility concerns

I have used the [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) and [`aria-current`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-current) attributes to help users understand what this navigation is and where the current page is in the structure. See the related links for more information.

## Browser compatibility

The various layout methods have different browser support. See the charts below for details on basic support for the properties used.

#### Flexbox

{{Compat("css.properties.flex")}}
