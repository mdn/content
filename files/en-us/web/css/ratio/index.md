{{CSSRef}}

The **`<ratio>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Types), used for describing [aspect ratios](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/aspect-ratio) in [media queries](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries), denotes the proportion between two unitless values.

## Syntax

In Media Queries Level 3, the `<ratio>` data type consisted of a strictly positive {{cssxref("&lt;integer&gt;")}} followed by a forward slash ('/', Unicode `U+002F SOLIDUS`) and a second strictly positive {{cssxref("&lt;integer&gt;")}}. Spaces before and after the slash are optional. The first number represents the width, while the second represents the height.

In Media Queries Level 4, the `<ratio>` date type is updated to consist of a strictly positive {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}} followed by a forward slash ('/', Unicode `U+002F SOLIDUS`) and a second strictly positive {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}}. In addition a single {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}} as a value is allowable.
