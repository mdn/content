{{CSSRef}}

The **`initial`** CSS keyword applies the [initial (or default) value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initial_value) of a property to an element. It can be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS shorthand property {{cssxref("all")}}. With `all` set to `initial`, all CSS properties can be restored to their respective initial values in one go instead of restoring each one separately.

On [inherited properties](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inheritance#inherited_properties), the initial value may be unexpected. You should consider using the {{cssxref("inherit")}}, {{cssxref("unset")}}, {{cssxref("revert")}}, or {{cssxref("revert-layer")}} keywords instead.

## Examples

### Using initial to reset color for an element

#### HTML

```html
<p>
  <span>This text is red.</span>
  <em>This text is in the initial color (typically black).</em>
  <span>This is red again.</span>
</p>
```

#### CSS

```css
p {
  color: red;
}

em {
  color: initial;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample('Using_initial_to_reset_color_for_an_element')}}

With the `initial` keyword in this example, `color` value on the `em` element is restored to the initial value of [`color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color#formal_definition), as defined in the specification.
