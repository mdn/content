{{CSSRef}}

The **`<integer>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Types) is a special type of {{cssxref("number")}} that represents a whole number, whether positive or negative. Integers can be used in numerous CSS properties, such as {{cssxref("column-count")}}, {{cssxref("counter-increment")}}, {{cssxref("grid-column")}}, {{cssxref("grid-row")}}, and {{cssxref("z-index")}}.

## Syntax

The `<integer>` data type consists of one or several decimal digits, 0 through 9 inclusive, optionally preceded by a single `+` or `-` sign. There is no unit associated with integers.

> **Note:** There is no official range of valid `<integer>` values and the specification do not specify a range.

## Interpolation

When animated, values of the `<integer>` data type are {{Glossary("interpolation", "interpolated")}} using discrete, whole steps. The calculation is done as if they were real, floating-point numbers; the discrete value is obtained using the [floor function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_function). The speed of the interpolation is determined by the [timing function](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function) associated with the animation.

## Examples
