{{CSSRef}}

The **`<time>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Types) represents a time value expressed in seconds or milliseconds. It is used in {{cssxref("animation")}}, {{cssxref("transition")}}, and related properties.

## Syntax

The `<time>` data type consists of a {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}} followed by one of the units listed below. Optionally, it may be preceded by a single `+` or `-` sign. As with all dimensions, there is no space between the unit literal and the number.

> **Note:** Although the number `0` is always the same regardless of unit, the unit may not be omitted. In other words, `0` is invalid and does not represent `0s` or `0ms`.

### Units

- **`s`**
  - : Represents a time in seconds. Examples: `0s`, `1.5s`, `-60s`.
- **`ms`**
  - : Represents a time in milliseconds. Examples: `0ms`, `150.25ms`, `-60000ms`.

> **Note:** Conversion between `s` and `ms` follows the logical `1s` = `1000ms`.

## Examples

### Valid times

    12s         Positive integer
    -456ms      Negative integer
    4.3ms       Non-integer
    14mS        The unit is case-insensitive, although capital letters are not recommended.
    +0s         Zero with a leading + and a unit
    -0ms        Zero with a leading - and a unit

### Invalid times

```plain example-bad
0           Although unitless zero is allowed for <length>s, it's invalid for <time>s.
12.0        This is a <number>, not a <time>, because it's missing a unit.
7 ms        No space is allowed between the number and the unit.
