{{CSSRef}}

The **`:nth-of-type()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-class](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) matches elements of a given type (tag name), based on their position among a group of siblings.

```css
/* Selects every fourth <p> element
   among any group of siblings */
p:nth-of-type(4n) {
  color: lime;
}
```

## Syntax

The `nth-of-type` pseudo-class is specified with a single argument, which represents the pattern for matching elements.

See {{Cssxref(":nth-child")}} for a more detailed explanation of its syntax.

### Formal syntax

{{csssyntax}}

## Examples

### Basic example

#### HTML

```html
<div>
  <div>This element isn't counted.</div>
  <p>1st paragraph.</p>
  <p class="fancy">2nd paragraph.</p>
  <div>This element isn't counted.</div>
  <p class="fancy">3rd paragraph.</p>
  <p>4th paragraph.</p>
</div>
```

#### CSS

```css
/* Odd paragraphs */
p:nth-of-type(2n+1) {
  color: red;
}

/* Even paragraphs */
p:nth-of-type(2n) {
  color: blue;
}

/* First paragraph */
p:nth-of-type(1) {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* This will match the 3rd paragraph as it will match elements which are 2n+1 AND have a class of fancy.
The second paragraph has a class of fancy but is not matched as it is not :nth-of-type(2n+1) */
p.fancy:nth-of-type(2n+1) {
  text-decoration: underline;
}
```

> **Note:** There is no way to select the nth-of-class using this selector. The selector looks at the type only when creating the list of matches. You can however apply CSS to an element based on `:nth-of-type` location **and** a class, as shown in the example above.
