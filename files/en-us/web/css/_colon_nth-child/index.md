{{CSSRef}}

The **`:nth-child()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-class](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) matches elements based on their position among a group of siblings.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/tabbed/pseudo-class-nth-child.html", "tabbed-shorter")}}

Note that, in the `element:nth-child()` syntax, the child count includes children of any element type; but it is considered a match only if the element _at that child position_ is of the specified element type.

## Syntax

`:nth-child()` takes a single argument that describes a pattern for matching element indices in a list of siblings. Element indices are 1-based.

```css-nolint
:nth-child(<nth> [of <complex-selector-list>]?) {
  /* ... */
}
```

### Keyword values

- `odd`
  - : Represents elements whose numeric position in a series of siblings is odd: 1, 3, 5, etc.
- `even`
  - : Represents elements whose numeric position in a series of siblings is even: 2, 4, 6, etc.

### Functional notation

- `<An+B>`

  - : Represents elements whose numeric position in a series of siblings matches the pattern `An+B`, for every positive integer or zero value of `n`, where:

    - `A` is an integer step size,
    - `B` is an integer offset,
    - `n` is all nonnegative integers, starting from 0.

    It can be read as the `An+B`-th element of a list. The `A` and `B` must both have {{cssxref("&lt;integer&gt;")}} values.

## Examples

### Example selectors

- `tr:nth-child(odd)` or `tr:nth-child(2n+1)`
  - : Represents the odd rows of an HTML table: 1, 3, 5, etc.
- `tr:nth-child(even)` or `tr:nth-child(2n)`
  - : Represents the even rows of an HTML table: 2, 4, 6, etc.
- `:nth-child(7)`
  - : Represents the seventh element.
- `:nth-child(5n)`
  - : Represents elements **5** \[=5×1], **10** \[=5×2], **15** \[=5×3], **etc.** The first one to be returned as a result of the formula is **0** \[=5x0], resulting in a no-match, since the elements are indexed from 1, whereas `n` starts from 0. This may seem weird at first, but it makes more sense when the `B` part of the formula is `>0`, like in the next example.
- `:nth-child(n+7)`
  - : Represents the seventh and all following elements: **7** \[=0+7], **8** \[=1+7], **9** \[=2+7], **etc.**
- `:nth-child(3n+4)`
  - : Represents elements **4** \[=(3×0)+4], **7** \[=(3×1)+4], **10** \[=(3×2)+4], **13** \[=(3×3)+4], **etc.**
- `:nth-child(-n+3)`
  - : Represents the first three elements. \[=-0+3, -1+3, -2+3]
- `p:nth-child(n)`
  - : Represents every `<p>` element in a group of siblings. This selects the same elements as a simple `p` selector (although with a higher specificity).
- `p:nth-child(1)` or `p:nth-child(0n+1)`
  - : Represents every `<p>` that is the first element in a group of siblings. This is the same as the {{cssxref(":first-child")}} selector (and has the same specificity).
- `p:nth-child(n+8):nth-child(-n+15)`
  - : Represents the eighth through the fifteenth `<p>` elements of a group of siblings.

### Detailed example

#### HTML

```html
<h3>
  <code>span:nth-child(2n+1)</code>, WITHOUT an <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> among
  the child elements.
</h3>
<p>Children 1, 3, 5, and 7 are selected.</p>
<div class="first">
  <span>Span 1!</span>
  <span>Span 2</span>
  <span>Span 3!</span>
  <span>Span 4</span>
  <span>Span 5!</span>
  <span>Span 6</span>
  <span>Span 7!</span>
</div>

<br />

<h3>
  <code>span:nth-child(2n+1)</code>, WITH an <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> among the
  child elements.
</h3>
<p>
  Children 1, 5, and 7 are selected.<br />
  3 is used in the counting because it is a child, but it isn't selected because
  it isn't a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>.
</p>
<div class="second">
  <span>Span!</span>
  <span>Span</span>
  <em>This is an `em`.</em>
  <span>Span</span>
  <span>Span!</span>
  <span>Span</span>
  <span>Span!</span>
  <span>Span</span>
</div>

<br />

<h3>
  <code>span:nth-of-type(2n+1)</code>, WITH an <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> among the
  child elements.
</h3>
<p>
  Children 1, 4, 6, and 8 are selected.<br />
  3 isn't used in the counting or selected because it is an
  <code>&lt;em&gt;</code>, not a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, and
  <code>nth-of-type</code> only selects children of that type. The
  <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> is completely skipped over and ignored.
</p>
<div class="third">
  <span>Span!</span>
  <span>Span</span>
  <em>This is an `em`.</em>
  <span>Span!</span>
  <span>Span</span>
  <span>Span!</span>
  <span>Span</span>
  <span>Span!</span>
</div>
```

#### CSS

```css
html {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

span,
div em {
  padding: 5px;
  border: 1px solid green;
  display: inline-block;
  margin-bottom: 3px;
}

.first span:nth-child(2n + 1),
.second span:nth-child(2n + 1),
.third span:nth-of-type(2n + 1) {
  background-color: lime;
}
```
