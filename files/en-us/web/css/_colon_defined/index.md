{{ CSSRef }}

The **`:defined`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-class](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) represents any element that has been defined. This includes any standard element built in to the browser, and custom elements that have been successfully defined (i.e. with the {{domxref("CustomElementRegistry.define()")}} method).

```css
/* Selects any defined element */
:defined {
  font-style: italic;
}

/* Selects any instance of a specific custom element */
simple-custom:defined {
  display: block;
}
```

## Examples

### Hiding elements until they are defined

The following snippets are taken from our [defined-pseudo-class](https://github.com/mdn/web-components-examples/tree/master/defined-pseudo-class) demo ([see it live also](https://mdn.github.io/web-components-examples/defined-pseudo-class/)).

In this demo we define a very simple trivial custom element:

```js
customElements.define('simple-custom',
  class extends HTMLElement {
    constructor() {
      super();

      let divElem = document.createElement('div');
      divElem.textContent = this.getAttribute('text');

      let shadowRoot = this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'})
        .appendChild(divElem);
  }
})
```

Then insert a copy of this element into the document, along with a standard `<p>`:

```html
<simple-custom text="Custom element example text"></simple-custom>

<p>Standard paragraph example text</p>
```

In the CSS we first include the following rules:

```css
// Give the two elements distinctive backgrounds
p {
  background: yellow;
}

simple-custom {
  background: cyan;
}

// Both the custom and the built-in element are given italic text
:defined {
  font-style: italic;
}
```

Then provide the following two rules to hide any instances of our custom element that are not defined, and display instances that are defined as block level elements:

```css
simple-custom:not(:defined) {
  display: none;
}

simple-custom:defined {
  display: block;
}
```

This is useful if you have a complex custom element that takes a while to load into the page — you might want to hide instances of the element until definition is complete, so that you don't end up with flashes of ugly unstyled elements on the page
