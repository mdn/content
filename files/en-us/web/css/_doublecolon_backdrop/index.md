{{CSSRef}}

The **`::backdrop`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) is a box the size of the {{Glossary("viewport")}} which is rendered immediately beneath any element being presented in fullscreen mode. This includes both elements which have been placed in fullscreen mode using the [Fullscreen API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API) and {{HTMLElement("dialog")}} elements.

When multiple elements have been placed into fullscreen mode, the backdrop is drawn immediately beneath the frontmost such element, and on top of the older fullscreen elements.

```css
/* Backdrop is only displayed when dialog is opened with dialog.showModal() */
dialog::backdrop {
  background: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.25);
}
```

All fullscreen elements are placed in a last-in/first out (LIFO) stack in the top layer, which is a special layer in the viewport which is always rendered last (and therefore on top) before drawing the viewport's contents to the screen. The `::backdrop` pseudo-element makes it possible to obscure, style, or completely hide everything located below the element when it's the topmost one in the top layer.

`::backdrop` neither inherits from nor is inherited by any other elements. No restrictions are made on what properties apply to this pseudo-element.

## Syntax

```css
::backdrop {
  /* ... */
}
```

## Examples

### Styling the backdrop for fullscreen video

In this example, the backdrop style used when a video is shifted to fullscreen mode is configured to be a grey-blue color rather than the black it defaults to in most browsers.

```css
video::backdrop {
  background-color: #448;
}
```

The resulting screen looks like this:

![An almost full-screen video player with purple above and below the player as the video player doesn't completely fill the screen.](bbb-backdrop.png)

[See this example in action](https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/backdrop/index.html), after changing the color of the background cause the video to go fullscreen to see the change to the backdrop color.
