<p>The <strong><code>::backdrop</code></strong> <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a> <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements">pseudo-element</a> is a box the size of the {{Glossary("viewport")}} which is rendered immediately beneath any element being presented in full-screen mode. </span>This includes both elements which have been placed in full-screen mode using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API">Fullscreen API</a> and {{HTMLElement("dialog")}} elements.</p>

<p>When multiple elements have been placed into full-screen mode, the backdrop is drawn immediately beneath the frontmost such element, and on top of the older full-screen elements.</p>

<pre class="brush: css no-line-numbers">/* Backdrop is only displayed when dialog is opened with dialog.showModal() */
dialog::backdrop {
  background: rgba(255,0,0,.25);
}</pre>

<p>All full-screen elements are placed in a last-in/first out (LIFO) stack in the top layer, which is a special layer in the viewport which is always rendered last (and therefore on top) before drawing the viewport's contents to the screen. The <code>::backdrop</code> pseudo-element makes it possible to obscure, style, or completely hide everything located below the element when it's the topmost one in the top layer.</p>

<p><code>::backdrop</code> neither inherits from nor is inherited by any other elements. No restrictions are made on what properties apply to this pseudo-element.</p>

<p>In this example, the backdrop style used when a video is shifted to full-screen mode is configured to be a grey-blue color rather than the black it defaults to in most browsers.</p>

<pre class="brush: css">video::backdrop {
  background-color: #448;
}
</pre>

<p>The resulting screen looks like this:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="bbb-backdrop.png"></p>

<p><a href="https://mdn.github.io/css-examples/backdrop/index.html">See this example in action</a>, after changing the color of the background cause the video to go fullscreen to see the change to the backdrop color.</p>
