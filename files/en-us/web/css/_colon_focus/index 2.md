{{CSSRef}}

The **`:focus`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-class](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) represents an element (such as a form input) that has received focus. It is generally triggered when the user clicks or taps on an element or selects it with the keyboard's <kbd>Tab</kbd> key.

```css
/* Selects any <input> when focused */
input:focus {
  color: red;
}
```

> **Note:** This pseudo-class applies only to the focused element itself. Use {{CSSxRef(":focus-within")}} if you want to select an element that _contains_ a focused element.

## Accessibility concerns

Make sure the visual focus indicator can be seen by people with low vision.  This will also benefit anyone use a screen in a brightly lit space (like outside in the sun). [WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html) requires that the visual focus indicator be at least 3 to 1.

### `:focus { outline: none; }`

Never just remove the focus outline (visible focus indicator) without replacing it with a focus outline that will pass [WCAG 2.1 SC 1.4.11 Non-Text Contrast](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/non-text-contrast.html).
