{{CSSRef}}

The **`touch-action`** CSS property sets how an element's region can be manipulated by a touchscreen user (for example, by zooming features built into the browser).

```css
/* Keyword values */
touch-action: auto;
touch-action: none;
touch-action: pan-x;
touch-action: pan-left;
touch-action: pan-right;
touch-action: pan-y;
touch-action: pan-up;
touch-action: pan-down;
touch-action: pinch-zoom;
touch-action: manipulation;

/* Global values */
touch-action: inherit;
touch-action: initial;
touch-action: revert;
touch-action: unset;
```

By default, panning (scrolling) and pinching gestures are handled exclusively by the browser. An application using {{domxref("Pointer_events", "Pointer events", "", 1)}} will receive a {{domxref("HTMLElement/pointercancel_event", "pointercancel")}} event when the browser starts handling a touch gesture. By explicitly specifying which gestures should be handled by the browser, an application can supply its own behavior in {{domxref("HTMLElement/pointermove_event", "pointermove")}} and {{domxref("HTMLElement/pointerup_event", "pointerup")}} listeners for the remaining gestures. Applications using {{domxref("Touch_events", "Touch events", "", 1)}} disable the browser handling of gestures by calling {{domxref("Event.preventDefault","preventDefault()")}}, but should also use `touch-action` to ensure the browser knows the intent of the application before any event listeners have been invoked.

When a gesture is started, the browser intersects the `touch-action` values of the touched element and its ancestors, up to the one that implements the gesture (in other words, the first containing scrolling element). This means that in practice, `touch-action` is typically applied only to top-level elements which have some custom behavior, without needing to specify `touch-action` explicitly on any of that element's descendants.

> **Note:** After a gesture starts, changes to `touch-action` will not have any impact on the behavior of the current gesture.

## Syntax

The `touch-action` property may be specified as either:

- One of the keywords `auto`, `none`, [`manipulation`](#manipulation), _or_
- One of the keywords `pan-x`, `pan-left`, `pan-right`, and/or one of the keywords `pan-y`, `pan-up`, `pan-down`, plus optionally the keyword `pinch-zoom`.

### Values

- `auto`
  - : Enable browser handling of all panning and zooming gestures.
- `none`
  - : Disable browser handling of all panning and zooming gestures.
- `pan-x`
  - : Enable single-finger horizontal panning gestures. May be combined with **pan-y**, **pan-up**, **pan-down** and/or **pinch-zoom**.
- `pan-y`
  - : Enable single-finger vertical panning gestures. May be combined with **pan-x**, **pan-left**, **pan-right** and/or **pinch-zoom**.
- `manipulation`
  - : Enable panning and pinch zoom gestures, but disable additional non-standard gestures such as double-tap to zoom. Disabling double-tap to zoom removes the need for browsers to delay the generation of **click** events when the user taps the screen. This is an alias for "**pan-x pan-y pinch-zoom**" (which, for compatibility, is itself still valid).
- `pan-left`, `pan-right`, `pan-up`, `pan-down` {{experimental_inline}}
  - : Enable single-finger gestures that begin by scrolling in the given direction(s). Once scrolling has started, the direction may still be reversed. Note that scrolling "up" (**pan-up**) means that the user is dragging their finger downward on the screen surface, and likewise **pan-left** means the user is dragging their finger to the right. Multiple directions may be combined except when there is a simpler representation (for example, **"pan-left pan-right**" is invalid since "**pan-x**" is simpler, but "**pan-left pan-down**" is valid).
- `pinch-zoom`
  - : Enable multi-finger panning and zooming of the page. This may be combined with any of the **pan-** values.

## Accessibility concerns

A declaration of `touch-action: none;` may inhibit operating a browser's zooming capabilities. This will prevent people experiencing low vision conditions from being able to read and understand page content.

## Examples

### Disabling all gestures

The most common usage is to disable all gestures on an element (and its non-scrollable descendants) that provides its own dragging and zooming behavior â€“ such as a map or game surface.

#### HTML

```html
<div id="map"></div>
```

#### CSS

```css
#map {
  height: 150vh;
  width: 70vw;
  background: linear-gradient(blue, green);
  touch-action: none;
}
```
