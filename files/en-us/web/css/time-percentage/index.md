{{CSSRef}}

The **`<time-percentage>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Types) represents a value that can be either a {{Cssxref("time")}} or a {{Cssxref("percentage")}}.

## Syntax

Refer to the documentation for {{Cssxref("time")}} and {{Cssxref("percentage")}} for details of the individual syntaxes allowed by this type.

## Examples

### Use in calc()

Where a `<time-percentage>` is specified as an allowable type, this means that the percentage resolves to a time and therefore can be used in a {{Cssxref("calc()")}} expression.

### Valid percentages

    50%
    +50%        Optional plus sign
    -50%        Negative percentages are not valid for all properties that accept percentages

### Invalid percentages

```plain example-bad
50 %        Space not allowed between the space and the percentage sign
```

### Valid times

    12s         Positive integer
    -456ms      Negative integer
    4.3ms       Non-integer
    14mS        The unit is case-insensitive, although capital letters are not recommended.
    +0s         Zero with a leading + and a unit
    -0ms        Zero with a leading - and a unit

### Invalid times

```plain example-bad
0           Although unitless zero is allowed for <length>s, it's invalid for <time>s.
12.0        This is a <number>, not a <time>, because it's missing a unit.
7 ms        No space is allowed between the number and the unit.
