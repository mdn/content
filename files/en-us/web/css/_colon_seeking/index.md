{{CSSRef}}

The **`:seeking`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-class](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) selector represents an element that is playable, such as {{htmlelement("audio")}} or {{htmlelement("video")}}, when the playable element is seeking a playback position in the media resource.
A resource is considered to be seeking if the user has requested playback of a specific position in the media resource, but the media element has not yet reached that position.

Seeking is different from {{cssxref(":buffering")}} in that the media element is not currently loading data, but is instead skipping to a new position in the media resource.
For more information, see the [Media buffering, seeking, and time ranges](/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Audio_and_video_delivery/buffering_seeking_time_ranges#seekable) guide.
