{{CSSRef}}

The **`inherit`** CSS keyword causes the element to take the [computed value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/computed_value) of the property from its parent element. It can be applied to any CSS property, including the CSS shorthand property {{cssxref("all")}}.

For [inherited properties](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inheritance#inherited_properties), this reinforces the default behavior, and is only needed to override another rule.

> **Note:** Inheritance is always from the parent element in the document tree, even when the parent element is not the containing block.

## Examples

### Exclude selected elements from a rule

```css
/* Make second-level headers green */
h2 {
  color: green;
}

/* Leave those in the sidebar alone so they use their parent's color */
#sidebar h2 {
  color: inherit;
}
```

In this example, the `h2` elements inside the sidebar might be different colors. For example, consider one of them that would by the child of a `div` matched by the rule:

```css
div#current {
  color: blue;
}
```

Then, it would be blue.
