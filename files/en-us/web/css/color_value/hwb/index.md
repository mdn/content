{{CSSRef}}

The **`hwb()`** functional notation expresses a given color according to its hue, whiteness, and blackness. An optional alpha component represents the color's transparency.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/css/function-hwb.html")}}

## Syntax

```css
hwb(194 0% 0%) /* #00c3ff */
hwb(194 0% 0% / .5) /* #00c3ff with 50% opacity */
```

### Values

> **Note:** The HWB function does **not** use commas to separate its values as with previous color functions and the optional alpha value needs to be preceded with a forward slash (`/`) if specified.

- Functional notation: `hwb(H W B[ / A])`

  - : `H` (hue) is an {{cssxref("&lt;angle&gt;")}} of the color circle given in `deg`s, `rad`s, `grad`s, or `turn`s in the [CSS Color](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color/#typedef-hue) specification. When written as a unitless {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}}, it is interpreted as degrees, as specified in the [CSS Color Level 3](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-color-3/#hsl-color) specification. By definition, red=0deg=360deg, with the other colors spread around the circle, so green=120deg, blue=240deg, etc. As an `<angle>`, it implicitly wraps around such that -120deg=240deg, 480deg=120deg, -1turn=1turn, etc.

    `W` (whiteness) specifies the amount of white to mix in, as a percentage from 0% (no whiteness) to 100% (full whiteness).

    `B` (blackness) specifies the amount of black to mix in, also from 0% (no blackness) to 100% (full blackness).

    `A` (alpha) can be a {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}} between `0` and `1`, or a {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}, where the number `1` corresponds to `100%` (full opacity).
