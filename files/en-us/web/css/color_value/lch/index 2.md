{{CSSRef}}

The **`lch()`** functional notation expresses a given color in the LCH color space. It has the same L axis as {{cssxref("color_value/lab()","lab()")}}, but uses polar coordinates C (Chroma) and H (Hue).

## Syntax

```css
lch(29.2345% 44.2 27);
lch(52.2345% 72.2 56.2);
lch(52.2345% 72.2 56.2 / .5);
```

### Values

- Functional notation: `lch(L C H [/ A])`

  - : `L` specifies the CIE Lightness, and is a {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}} between `0%` representing black and `100%` representing white.

    The second argument `C` is the chroma (roughly representing the "amount of color"). Its minimum useful value is 0, while its maximum is theoretically unbounded (but in practice does not exceed 230).

    The third argument `H` is the hue angle. `0deg` points along the positive "a" axis (toward purplish red), `90deg` points along the positive "b" axis (toward mustard yellow), `180deg` points along the negative "a" axis (toward greenish cyan), and `270deg` points along the negative "b" axis (toward sky blue).

    `A` (alpha) can be a {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}} between `0` and `1`, or a {{cssxref("&lt;percentage&gt;")}}, where the number `1` corresponds to `100%` (full opacity).
