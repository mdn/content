In CSS, **inheritance** controls what happens when no value is specified for a property on an element.

CSS properties can be categorized in two types:

- **inherited properties**, which by default are set to the [computed value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/computed_value) of the parent element
- **non-inherited properties**, which by default are set to [initial value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initial_value) of the property

Refer to [any CSS property](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference#index) definition to see whether a specific property inherits by default ("Inherited: yes") or not ("Inherited: no").

## Inherited properties

When no value for an **inherited property** has been specified on an element, the element gets the [computed value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/computed_value) of that property on its parent element. Only the root element of the document gets the [initial value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initial_value) given in the property's summary.

A typical example of an inherited property is the [`color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color) property. Consider the following style rules and the markup:

```css
p {
  color: green;
}
```

```html
<p>This paragraph has <em>emphasized text</em> in it.</p>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("","",40)}}

The words "emphasized text" will appear green, since the `em` element has inherited the value of the [`color`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color) property from the `p` element. It does _not_ get the initial value of the property (which is the color that is used for the root element when the page specifies no color).

## Non-inherited properties

When no value for a **non-inherited property** has been specified on an element, the element gets the [initial value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initial_value) of that property (as specified in the property's summary).

A typical example of a non-inherited property is the {{ Cssxref("border") }} property. Consider the following style rules and the markup:

```css
p {
  border: medium solid;
}
```

```html
<p>This paragraph has <em>emphasized text</em> in it.</p>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("","",40)}}

The words "emphasized text" will not have another border (since the initial value of [`border-style`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-style) is `none`).

## Notes

The [`inherit`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inherit) keyword allows authors to explicitly specify inheritance. It works on both inherited and non-inherited properties.

You can control inheritance for all properties at once using the [`all`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/all) shorthand property, which applies its value to all properties. For example:

```css
p {
  all: revert;
  font-size: 200%;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

This reverts the style of the paragraphs' [`font`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font) property to the user agent's default unless a user stylesheet exists, in which case that is used instead. Then it doubles the font size and applies a [`font-weight`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight) of `"bold"`.

### Overriding inheritance, an example

Using our previous example with [`border`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border), if we explicitly set the inheritance with `inherit`, we get the following:

```css
p {
  border: medium solid;
}

em {
  border: inherit;
}
```

```html
<p>This paragraph has <em>emphasized text</em> in it.</p>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("","",40)}}

We can see here another border around the word "emphasized text".
