{{CSSRef}}

The **`@scope`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [at-rule](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/At-rule) enables you to select elements in specific DOM subtrees, targeting elements precisely without writing overly-specific selectors that are hard to override, and without coupling your selectors too tightly to the DOM structure.

In JavaScript, `@scope` can be accessed via the CSS object model interface {{DOMxRef("CSSScopeRule")}}.

## Syntax

The `@scope` at-rule contains one or more rulesets (termed **scoped style rules**) and defines a scope in which to apply them to selected elements. `@scope` can be used in two ways:

1. As a standalone block inside your CSS, in which case it includes a prelude section that includes **scope root** and optional **scope limit** selectors — these define the upper and lower bounds of the scope.

   ```css
   @scope (scope root) to (scope limit) {
     rulesets
   }
   ```

2. As inline styles included inside a {{htmlelement("style")}} element in your HTML, in which case the prelude is omitted, and the enclosed ruleset is automatically scoped to the `<style>` element's enclosing parent element.

   ```html
   <parent-element>
     <style>
       @scope {
         rulesets
       }
     </style>
   </parent-element>
   ```

## Description

A complex web document might include components such as headers, footers, news articles, maps, media players, ads, and others. As complexity increases, effectively managing the styling for these components becomes more of a concern, and effective scoping of styles helps us manage this complexity. Let's consider the following DOM tree:

```plain-nolint
body
└─ article.feature
   ├─ section.article-hero
   │  ├─ h2
   │  └─ img
   │
   ├─ section.article-body
   │  ├─ h3
   │  ├─ p
   │  ├─ img
   │  ├─ p
   │  └─ figure
   │     ├─ img
   │     └─ figcaption
   │
   └─ footer
      ├─ p
      └─ img
```

If you wanted to select the {{htmlelement("img")}} element inside the {{htmlelement("section")}} with a class of `article-body`, you could do the following:

- Write a selector like `.feature > .article-body > img`. However, that has high specificity so is hard to override, and is also tightly coupled to the DOM structure. If your markup structure changes in the future, you might need to rewrite your CSS.
- Write something less specific like `.article-body img`. However, that will select all images inside the `section`.

This is where `@scope` is useful. It allows you to define a precise scope inside which your selectors are allowed to target elements. For example, you could solve the above problem using a standalone `@scope` block like the following:

```css
@scope (.article-body) to (figure) {
  img {
    border: 5px solid black;
    background-color: goldenrod;
  }
}
```

The `.article-body` scope root selector defines the upper bound of the DOM tree scope in which the ruleset will be applied, and the `figure` scope limit selector defines the lower bound. As a result, only {{htmlelement("img")}} elements inside a `<section>` with a class of `article-body`, but not inside {{htmlelement("figure")}} elements, will be selected.

> **Note:** This kind of scoping — with an upper and lower bound — is commonly referred to as a **donut scope**.

If you want to select all images inside a `<section>` with a class of `article-body`, you can omit the scope limit:

```css
@scope (.article-body) {
  img {
    border: 5px solid black;
    background-color: goldenrod;
  }
}
```

Or you could include your `@scope` block inline inside a `<style>` element, which in turn is inside the `<section>` with a class of `article-body`:

```html
<section class="article-body">
  <style>
    @scope {
      img {
        border: 5px solid black;
        background-color: goldenrod;
      }
    }
  </style>

  <!-- ... -->
</section>
```

> **Note:** It is important to understand that, while `@scope` allows you to isolate the application of selectors to specific DOM subtrees, it does not completely isolate the applied styles to within those subtrees. This is most noticeable with inheritance — properties that are inherited by children (for example {{cssxref("color")}} or {{cssxref("font-family")}}) will still be inherited, beyond any set scope limit.

### The `:scope` pseudo-class

In the context of a `@scope` block, the {{cssxref(":scope")}} pseudo-class represents the scope root — it provides an easy way to apply styles to the scope root itself, from inside the scope:

```css
@scope (.feature) {
  :scope {
    background: rebeccapurple;
    color: antiquewhite;
    font-family: sans-serif;
  }
}
```

In fact, `:scope` is implicitly prepended to all scoped style rules. If you want, you can explicitly prepend `:scope` or prepend the [nesting](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_nesting) selector (`&`) to get the same effect if you find these representations easier to understand.

The three rules in the following block are all equivalent in what they select:

```css
@scope (.feature) {
  img { ... }

  :scope img { ... }

  & img { ... }
}
```

### Notes on scoped selector usage

- A scope limit can use `:scope` to specify a specific relationship requirement between the scope limit and root. For example:

  ```css
  /* figure is only a limit when it is a direct child of the :scope */
  @scope (.article-body) to (:scope > figure) { ... }
  ```

- A scope limit can reference elements outside the scope root using `:scope`. For example:

  ```css
  /* figure is only a limit when the :scope is inside .feature */
  @scope (.article-body) to (.feature :scope figure) { ... }
  ```

- Scoped style rules can't escape the subtree. Selections like `:scope + p` are invalid because that selection would be outside the subtree.

- It is perfectly valid to define the scope root and limit as a selector list, in which case multiple scopes will be defined. In the following example the styles are applied to any `<img>` inside a `<section>` with a class of `article-hero` or `article-body`, but not if it is nested inside a `<figure>`:

  ```css
  @scope (.article-hero, .article-body) to (figure) {
    img {
      border: 5px solid black;
      background-color: goldenrod;
    }
  }
  ```

### Specificity in `@scope`

Including a ruleset inside a `@scope` block does not affect the specificity of its selector, regardless of the selectors used inside the scope root and limit. For example:

```css
@scope (.article-body) {
  /* img has a specificity of 0-0-1, as expected */
  img { ... }
}
```

However, if you decide to explicitly prepend the `:scope` pseudo-class to your scoped selectors, you'll need to factor it in when calculating their specificity. `:scope`, like all regular pseudo-classes, has a specificity of 0-1-0. For example:

```css
@scope (.article-body) {
  /* :scope img has a specificity of 0-1-0 + 0-0-1 = 0-1-1 */
  :scope img { ... }
}
```

When using the `&` selector inside a `@scope` block, `&` represents the scope root selector; it is internally calculated as that selector wrapped inside an {{cssxref(":is", ":is()")}} pseudo-class function. So for example, in:

```css
@scope (figure, #primary) {
  & img { ... }
}
```

`& img` is equivalent to `:is(figure, #primary) img`. Since `:is()` takes the specificity of its most specific argument (`#primary`, in this case), the specificity of the scoped `& img` selector is therefore 1-0-0 + 0-0-1 = 1-0-1.

### The difference between `:scope` and `&` inside `@scope`

`:scope` represents the matched scope root, whereas `&` represents the selector used to match the scope root. Because of this, it is possible to chain `&` multiple times. However, you can only use `:scope` once — you can't match a scope root inside a scope root.

```css
@scope (.feature) {
  /* Selects a .feature inside the matched root .feature */
  & & { ... }

  /* Doesn't work */
  :scope :scope { ... }
}
```

### How `@scope` conflicts are resolved

`@scope` adds a new criterion to the [CSS cascade](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_cascade): **scoping proximity**. This states that when two scopes have conflicting styles, the style that has the smallest number of hops up the DOM tree hierarchy to the scope root is applied. Let's look at an example to see what this means.

Take the following HTML snippet, where different-themed cards are nested inside one another:

```html
<div class="light-theme">
  <p>Light theme text</p>
  <div class="dark-theme">
    <p>Dark theme text</p>
    <div class="light-theme">
      <p>Light theme text</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

If you wrote the theme CSS like so, you'd run into trouble:

```css
.light-theme {
  background: #ccc;
}

.dark-theme {
  background: #333;
}

.light-theme p {
  color: black;
}

.dark-theme p {
  color: white;
}
```

The innermost paragraph is supposed to be colored black because it is inside a light theme card. However, it's targeted by both `.light-theme p` and `.dark-theme p`. Because the `.dark-theme p` rule appears later in the source order, it is applied, and the paragraph ends up being wrongly colored white.

To fix this, you can use `@scope` as follows:

```css
@scope (.light-theme) {
  :scope {
    background: #ccc;
  }
  p {
    color: black;
  }
}

@scope (.dark-theme) {
  :scope {
    background: #333;
  }
  p {
    color: white;
  }
}
```

Now the innermost paragraph is correctly colored black. This is because it is only one DOM tree hierarchy level away from the `.light-theme` scope root, but two levels away from the `.dark-theme` scope root. Therefore, the light style wins.

> **Note:** Scoping proximity overrules source order but is itself overridden by other, higher-priority criteria such as [importance](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/important), [layers](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_layers), and [specificity](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity).

## Examples

### Basic style inside scope roots

In this example, we use two separate `@scope` blocks to match links inside elements with a `.light-scheme` and `.dark-scheme` class respectively. Note how `:scope` is used to select and provide styling to the scope roots themselves. In this example, the scope roots are the {{htmlelement("div")}} elements that have the classes applied to them.

#### HTML

```html
<div class="light-scheme">
  <p>
    MDN contains lots of information about
    <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a>,
    <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a>, and
    <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="dark-scheme">
  <p>
    MDN contains lots of information about
    <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a>,
    <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a>, and
    <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a>.
  </p>
</div>
```

#### CSS

```css hidden
div {
  padding: 10px;
}
```

```css
@scope (.light-scheme) {
  :scope {
    background-color: plum;
  }

  a {
    color: darkmagenta;
  }
}

@scope (.dark-scheme) {
  :scope {
    background-color: darkmagenta;
    color: antiquewhite;
  }

  a {
    color: plum;
  }
}
```

#### Result

The above code renders like this:

{{ EmbedLiveSample("Basic style inside scope roots", "100%", "150") }}

### Scope roots and scope limits

In this example, we have an HTML snippet that matches the DOM structure we talked about earlier in the [Description](#description) section. This structure represents a typical article summary. The key features to note are the {{htmlelement("img")}} elements, which are nested at various levels in the structure.

The aim of this example is to show how to use a scope root and limit to style `<img>` elements starting at the top of the hierarchy, but only down as far as (and not including) the `<img>` inside the {{htmlelement("figure")}} element — in effect creating a donut scope.

#### HTML

```html
<article class="feature">
  <section class="article-hero">
    <h2>Article heading</h2>
    <img alt="image" />
  </section>

  <section class="article-body">
    <h3>Article subheading</h3>
    <p>
      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nam euismod
      consectetur leo, nec eleifend quam volutpat vitae. Duis quis felis at
      augue imperdiet aliquam. Morbi at felis et massa mattis lacinia. Cras
      pharetra velit nisi, ac efficitur magna luctus nec.
    </p>

    <img alt="image" />

    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.</p>

    <figure>
      <img alt="image" />
      <figcaption>My infographic</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </section>

  <footer>
    <p>Written by Chris Mills.</p>
    <img alt="image" />
  </footer>
</article>
```

#### CSS

```css hidden
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

article {
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 2px solid gray;
}

.article-hero,
.article-body,
article footer {
  padding: 20px;
  margin: 10px;
  border: 2px solid lightgray;
}

img {
  height: 100px;
  width: 100%;
  display: block;
  background-color: lightgray;
  color: black;
  padding: 10px;
}
```

In our CSS, we have two `@scope` blocks:

- The first `@scope` block defines its scope root as elements with a class of `.feature` (in this case, the outer `<div>` only), demonstrating how `@scope` can be used to theme a specific HTML subset.
- The second `@scope` block also defines its scope root as elements with a class of `.feature`, but in addition defines a scope limit of `figure`. This ensures that contained rulesets will only be applied to matching elements within the scope root (`<div class="figure"> ... </div>` in this case) that **are not** nested inside descendant `<figure>` elements. This `@scope` block contains a single ruleset that styles `<img>` elements with a thick black border and a golden background color.

```css
/* Scoped CSS */

@scope (.feature) {
  :scope {
    background: rebeccapurple;
    color: antiquewhite;
    font-family: sans-serif;
  }

  figure {
    background-color: white;
    border: 2px solid black;
    color: black;
    padding: 10px;
  }
}

/* Donut scope */

@scope (.feature) to (figure) {
  img {
    border: 5px solid black;
    background-color: goldenrod;
  }
}
```

#### Result

In the rendered code, note how all of the `<img>` elements are styled with the thick border and golden background, except for the one inside the `<figure>` element (labeled "My infographic").
