{{CSSRef}}

The **`:active`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-class](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) represents an element (such as a button) that is being activated by the user. When using a mouse, "activation" typically starts when the user presses down the primary mouse button.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/tabbed/pseudo-class-active.html", "tabbed-shorter")}}

The `:active` pseudo-class is commonly used on {{HTMLElement("a")}} and {{HTMLElement("button")}} elements. Other common targets of this pseudo-class include elements that are _contained in_ an activated element, and form elements that are being activated through their associated {{HTMLElement("label")}}.

Styles defined by the `:active` pseudo-class will be overridden by any subsequent link-related pseudo-class ({{cssxref(":link")}}, {{cssxref(":hover")}}, or {{cssxref(":visited")}}) that has at least equal specificity. To style links appropriately, put the `:active` rule after all other link-related rules, as defined by the _LVHA-order_: `:link` — `:visited` — `:hover` — `:active`.

> **Note:** On systems with multi-button mice, CSS specifies that the `:active` pseudo-class must only apply to the primary button; on right-handed mice, this is typically the leftmost button.

## Syntax

```css
:active {
  /* ... */
}
```
