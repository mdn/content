{{CSSRef}}

The **`:nth-last-of-type()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-class](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) matches elements of a given type, based on their position among a group of siblings, counting from the end.

```css
/* Selects every fourth <p> element
   among any group of siblings,
   counting backwards from the last one */
p:nth-last-of-type(4n) {
  color: lime;
}
```

> **Note:** This pseudo-class is essentially the same as {{Cssxref(":nth-of-type")}}, except it counts items backwards from the _end_, not forwards from the beginning.

## Syntax

The `nth-last-of-type` pseudo-class is specified with a single argument, which represents the pattern for matching elements, counting from the end.

See {{Cssxref(":nth-last-child")}} for a more detailed explanation of its syntax.
