{{CSSRef}}

A CSS **pseudo-element** is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s).

## Syntax

```css
selector::pseudo-element {
  property: value;
}
```

For example, {{CSSxRef("::first-line")}} can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.

```css
/* The first line of every <p> element. */
p::first-line {
  color: blue;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
```

Double colons (`::`) are used for pseudo-elements. This distinguishes pseudo-elements from [pseudo-classes](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) that use single colon (`:`) in their notation.

You can use only one pseudo-element in a selector. The pseudo-element must appear after all the other components in the [complex](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors/Selector_structure#complex_selector) or [compound](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors/Selector_structure#compound_selector) selector in which it appears. For example, you can select a paragraph's first line using `p::first-line` but not the first-line's children or a hovered first line. So both `p::first-line > *` and `p::first-line:hover` are invalid.

While it is not possible to select an element based on its _state_ by using pseudo-elements, a pseudo-element can be used to select and style a part of an element that already has a state applied to it. For example, `p:hover::first-line` selects the first line (pseudo-element) of a paragraph when the paragraph itself is being hovered (pseudo-class).

> **Note:** When a [selector list](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors/Selector_structure#selector_list) contains an invalid selector, the entire style block is ignored.
