{{CSSRef}}

A CSS **pseudo-element** is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s).

## Syntax

```css
selector::pseudo-element {
  property: value;
}
```

For example, {{CSSxRef("::first-line")}} can be used to change the font of the first line of a paragraph.

```css
/* The first line of every <p> element. */
p::first-line {
  color: blue;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
```

Double colons (`::`) are used for pseudo-elements. This distinguishes pseudo-elements from [pseudo-classes](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) that use a single colon (`:`) in their notation.

Pseudo-elements do not exist independently. The element of which a pseudo-element is a part is called its _originating element_. A pseudo-element must appear after all the other components in the [complex](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors/Selector_structure#complex_selector) or [compound](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors/Selector_structure#compound_selector) selector. The last element in the selector is the originating element of the pseudo-element. For example, you can select a paragraph's first line using `p::first-line` but not the first-line's children. So `p::first-line > *` is invalid.

A pseudo-element can be selected based on the current state of the originating element. For example, `p:hover::first-line` selects the first line (pseudo-element) of a paragraph when the paragraph itself is being hovered (pseudo-class).

> [!NOTE]
> When a [selector list](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_selectors/Selector_structure#selector_list) contains an invalid selector, the entire style block is ignored.
