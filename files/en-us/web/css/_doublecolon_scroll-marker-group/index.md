{{CSSRef}}

The **`::scroll-marker-group`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) is a container generated inside a {{glossary("scroll container")}}, which contains any {{cssxref("::scroll-marker")}} pseudo-elements generated on the descendants of the scroll container.

## Syntax

```css-nolint
::scroll-marker-group {
  /* ... */
}
```

## Description

A scroll container's **`::scroll-marker-group`** pseudo-element represents a **scroll marker group**. This is a container that automatically has any {{cssxref("::scroll-marker")}} pseudo-elements generated on its descendants placed into it. This allows them to be positioned and laid out as a group, and is typically used when creating a CSS carousel, to provide a scroll position indicator. The individual scroll markers can also be used to navigate to their associated content items.

The {{cssxref("scroll-marker-group")}} property must be set to a non-`none` value on the scroll container for a `::scroll-marker-group` pseudo-element to be generated; the chosen value determines where the scroll marker group appears in the carousel's tab order and layout box order (but not DOM structure) â€” `before` puts it at the start, while `after` puts it at the end.

It is a best practice to match the visual rendering position of the scroll marker group with the tab order. When placing the group at the start of the content, put it at the beginning of the tab order using `before`. When placing the group at the end of the content, put it at the end of the tab order using `after`.

Accessibility-wise, the scroll marker group and contained scroll markers are rendered with [`tablist`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tablist_role)/[`tab`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/tab_role) semantics. When you <kbd>Tab</kbd> to the group, it behaves like a single item (that is, another press of the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key will move past the group to the next item), and you can move between the different scroll markers using the left and right (or up and down) cursor keys.

## Examples

### Creating carousel scroll markers

This demo is a carousel of single pages, with each item taking up the full page. We have included scroll markers to enable the user to move to the next and previous pages.

[Flexbox](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout) is used for the general layout of the carousel, [CSS scroll snap](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll_snap) is used to enforce clear pagination, and [CSS anchor positioning](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning) is used to position the scroll markers relative to the carousel.

#### HTML

The HTML consists of a [heading element](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) and an [unordered list](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul), with each [list item](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li) containing some sample content:

```html live-sample___carousel-example
<h1>CSS carousel single item per page</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h2>Page 1</h2>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Page 2</h2>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Page 3</h2>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h2>Page 4</h2>
  </li>
</ul>
```

#### CSS

```css hidden live-sample___carousel-example
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

body {
  margin: 0;
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  text-align: center;
  font-size: 1.7rem;
}

ul {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 300px;
  padding: 20px;
  display: flex;
  gap: 4vw;
}

li {
  list-style-type: none;
  background-color: #eee;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  padding: 20px;

  flex: 0 0 100%;
}

li:nth-child(even) {
  background-color: cyan;
}

ul {
  overflow-x: scroll;
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
}

li {
  scroll-snap-align: center;
}
```

To begin with, the list's {{cssxref("scroll-marker-group")}} property is set to `after`, so the `::scroll-marker-group` pseudo-element is placed after the list's DOM content in the focus and layout box order; this means it comes after the scroll buttons:

```css live-sample___carousel-example
ul {
  scroll-marker-group: after;
}
```

Next, the list's `::scroll-marker-group` pseudo-element is positioned relative to the carousel using CSS anchor positioning; it is horizontally centered on the carousel using a {{cssxref("justify-self")}} value of `anchor-center`. The group is laid out using flexbox, with a {{cssxref("justify-content")}} value of of `center` and a {{cssxref("gap")}} of `20px` so that its children (the {{cssxref("::scroll-marker")}} pseudo-elements) are centered inside the `::scroll-marker-group` with a gap between each one.

```css live-sample___carousel-example
ul::scroll-marker-group {
  position: absolute;
  position-anchor: --myCarousel;
  top: calc(anchor(bottom) - 70px);
  justify-self: anchor-center;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

Next, the scroll markers themselves are styled. The look of each one is handled by setting {{cssxref("width")}}, {{cssxref("height")}}, {{cssxref("background-color")}}, {{cssxref("border")}}, and {{cssxref("border-radius")}}, but we also need to set a non-`none` value for the `content` property so they are actually generated.

```css live-sample___carousel-example
li::scroll-marker {
  width: 16px;
  height: 16px;
  background-color: transparent;
  border: 2px solid black;
  border-radius: 50%;
  content: "";
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Generated content is inline by default; we can apply `width` and `height` to our scroll markers because they are being laid out as flex items.

Finally, the {{cssxref(":target-current")}} pseudo-class is used to select whichever scroll marker corresponds to the currently visible "page", highlighting how far the user has scrolled through the content. In this case, we set the `background-color` to `black` so it is styled as a filled-in circle.

```css live-sample___carousel-example
li::scroll-marker:target-current {
  background-color: black;
}
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("carousel-example", "100%", "420px")}}
