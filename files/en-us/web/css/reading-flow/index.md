{{CSSRef}}

The **`reading-flow`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property modifies the {{glossary("reading order")}} of elements within a [block](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Block/CSS), [flex](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout), or [grid](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) container when set to a value other than `normal`. Such a container is referred to as a [reading flow container](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Reading_order#reading_flow_container).

The resulting [reading flow](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Reading_order#reading_flow) can be further modified by setting {{cssxref("reading-order")}} values other than `0` on the container's children.

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
reading-flow: normal;
reading-flow: flex-visual;
reading-flow: flex-flow;
reading-flow: grid-rows;
reading-flow: grid-columns;
reading-flow: grid-order;

/* Global values */
reading-flow: inherit;
reading-flow: initial;
reading-flow: revert;
reading-flow: revert-layer;
reading-flow: unset;
```

### Value

The `reading-flow` property takes one of the following keywords as its value:

- `normal`

  - : The reading order follows the order of elements in the DOM. This is the default value if `reading-flow` is not explicitly set.

- `flex-visual`

  - : The reading order follows the visual reading order of `flex` items, taking the {{cssxref("writing-mode")}} into account. Therefore, a document in English with `flex-direction: row-reverse` and `reading-flow: flex-visual` set would have a reading order of left-to-right. Only affects flex containers.

- `flex-flow`

  - : The reading order follows the [flex-flow](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-flow) direction. Only affects flex containers.

- `grid-rows`

  - : The reading order follows the visual order of grid items by row, taking the `writing-mode` into account. Only affects {{glossary("Grid Container", "grid containers")}}.

- `grid-columns`

  - : The reading order follows the visual order of grid items by column, taking the writing mode into account. Only affects grid containers.

- `grid-order`

  - : The reading order follows the modified document order resulting from using the {{cssxref("order")}} property to change the order of items. Behaves as `normal` if no `order` was set. Only affects grid containers.

- `source-order`
  - : Enables the use of the `reading-order` property on direct children. Other than respecting the `reading-order` property, the reading order follows the order of elements in the DOM. Affects grid, flex, and block containers.

## Description

The `reading-flow` property modifies the order in which elements in a block, flex, or grid layout are rendered to speech or are navigated to when using sequential navigation such as tabbing to links or buttons.

By default, web content is read out in DOM source order; generally, the source order should express the logical reading order of the content. However, sometimes multiple layouts are applied to a document via [media queries](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_media_queries/Using_media_queries) to suit different device or user requirements.

In such cases, it is beneficial to adjust the reading order so that it still makes sense in each case. The `reading-flow` property allows you to make these adjustments, causing the reading order to match the layout order resulting from use of flexbox or CSS grid, for example.

In some cases you may wish to further fine-tune the reading order. You can use the {{cssxref("reading-order")}} property to put reading flow container children into different ordinal groups, which are read out in number order.

## Examples

### Flex value comparison

In this example, we demonstrate the effects of different `reading-flow` values on a flex container.

#### HTML

The markup includes a {{htmlelement("select")}} element for selecting different `reading-flow` values, and a wrapper {{htmlelement("div")}} containing three {{htmlelement("a")}} elements.

```html
<form>
  <label for="reading-flow">Choose reading flow:</label>
  <select id="reading-flow">
    <option>normal</option>
    <option>flex-visual</option>
    <option>flex-flow</option>
  </select>
</form>
<div class="wrapper">
  <a href="#">Item 1</a>
  <a href="#">Item 2</a>
  <a href="#">Item 3</a>
</div>
```

#### CSS

We use a {{cssxref("display")}} value of `flex` to turn the `<div>` into a flex container, and display the flex items in a row in reverse DOM order with a {{cssxref("flex-direction")}} value of `row-reverse`. Initially, we set a `reading-flow` of `normal` so the items are read or tabbed through in DOM source order.

We also set an {{cssxref("order")}} value of `1` on the first `<a>` element to cause it to display after the second and third item in the flex flow. The resulting display order of the flex items from left to right is "Item 1", "Item 3", then "Item 2".

```css
.wrapper {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row-reverse;
  reading-flow: normal;
}

a:first-child {
  order: 1;
}
```

#### JavaScript

In our script, we grab references to the `<select>` element and wrapper `<div>`, then add a [`change`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event) event listener to the `<select>` element. When a new value is selected, it is set as a `reading-flow` property value on the wrapper.

```js
const selectElem = document.getElementById("reading-flow");
const wrapperElem = document.querySelector(".wrapper");

selectElem.addEventListener("change", () => {
  wrapperElem.style.readingFlow = selectElem.value;
});
```

#### Result

The demo renders like this:

{{EmbedLiveSample('Flex value comparison', '', '100px')}}

First, try tabbing through the links with `reading-flow: normal` set. The tabbing order is "Item 1", "Item 2", then "Item 3", as that is the order of the elements in the DOM.

Now try changing the `reading-flow` value and tabbing through the links again:

- A value of `flex-visual` causes the items to be tabbed through in the visual display order resulting from the applied flexbox properties. This is "Item 1", "Item 3", then "Item 2".
- A value of `flex-flow` causes the items to be tabbed through in the direction of the flex flow. Since this is `row-reverse`, the tabbing order is "Item 2", "Item 3", then "Item 1" â€” the reverse of the display order.

### Grid value comparison

In this example, we demonstrate the effects of different `reading-flow` values on a flex container.

#### HTML

The markup includes a {{htmlelement("select")}} element for selecting different `reading-flow` values, and a wrapper {{htmlelement("div")}} containing four {{htmlelement("a")}} elements.

```html
<form>
  <label for="reading-flow">Choose reading flow:</label>
  <select id="reading-flow">
    <option>normal</option>
    <option>grid-rows</option>
    <option>grid-columns</option>
    <option>grid-order</option>
  </select>
</form>
<div class="wrapper">
  <a class="a" href="#">Item 1</a>
  <a class="b" href="#">Item 2</a>
  <a class="c" href="#">Item 3</a>
  <a class="d" href="#">Item 4</a>
</div>
```

#### CSS

We use a {{cssxref("display")}} value of `grid` to turn the `<div>` into a flex container, and display the grid items in three columns using {{cssxref("grid-template-columns")}}. We also set {{cssxref("grid-template-areas")}} to describe different placement areas in those columns, and place the `<a>` elements in those areas using {{cssxref("grid-area")}}. Initially, we set a `reading-flow` of `normal` so the items are read or tabbed through in DOM source order.

Finally, we set an {{cssxref("order")}} value of `1` on the first `<a>` element; this has no effect on the layout because it does not override the grid area placement, but it does have an effect when a certain `reading-flow` value is set, as you'll se later on.

Reading from left to right, the resulting display order of the grid items is "Item 4", "Item 2", "Item 3", then "Item 1".

```css
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 150px);
  grid-template-areas:
    "d b b"
    "c c a";
  reading-flow: normal;
}

.a {
  grid-area: a;
}
.b {
  grid-area: b;
}
.c {
  grid-area: c;
}
.d {
  grid-area: d;
}

a:first-child {
  order: 1;
}
```

#### JavaScript

In our script, we grab references to the `<select>` element and wrapper `<div>`, then add a [`change`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/change_event) event listener to the `<select>` element. When a new value is selected, it is set as a `reading-flow` property value on the wrapper.

```js
const selectElem = document.getElementById("reading-flow");
const wrapperElem = document.querySelector(".wrapper");

selectElem.addEventListener("change", () => {
  wrapperElem.style.readingFlow = selectElem.value;
});
```

#### Result

The demo renders like this:

{{EmbedLiveSample('Grid value comparison', '', '100px')}}

First, try tabbing through the links with `reading-flow: normal` set. The tabbing order is "Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3", then "Item 4", as that is the order of the elements in the DOM.

Now try changing the `reading-flow` value and tabbing through the links again:

- A value of `grid-rows` causes the items to be tabbed through in the visual display order by row. This is "Item 4", "Item 2", "Item 3", then "Item 1".
- A value of `grid-columns` causes the items to be tabbed through in the visual display order by column. This is "Item 4", "Item 3", "Item 2", then "Item 1".
- A value of `grid-order` causes the items to be tabbed through in DOM order, but taking into account any changes due to set `order` values. Since we've got `order: 1;` set on the first `<a>` element, the tabbing order is "Item 2", "Item 3", "Item 4", then "Item 1".

### Reading order adjustment on block containers

In this example, we demonstrate the effects of the `reading-flow: source-order` value on a block container.

#### HTML

The markup includes a wrapper {{htmlelement("div")}} containing four {{htmlelement("a")}} elements.

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <a class="a" href="#">Item 1</a>
  <a class="b" href="#">Item 2</a>
  <a class="c" href="#">Item 3</a>
  <a class="d" href="#">Item 4</a>
</div>
```

#### CSS

We set a `reading-flow` of `source-order` so the items are read or tabbed through in DOM source order, but modifications are allowed to the reading order via `reading-order`. We set a `reading-order` value of `1` on the first `<a>` element.

```css
.wrapper {
  reading-flow: source-order;
}

a:first-child {
  reading-order: 1;
}
```

#### Result

The demo renders like this:

{{EmbedLiveSample('Reading flow adjustment on block containers', '', '100px')}}

Try tabbing through the links: the tabbing order is "Item 2", "Item 3", "Item 4", then "Item 1" â€” the order of the elements in the DOM is followed, but Item 1 has been put in a higher reading order ordinal group than the others (the default `reading-order` value is `0`), therefore it is tabbed to last.
