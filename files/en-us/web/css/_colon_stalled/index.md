{{CSSRef}}

The **`:stalled`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-class](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) selector represents an element that is playable, such as {{htmlelement("audio")}} or {{htmlelement("video")}}, when playback is stalled.
A resource is considered to be stalled if the user has requested playback of a specific position in the media resource, but it has failed to receive any data for some amount of time.
This is different from {{cssxref(":buffering")}} in that the media element is unexpectedly not loading data when stalled (e.g. due to a network error) for around 3 seconds (the exact time is [user agent dependent](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/media.html#stall-timeout)).

> **Note:** Like with the {{cssxref(":buffering")}} pseudo-class, the element is still considered to be "playing" when it is "stalled".
> If `:stalled` matches an element, {{cssxref(":playing")}} will also match that element.
