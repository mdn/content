The **computed value** of a [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property is the value that is transferred from parent to child during inheritance. It is calculated from the [specified value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/specified_value) by:

1. Handling the special values {{cssxref("inherit")}}, {{cssxref("initial")}}, {{cssxref("revert")}}, {{cssxref("revert-layer")}}, and {{cssxref("unset")}}.
2. Doing the computation needed to reach the value described in the "Computed value" line in the property's definition table.

The computation needed to reach a property's computed value typically involves converting relative values (such as those in `em` units or percentages) to absolute values. For example, if an element has specified values `font-size: 16px` and `padding-top: 2em`, then the computed value of `padding-top` is `32px` (double the font size).

However, for some properties (those where percentages are relative to something that may require layout to determine, such as `width`, `margin-right`, `text-indent`, and `top`), percentage-specified values turn into percentage-computed values. Additionally, unitless numbers specified on the `line-height` property become the computed value, as specified. The relative values that remain in the computed value become absolute when the [used value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/used_value) is determined.

> **Note:** The {{domxref("Window.getComputedStyle", "getComputedStyle()")}} DOM API returns the [resolved value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/resolved_value), which may either be the computed value or the [used value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/used_value), depending on the property.
