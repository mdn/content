{{CSSRef}}

Any [at-rule](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/At-rule) whose body contains style rules can be nested inside another style rule using CSS nesting. Style rules nested inside at-rules take their nesting selector definition from the nearest ancestor style rule. Properties can be directly included inside a nested at-rule, acting as if they were nested in a `& {...}` block.

## at-rules that can be nested

- {{cssxref('@media')}}
- {{cssxref('@supports')}}
- {{cssxref('@layer')}}
- {{cssxref('@scope')}}
- {{cssxref('@container')}}

## Examples

### Nesting `@media` at-rule

In this example we see three blocks of CSS. The first one shows how to write typical at-rule nesting, the second is an expanded way of writing the nesting as the browser parses it, and the third one shows the non-nested equivalent.

#### Nested CSS

```css
.foo {
  display: grid;
  @media (orientation: landscape) {
    grid-auto-flow: column;
  }
}
```

#### Expanded nested CSS

```css
.foo {
  display: grid;
  @media (orientation: landscape) {
    & {
      grid-auto-flow: column;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Non-nested equivalent

```css
.foo {
  display: grid;
}

@media (orientation: landscape) {
  .foo {
    grid-auto-flow: column;
  }
}
```

### Multiple nested `@media` at-rules

At-rules can be nested within other at-rules. Below you can see an example of this, and how it would be written without nesting.

#### Nested at-rules

```css
.foo {
  display: grid;
  @media (orientation: landscape) {
    grid-auto-flow: column;
    @media (min-width: 1024px) {
      max-inline-size: 1024px;
    }
  }
}
```

#### Non-nested equivalent

```css
.foo {
  display: grid;
}
@media (orientation: landscape) {
  .foo {
    grid-auto-flow: column;
  }
}
@media (orientation: landscape) and (min-width: 1024px) {
  .foo {
    max-inline-size: 1024px;
  }
}
```

### Nesting Cascade Layers (`@layer`)

[Cascade Layers](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) can be nested to [create child-layers](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer#nesting_layers). These are joined with a `.`(dot).

#### Defining the parent & child layers

We start by defining the named cascade layers, prior to using them, without any style assignments.

```css
@layer base {
  @layer support;
}
```

#### Assigning rules to layers with nesting

Here the `.foo` selector assigns its rules to the **base** `@layer`. The nested **support** `@layer` creates the `base.support` sub-layer, and the `&` nesting selector is used to create the rules for the `.foo .bar` selector .

```css
.foo {
  @layer base {
    block-size: 100%;
    @layer support {
      & .bar {
        min-block-size: 100%;
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Equivalent without nesting

```css
@layer base {
  .foo {
    block-size: 100%;
  }
}
@layer base.support {
  .foo .bar {
    min-block-size: 100%;
  }
}
```
