{{CSSRef}}

In CSS, **`::after`** creates a [pseudo-element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) that is the last child of the selected element. It is often used to add cosmetic content to an element with the {{CSSxRef("content")}} property. It is inline by default.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/tabbed/pseudo-element-after.html", "tabbed-standard")}}

> [!NOTE]
> The pseudo-elements generated by `::before` and `::after` are inline boxes generated as if they were immediate children of the element on which they are applied, or the "originating element," and thus can not apply to _[replaced elements](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Replaced_element)_, such as {{htmlelement("img")}}, whose contents are replaced and not affected by the current document's styles.

## Syntax

```css-nolint
::after {
  content: /* value */;
  /* properties */
}
```

If the [`content`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content) property is not specified, has an invalid value, or has `normal` or `none` as a value, then the `::after` pseudo-element is not rendered. It behaves as if `display: none` is set.

> [!NOTE]
> CSS introduced the `::after` notation (with two colons) to distinguish [pseudo-classes](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) from [pseudo-elements](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements). For backward compatibility, browsers also accept `:after`, introduced earlier.

## Accessibility

Using an `::after` pseudo-element to add content is discouraged, as it is not reliably accessible to screen readers.

## Examples

### Basic usage

Let's create two classes: one for boring paragraphs and one for exciting ones. We can use these classes to add pseudo-elements to the end of paragraphs.

#### HTML

```html
<p class="boring-text">Here is some plain old boring text.</p>
<p>Here is some normal text that is neither boring nor exciting.</p>
<p class="exciting-text">Contributing to MDN is easy and fun.</p>
```

#### CSS

```css
.exciting-text::after {
  content: " <- EXCITING!";
  color: darkgreen;
  font-weight: bolder;
}

.boring-text::after {
  content: " <- BORING";
  color: darkviolet;
  font-weight: bolder;
}
```

### Decorative example

We can style text or images in the {{CSSxRef("content")}} property almost any way we want.

#### HTML

```html
<span class="ribbon">Look at the orange box after this text. </span>
```

#### CSS

```css
.ribbon {
  background-color: #5bc8f7;
}

.ribbon::after {
  content: "This is a fancy orange box.";
  background-color: #ffba10;
  border-color: black;
  border-style: dotted;
}
```

### Tooltips

This example uses `::after`, in conjunction with the [`attr()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/attr) CSS expression and a `data-descr` [custom data attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*), to create tooltips. No JavaScript is required!

We can also support keyboard users with this technique, by adding a `tabindex` of `0` to make each `span` keyboard focusable, and using a CSS `:focus` selector. This shows how flexible `::before` and `::after` can be, though for the most accessible experience a semantic disclosure widget created in some other way (such as with [details and summary](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) elements) is likely to be more appropriate.

#### HTML

```html
<p>
  Here we have some
  <span tabindex="0" data-descr="collection of words and punctuation">
    text
  </span>
  with a few
  <span tabindex="0" data-descr="small popups that appear when hovering">
    tooltips</span
  >.
</p>
```

#### CSS

```css
span[data-descr] {
  position: relative;
  text-decoration: underline;
  color: #00f;
  cursor: help;
}

span[data-descr]:hover::after,
span[data-descr]:focus::after {
  content: attr(data-descr);
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  top: 24px;
  min-width: 200px;
  border: 1px #aaaaaa solid;
  border-radius: 10px;
  background-color: #ffffcc;
  padding: 12px;
  color: #000000;
  font-size: 14px;
  z-index: 1;
}
```
