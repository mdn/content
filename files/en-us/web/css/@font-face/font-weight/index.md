{{CSSRef}}

The **`font-weight`** CSS descriptor allows authors to specify font weights for the fonts specified in the {{cssxref("@font-face")}} rule. The {{cssxref("font-weight")}} property can separately be used to set how thick or thin characters in text should be displayed.

For a particular font family, authors can download various font faces which correspond to the different styles of the same font family, and then use the `font-weight `descriptor to explicitly specify the font face's weights. The values for the CSS descriptor is same as that of its corresponding font property.

There are generally limited weights available for a particular font family. When a specified weight doesn't exist, a nearby weight is used. Fonts lacking bold are often synthesized by the user agent. To prevent this, use {{cssxref('font-synthesis')}} property.

## Syntax

```css
/* Single values */
font-weight: normal;
font-weight: bold;
font-weight: 400;

/* Multiple Values */
font-weight: normal bold;
font-weight: 300 500;
```

The `font-weight` property is described using any one of the values listed below.

### Values

- `normal`
  - : Normal font weight. Same as `400`.
- `bold`
  - : Bold font weight. Same as `700`.
- `<number>`
  - : A {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}} value between 1 and 1000, inclusive. Higher numbers represent weights that are bolder than (or as bold as) lower numbers. Certain commonly used values correspond to common weight names, as described in the [Common weight name mapping](#common_weight_name_mapping) section below.

In earlier versions of the `font-weight` specification, the property accepts only keyword values and the numeric values 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900; non-variable fonts can only really make use of these set values, although fine-grained values (e.g. 451) will be translated to one of these values for non-variable fonts.

CSS Fonts Level 4 extends the syntax to accept any number between 1 and 1000, inclusive, and introduces {{anch("Variable fonts")}}, which can make use of this much finer-grained range of font weights.

### Common weight name mapping

The numerical values `100` to `900` roughly correspond to the following common weight names:

| Value | Common weight name        |
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| 100   | Thin (Hairline)           |
| 200   | Extra Light (Ultra Light) |
| 300   | Light                     |
| 400   | Normal                    |
| 500   | Medium                    |
| 600   | Semi Bold (Demi Bold)     |
| 700   | Bold                      |
| 800   | Extra Bold (Ultra Bold)   |
| 900   | Black (Heavy)             |

### Variable fonts

Most fonts have a particular weight which corresponds to one of the numbers in [Common weight name mapping](#common_weight_name_mapping). However some fonts, called variable fonts, can support a range of weights with more or less fine granularity, and this can give the designer a much closer degree of control over the chosen weight.

For TrueType or OpenType variable fonts, the "wght" variation is used to implement varying weights.

## Accessibility concerns

People experiencing low vision conditions may have difficulty reading text set with a `font-weight` value of `100` (Thin/Hairline) or `200` (Extra Light), especially if the font has a [low contrast color ratio](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color#accessibility_concerns).

## Examples

### Setting normal font weight in a @font-face rule

The following finds a local Open Sans font or imports it, and allows using the font for normal font weights.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Open Sans";
  src: local("Open Sans") format("woff2"),
       url("/fonts/OpenSans-Regular-webfont.woff") format("woff");
  font-weight: 400;
}
```
