The **`::target-text`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) represents the text that has been scrolled to if the browser supports [text fragments](/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Fragment/Text_fragments). It allows authors to choose how to highlight that section of text.

The `::target-text` pseudo-element follows a special inheritance model common to all highlight pseudo-elements. For more details on how this inheritance works, see the [Highlight pseudo-elements inheritance](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements#highlight_pseudo-elements_inheritance) section.

## Syntax

```css
::target-text {
  /* ... */
}
```

## Examples

### Highlighting text fragments

```css
::target-text {
  background-color: rebeccapurple;
  color: white;
}
```
