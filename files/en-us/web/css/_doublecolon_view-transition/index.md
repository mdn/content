{{CSSRef}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`::view-transition`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) represents the root of the [view transitions](/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API) overlay, which contains all view transitions and sits over the top of all other page content.

During a view transition, `::view-transition` is included in the associated pseudo-element tree as explained in [The view transition process](/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API#the_view_transition_process). It is the top-level node of this tree, and has one or more {{cssxref("::view-transition-group")}}s as children.

`::view-transition` is given the following default styling in the UA stylesheet:

```css
html::view-transition {
  position: fixed;
  inset: 0;
}
```

All {{cssxref("::view-transition-group")}} pseudo-elements are positioned relative to the view transition root.

## Syntax

```css
::view-transition {
  /* ... */
}
```

## Examples

```css
::view-transition {
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);
}
