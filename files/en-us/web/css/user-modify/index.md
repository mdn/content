{{CSSRef}}{{Non-standard_Header}}{{Deprecated_Header}}

The **`user-modify`** property has no effect in Firefox. It was originally planned toÂ determine whether or not the content of an element can be edited by a user.

```css
/* Keyword values */
user-modify: read-only;
user-modify: read-write;
user-modify: write-only;

/* Global values */
user-modify: inherit;
user-modify: initial;
user-modify: revert;
user-modify: unset;
```

> **Warning:** This property has been replaced by the {{HTMLAttrxRef("contenteditable")}} attribute.

## Syntax

The `-moz-user-modify` property is specified as one of the keyword values from the list below.

### Values

- `read-only`
  - : Default value. Contents are read-only.
- `read-write`
  - : The user is able to read and write contents.
- `read-write-plaintext-only` {{Non-standard_Inline}}
  - : Same as `read-write`, but rich text formatting will be lost.
- `write-only`
  - : The user is able to edit the content, but not to read it.

## Specifications

Not part of any standard. A similar property, `user-focus`, was proposed in [early drafts of a predecessor of the CSS3 UI specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/2000/WD-css3-userint-20000216), but was rejected by the working group.
