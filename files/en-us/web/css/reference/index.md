{{CSSRef}}

Use this **CSS reference** to browse an [alphabetical index](#index) of all of the standard [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) properties, [pseudo-classes](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes), [pseudo-elements](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements), [data types](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Types), [functional notations](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Functions) and [at-rules](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/At-rule). You can also browse [key CSS concepts](#concepts) and a list of [selectors organized by type](#selectors). Also included is a brief [DOM-CSS / CSSOM reference](#dom-css_cssom).

## Basic rule syntax

### Style rule syntax

```css
style-rule ::=
    selectors-list {
      properties-list
    }
```

Where:

```css
selectors-list ::=
    selector[:pseudo-class] [::pseudo-element]
    [, selectors-list]

properties-list ::=
    [property : value] [; properties-list]
```

See the index of [_selectors_](#selectors), [_pseudo-classes_](#pseudo), and _[pseudo-elements](#pseudo)_ below. The syntax for each specified _value_ depends on the data type defined for each specified _property_.

#### Style rule examples

```css
strong {
  color: red;
}

div.menu-bar li:hover > ul {
  display: block;
}
```

For a beginner-level introduction to the syntax of selectors, see our [guide on CSS Selectors](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors). Be aware that any [syntax](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Syntax) error in a rule definition invalidates the entire rule. Invalid rules are ignored by the browser. Note that CSS rule definitions are entirely (ASCII) [text-based](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-syntax-3/#intro), whereas DOM-CSS / CSSOM (the rule management system) is [object-based](https://www.w3.org/TR/cssom/#introduction).

### At-rule syntax

As the structure of at-rules varies widely, please see [At-rule](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/At-rule) to find the syntax of the specific one you want.

## Selectors

The following are the various [selectors](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors), which allow styles to be conditional based on various features of elements within the DOM.

### Basic selectors

**Basic selectors** are fundamental selectors; these are the most basic selectors that are frequently combined to create other, more complex selectors.

- [Universal selector](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Universal_selectors) `*`
- [Type selector](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Type_selectors) `elementname`
- [Class selector](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors) `.classname`
- [ID selector](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ID_selectors) `#idname`
- [Attribute selector](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors) `[attr=value]`

### Grouping selectors

- [Selector list](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Selector_list) `A, B`
  - : Specifies that both `A` and `B` elements are selected. This is a grouping method to select several matching elements.

### Combinators

Combinators are selectors that establish a relationship between two or more simple selectors, such as "`A` is a child of `B`" or "`A` is adjacent to `B`", creating a complex selector.

- [Adjacent sibling combinator](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator) `A + B`
  - : Specifies that the elements selected by both `A` and `B` have the same parent and that the element selected by `B` immediately follows the element selected by `A` horizontally.
- [General sibling combinator](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/General_sibling_combinator) `A ~ B`
  - : Specifies that the elements selected by both `A` and `B` share the same parent and that the element selected by `A` comes before—but not necessarily immediately before—the element selected by `B`.
- [Child combinator](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Child_combinator) `A > B`
  - : Specifies that the element selected by `B` is the direct child of the element selected by `A`.
- [Descendant combinator](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_combinator) `A B`
  - : Specifies that the element selected by `B` is a descendant of the element selected by `A`, but is not necessarily a direct child.
- [Column combinator](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Column_combinator) `A || B` {{Experimental_Inline}}
  - : Specifies that the element selected by `B` is located within the table column specified by `A`. Elements which span multiple columns are considered to be a member of all of those columns.

### Pseudo

- [Pseudo classes](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) `:`
  - : Specifies a special state of the selected element(s).
- [Pseudo elements](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) `::`
  - : Represents entities that are not included in HTML.

### Major object types

- {{DOMxRef("Document.styleSheets")}}
- `{{DOMxRef("StyleSheetList", "styleSheets", "", 1)}}[i].{{DOMxRef("CSSRuleList", "cssRules", "", 1)}}`
- `cssRules[i].{{DOMxRef("CSSRule.cssText", "cssText", "", 1)}}` (selector & style)
- `cssRules[i].{{DOMxRef("CSSStyleRule.selectorText", "selectorText", "", 1)}}`
- {{DOMxRef("HTMLElement.style")}}
- `HTMLElement.style.{{DOMxRef("CSSStyleDeclaration.cssText", "cssText", "", 1)}}` (just style)
- {{DOMxRef("Element.className")}}
- {{DOMxRef("Element.classList")}}

### Important methods

- {{DOMxRef("CSSStyleSheet.insertRule()")}}
- {{DOMxRef("CSSStyleSheet.deleteRule()")}}
