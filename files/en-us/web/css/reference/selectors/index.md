**CSS selectors** are patterns used in [CSS rules](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_syntax/Syntax#css_rulesets) to target and select specific elements for styling.

For example, to style paragraphs, you will use the `p` [type selector](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/Type_selectors) to select all {{HTMLElement("p")}} elements and apply a style to them:

```css
/* Set font size on all <p> elements */
p {
  font-size: 12px;
  color: rebeccapurple;
}
```

## Syntax

```css
/* Select elements and apply styles */
selector {
  property: value;
}
```
