{{CSSRef}}

The **`speak-as`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property is used to define how [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) content is spoken. The one to three enumerated key terms determine the manner by which elements and text get rendered by aural technologies, such as {{glossary("screen reader", "screen readers")}} and digital assistants.

This property applies to all content, including pseudo-elements, with the exception {{cssxref("::marker")}} pseudo-elements constructed via a {{cssxref("@counter-style")}} with a defined [`speak-as`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@counter-style/speak-as) descriptor, which takes precedence over any inherited `speak-as` property value.

## Syntax

```css
/* single value syntax */
speak-as: normal;
speak-as: spell-out;
speak-as: literal-punctuation;
speak-as: digits;
speak-as: no-punctuation;

/* multiple value syntax */
speak-as: spell-out literal-punctuation;
speak-as: spell-out no-punctuation;
speak-as: digits literal-punctuation;
speak-as: digits no-punctuation;
speak-as: spell-out digits literal-punctuation;
speak-as: spell-out digits no-punctuation;
```

### Values

- `normal`
  - : Normal pronunciation rules with punctuation replaced by pauses. For example, "Hello, world!" would be pronounced as "Hello (pause) world (pause)". This is the default value.
- `spell-out`
  - : Content is spelled out letter by letter. For example, "role" would be pronounced as "r" "o" "l" "e".
- `literal-punctuation`
  - : Punctuation marks are spelled out literally. For example, "Hello, world!" would be pronounced as "Hello comma world exclamation mark."
- `digits`
  - : Numbers are pronounced as individual digits. For example, "31" would be pronounced as "three one".
- `no-punctuation`
  - : Content is pronounced normally without any punctuation. For example, "Hello, world!" would be pronounced as "Hello" "world".

> [!NOTE]
> Support of the `speak-as` property is limited and inconsistently implemented across different assistive technologies, such as screen readers or speech synthesizers. To ensure any pronunciation-dependent critical information remains user-friendly and accessible to a wide audience, do not rely solely on this CSS property to define how this information content is presented aurally.
