{{CSSRef}}

The **`font-weight`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the weight (or boldness) of the font. The weights available depend on the {{cssxref("font-family")}} that is currently set.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/css/font-weight.html")}}

## Syntax

```css
/* Keyword values */
font-weight: normal;
font-weight: bold;

/* Keyword values relative to the parent */
font-weight: lighter;
font-weight: bolder;

/* Numeric keyword values */
font-weight: 100;
font-weight: 200;
font-weight: 300;
font-weight: 400;// normal
font-weight: 500;
font-weight: 600;
font-weight: 700;// bold
font-weight: 800;
font-weight: 900;

/* Global values */
font-weight: inherit;
font-weight: initial;
font-weight: revert;
font-weight: unset;
```

The `font-weight` property is specified using any one of the values listed below.

### Values

- `normal`
  - : Normal font weight. Same as `400`.
- `bold`
  - : Bold font weight. Same as `700`.
- `lighter`
  - : One relative font weight lighter than the parent element. Note that only four font weights are considered for relative weight calculation; see the {{anch("Meaning of relative weights")}} section below.
- `bolder`
  - : One relative font weight heavier than the parent element. Note that only four font weights are considered for relative weight calculation; see the {{anch("Meaning of relative weights")}} section below.
- `<number>`
  - : A {{cssxref("&lt;number&gt;")}} value between 1 and 1000, inclusive. Higher numbers represent weights that are bolder than (or as bold as) lower numbers. Certain commonly used values correspond to common weight names, as described in the [Common weight name mapping](#common_weight_name_mapping) section below.

In earlier versions of the `font-weight` specification, the property accepts only keyword values and the numeric values 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, and 900; non-variable fonts can only really make use of these set values, although fine-grained values (e.g. 451) will be translated to one of these values for non-variable fonts using the {{anch("Fallback weights")}} system.

CSS Fonts Level 4 extends the syntax to accept any number between 1 and 1000 and introduces {{anch("Variable fonts")}}, which can make use of this much finer-grained range of font weights.

### Fallback weights

If the exact weight given is unavailable, then the following rule is used to determine the weight actually rendered:

- If the target weight given is between `400` and `500` inclusive:

  - Look for available weights between the target and `500`, in ascending order.
  - If no match is found, look for available weights less than the target, in descending order.
  - If no match is found, look for available weights greater than `500`, in ascending order.

- If a weight less than `400` is given, look for available weights less than the target, in descending order. If no match is found, look for available weights greater than the target, in ascending order.
- If a weight greater than `500` is given, look for available weights greater than the target, in ascending order. If no match is found, look for available weights less than the target, in descending order.

### Meaning of relative weights

When `lighter` or `bolder` is specified, the below chart shows how the absolute font weight of the element is determined.

Note that when using relative weights, only four font weights are considered â€” thin (100), normal (400), bold (700), and heavy (900). If a font-family has more weights available, they are ignored for the purposes of relative weight calculation.

### Common weight name mapping

The numerical values `100` to `900` roughly correspond to the following common weight names (see the [OpenType specification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#usweightclass)):

| Value | Common weight name                                                                                                                |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 100   | Thin (Hairline)                                                                                                                   |
| 200   | Extra Light (Ultra Light)                                                                                                         |

| 400   | Normal (Regular)                                                                                                                  |

| 700   | Bold                                                                                                                              |

### Variable fonts

Most fonts have a particular weight which corresponds to one of the numbers in [Common weight name mapping](#common_weight_name_mapping). However some fonts, called variable fonts, can support a range of weights with a more or less fine granularity, and this can give the designer a much closer degree of control over the chosen weight.

For TrueType or OpenType variable fonts, the "wght" variation is used to implement varying widths.

> **Note:** For the example below to work, you'll need a browser that supports the CSS Fonts Level 4 syntax in which `font-weight` can be any number between `1` and `1000`. The demo loads with `font-weight: 500;`. Change the value to see the weight of the text change.

## Accessibility concerns

People experiencing low vision conditions may have difficulty reading text set with a `font-weight` value of `100` (Thin/Hairline) or `200` (Extra Light), especially if the font has a [low contrast color ratio](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color#accessibility_concerns).

## Examples

### Setting font weights

#### HTML

```html
<p>
  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the
  bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
  book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
  it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice "without pictures or
  conversations?"
</p>

<div>I'm heavy<br/>
  <span>I'm lighter</span>
</div>
```

#### CSS

```css
/* Set paragraph text to be bold. */
p {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* Set div text to two steps heavier than
   normal but less than a standard bold. */
div {
 font-weight: 600;
}

/* Set span text to be one step lighter
   than its parent. */
span {
  font-weight: lighter;
}
```
