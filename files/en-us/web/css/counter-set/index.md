{{CSSRef}}

The **`counter-set`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets a [CSS counter](/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Counters) to a given value. It manipulates the value of existing counters, and willÂ only create new counters if there isn't already a counter of the given name on the element.

> **Note:** The counter's value can be incremented or decremented using the {{cssxref("counter-increment")}} CSS property.

## Syntax

```css
/* Set "my-counter" to 0 */
counter-set: my-counter;

/* Set "my-counter" to -1 */
counter-set: my-counter -1;

/* Set "counter1" to 1, and "counter2" to 4 */
counter-set: counter1 1 counter2 4;

/* Cancel any counter that could have been set in less specific rules */
counter-set: none;

/* Global values */
counter-set: inherit;
counter-set: initial;
counter-set: revert;
counter-set: unset;
```

The `counter-set` property is specified as either one of the following:

- A `<custom-ident>` naming the counter, followed optionally by an `<integer>`. You may specify as many counters to reset as you want, with each name or name-number pair separated by a space.
- The keyword value `none`.

### Values

- {{cssxref("custom-ident", "&lt;custom-ident&gt;")}}
  - : The name of the counter to set.
- {{cssxref("&lt;integer&gt;")}}
  - : The value to set the counter to on each occurrence of the element. Defaults to `0` if not specified. If there isn't currently a counter of the given name on the element, the element will create a new counter of the given name with a starting value of 0 (though it may then immediately set or increment that value to something different).
- `none`
  - : No counter set is to be performed. This can be used to override a `counter-set` defined in a less specific rule.
