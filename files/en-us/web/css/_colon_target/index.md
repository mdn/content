{{CSSRef}}

The **`:target`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-class](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) represents a unique element (the _target element_) with an [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes#id) matching the URL's fragment.

```css
/* Selects an element with an ID matching the current URL's fragment */
:target {
  border: 2px solid black;
}
```

For example, the following URL has a fragment (denoted by the _#_ sign) that points to an element called `section2`:

```url
http://www.example.com/index.html#section2
```

The following element would be selected by a `:target` selector when the current URL is equal to the above:

```html
<section id="section2">Example</section>
```

## Syntax

```css
:target {
  /* ... */
}
```

> **Note:** Due to [a possible bug in the CSS specification](https://discourse.wicg.io/t/target-css-does-not-work-because-shadowroot-does-not-set-a-target-element/2070), `:target` doesn't work within a [web component](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) because the [shadow root](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot) doesn't pass the target element down to the shadow tree.

## Examples

### A table of contents

The `:target` pseudo-class can be used to highlight the portion of a page that has been linked to from a table of contents.

#### HTML

```html
<h3>Table of Contents</h3>
<ol>
  <li><a href="#p1">Jump to the first paragraph!</a></li>
  <li><a href="#p2">Jump to the second paragraph!</a></li>
  <li>
    <a href="#nowhere">
      This link goes nowhere, because the target doesn't exist.
    </a>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>My Fun Article</h3>
<p id="p1">
  You can target <i>this paragraph</i> using a URL fragment. Click on the link
  above to try out!
</p>
<p id="p2">
  This is <i>another paragraph</i>, also accessible from the links above. Isn't
  that delightful?
</p>
```

#### CSS

```css
p:target {
  background-color: gold;
}

/* Add a pseudo-element inside the target element */
p:target::before {
  font: 70% sans-serif;
  content: "â–º";
  color: limegreen;
  margin-right: 0.25em;
}

/* Style italic elements within the target element */
p:target i {
  color: red;
}
```
