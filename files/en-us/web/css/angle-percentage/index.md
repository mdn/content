{{CSSRef}}

The **`<angle-percentage>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Types) represents a value that can be either a {{Cssxref("angle")}} or a {{Cssxref("percentage")}}.

Where an `<angle-percentage>` is specified as an allowable type, this means that the percentage resolves to an angle and therefore can be used in a {{Cssxref("calc", "calc()")}} expression.

## Syntax

Refer to the documentation for {{Cssxref("angle")}} and {{Cssxref("percentage")}} for details of the individual syntaxes allowed by this type.
