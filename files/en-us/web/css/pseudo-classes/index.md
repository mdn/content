{{CSSRef}}

A [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) **_pseudo-class_** is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific state of the selected element(s). For example, the pseudo-class {{CSSxRef(":hover")}} can be used to select a button when a user's pointer hovers over the button and this selected button can then be styled.

```css
/* Any button over which the user's pointer is hovering */
button:hover {
  color: blue;
}
```

A pseudo-class consists of a colon (`:`) followed by the pseudo-class name (e.g., `:hover`). A functional pseudo-class also contains a pair of parentheses to define the arguments (e.g., `:dir()`). The element that a pseudo-class is attached to is defined as an _anchor element_ (e.g., `button` in case `button:hover`).

Pseudo-classes let you apply a style to an element not only in relation to the content of the document tree, but also in relation to external factors like the history of the navigator ({{CSSxRef(":visited")}}, for example), the status of its content (like {{CSSxRef(":checked")}} on certain form elements), or the position of the mouse (like {{CSSxRef(":hover")}}, which lets you know if the mouse is over an element or not).

> [!NOTE]
> In contrast to pseudo-classes, [pseudo-elements](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) can be used to style a _specific part_ of an element.

## Elemental pseudo-classes

These pseudo-classes relate to the core identity of elements.

- {{CSSxRef(":defined")}}
  - : Matches any element that is defined.

## Element display state pseudo-classes

These pseudo-classes enable the selection of elements based on their display states.

  - : Matches a popover element that is currently in the showing state.

  - : Matches an element that is currently in fullscreen mode.
- {{CSSxRef(":picture-in-picture")}}
  - : Matches an element that is currently in picture-in-picture mode.

## Input pseudo-classes

These pseudo-classes relate to form elements, and enable selecting elements based on HTML attributes and the state that the field is in before and after interaction.

- {{CSSxRef(":enabled")}}
  - : Represents a user interface element that is in an enabled state.

  - : Matches a user-input element which is empty, containing an empty string or other null input.

  - : Matches an element with valid contents. For example, an input element with the type 'email' that contains a validly formed email address or an empty value if the control is not required.
- {{CSSxRef(":invalid")}}
  - : Matches an element with invalid contents. For example, an input element with type 'email' with a name entered.

  - : Applies to elements with range limitations. For example, a slider control when the selected value is in the allowed range.
- {{CSSxRef(":out-of-range")}}
  - : Applies to elements with range limitations. For example, a slider control when the selected value is outside the allowed range.
- {{CSSxRef(":required")}}
  - : Matches when a form element is required.

- {{CSSxRef(":target")}}
  - : Matches the element which is the target of the document URL.
- {{CSSxRef(":target-within")}}
  - : Matches elements which are the target of the document URL, but also elements which have a descendant which is the target of the document URL.
- {{CSSxRef(":scope")}}
