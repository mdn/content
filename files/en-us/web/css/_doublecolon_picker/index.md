{{CSSRef}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`::picker()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) targets the picker part of an element, for example the drop-down picker of a [customizable select element](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Customizable_select).

## Syntax

```css-nolint
::picker(<ident>) {
  /* ... */
}
```

### Parameters

- {{cssxref("ident")}}
  - : A string representing the element whose picker you want to target. The following values are available:
    - `select`
      - : The drop-down picker of customizable select elements.

## Description

The `::picker()` pseudo-element targets the picker part of a form control, that is, the pop-up part that appears to allow you to make a selection when you press the control button. It is only available to target when the originating element has a picker and has base appearance set on it via the {{cssxref("appearance")}} property `base-select` value.

The `::picker(select)` selector targets all descendants of customizable `<select>` element except for the first `<button>` child; these descendants are grouped together by the browser and rendered as the picker. The first `<button>` child represents the control button that opens the picker when pressed.

This allows you to target all of the picker contents as a single entity, for example if you want to customize its border, animate it when it appears and disappears, or position it somewhere different to the default position. Our [customizable select elements](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Customizable_select) guide shows many examples of `::picker(select)` usage.

### Picker popover behavior

The `<select>` element and the picker have an implicit invoker/popover relationship assigned to them automatically, as specified by the [Popover API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API). See [Using the Popover API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API/Using) for more details of popover behavior, and see [Animating the picker drop-down using popover states](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Customizable_select#animating_the_picker_using_popover_states) for a typical use case allowed by the implicit popover association.

### Picker anchor positioning

A further side-effect of the implicit invoker/popover relationship mentioned above is that the `<select>` element and the picker also have an implicit anchor reference, meaning that the picker is automatically associated with the select via [CSS anchor positioning](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning). This has several advantages, most notably:

- The browser default styles position the picker relative to the button (the anchor) and you can customize this position as explained in [Positioning elements relative to their anchor](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning/Using#positioning_elements_relative_to_their_anchor). For reference, the related default styles are as follows:

  ```css
  inset: auto;
  margin: 0;
  min-inline-size: anchor-size(self-inline);
  min-block-size: 1lh;
  /* Go to the edge of the viewport, and add scrollbars if needed. */
  max-block-size: stretch;
  overflow: auto;
  /* Below and span-right, by default. */
  position-area: block-end span-inline-end;
  ```

- The browser default styles also define some position-try fallbacks that reposition the picker if it is in danger of overflowing the viewport. Position-try fallbacks are explained in [Handling overflow: try fallbacks and conditional hiding](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning/Try_options_hiding). For reference, the related default fallback styles are as follows:

  ```css
  position-try-order: most-block-size;
  position-try-fallbacks:
    /* First try above and span-right, */
    /* then below but span-left, */
    /* then above and span-left. */
    block-start span-inline-end,
    block-end span-inline-start,
    block-start span-inline-start;
  ```

## Examples

### Basic custom select usage

To opt-in to the custom select functionality and minimal browser base styles (and remove the OS-provided styling), the `<select>` element and its picker both need to have an {{cssxref("appearance")}} value of `base-select` set on them:

```css
select,
::picker(select) {
  appearance: base-select;
}
```

You could then, for example, remove the picker's default black {{cssxref("border")}}:

```css
::picker(select) {
  border: none;
}
```
