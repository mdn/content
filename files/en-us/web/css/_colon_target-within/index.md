The **`:target-within`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-class](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) represents an element that is a target element or _contains_ an element that is a target. A target element is a unique element with an [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes#attr-id) matching the URL's fragment. In other words, it represents an element that is itself matched by the {{CSSxRef(":target")}} pseudo-class or has a descendant that is matched by `:target`. (This includes descendants in [shadow trees](/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM).)

```css
/* Selects a <div> when one of its descendants is a target */
div:target-within {
  background: cyan;
}
```

<article>

<h3>My Fun Article</h3>
<p id="p1">You can target <i>this paragraph</i> using a
  URL fragment. Click on the link above to try out!</p>
<p id="p2">This is <i>another paragraph</i>, also accessible
  from the links above. Isn't that delightful?</p>
</article>
```

article:target-within {
  background-color: gold;
