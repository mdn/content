{{CSSRef}}

**CSS counters** let you adjust the appearance of content based on its location in a document.
For example, you can use counters to automatically number the headings in a webpage, or to change the numbering on ordered lists.

Counters are, in essence, variables maintained by CSS whose values may be incremented or decremented by CSS rules that track how many times they're used.
You can define your own named counters, and you can also manipulate the `list-item` counter that is created by default for all ordered lists.

## Using counters

To use a counter it must first be initialized to a value with the {{cssxref("counter-reset")}} property.
The counter's value can then be increased or decreased using {{cssxref("counter-increment")}} property.
The current value of a counter is displayed using the {{cssxref("counter", "counter()")}} or {{cssxref("counters", "counters()")}} function, typically within a [pseudo-element](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) {{CSSxRef("content")}} property.

Counters can only be set, reset, or incremented in elements that generate boxes.
For example, if an element is set to `display: none` then any counter operation on that element will be ignored.

The properties of counters can be scoped to specific elements using style containment which is described in more detail in the {{cssxref("contain")}} property.

### Manipulating a counter's value

To use a CSS counter, it must first be initialized to a value with the {{cssxref("counter-reset")}} property.
The property can also be used to change the counter value to any specific number.

Below we initialize a counter named `section` to the default value (0).

```css
counter-reset: section;
```

You can also initialize multiple counters, optionally specifying an initial value for each.
Below we initialize the `section` and `topic` counters to the default value, and the `page` counter to 3.

```css
counter-reset: section page 3 topic;
```

Once initialized, a counter's value can be increased or decreased using {{cssxref("counter-increment")}}.
For example, the following declaration would increment the `section` counter by one on every `h3` tag.

```css
h3::before {
  counter-increment: section; /* Increment the value of section counter by 1 */
}
```

You can specify the value to increment or decrement the counter after the counter name, using a positive or negative number.

The counter's name must not be `none`, `inherit`, or `initial`; otherwise the declaration is ignored.

### Displaying a counter

The value of a counter can be displayed using either the {{cssxref("counter", "counter()")}} or {{cssxref("counters", "counters()")}} function in a {{cssxref("content")}} property.

For example, the following declaration uses `counter()` to prefix each `h3` heading with the text `Section <number>:`, where `<number>` is the value of the count in decimal (the default display style):

```css
h3::before {
  counter-increment: section; /* Increment the value of section counter by 1 */
  content: "Section " counter(section) ": "; /* Display counter value in default style (decimal) */
}
```

The {{cssxref("counter", "counter()")}} function is used when the numbering of nesting levels does not include the context of parent levels.
For example, here each nested level restarts from one:

```
1 One
  1 Nested one
  2 Nested two
2 Two
  1 Nested one
  2 Nested two
  3 Nested three
3 Three
```

The {{cssxref("counters", "counters()")}} function is used when the count for nested levels must include the count from parent levels.
For example, you might use this to lay out sections as shown:

```
1 One
  1.1 Nested one
  1.2 Nested two
2 Two
  2.1 Nested one
  2.2 Nested two
  2.3 Nested three
3 Three
```

The {{cssxref("counter", "counter()")}} function has two forms: `counter(<counter-name>)` and `counter(<counter-name>, <counter-style>)`.
The generated text is the value of the innermost counter of the given name in scope at the pseudo-element.

The {{cssxref("counters", "counters()")}} function also has two forms: `counters(<counter-name>, <separator>)` and `counters(<counter-name>, <separator>, <counter-style>)`.
The generated text is the value of all counters with the given name in scope at the given pseudo-element, from outermost to innermost, separated by the specified string (`<separator>`).

The counter is rendered in the specified `<counter-style>` for both methods (`decimal` by default).
You can use any of the {{cssxref("list-style-type")}} values or your own [custom styles](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Counter_Styles).

Examples showing the use of `counter()` and `counters()` are given below in the [basic example](#basic_example) and [Example of a nested counter](#example_of_a_nested_counter), respectively.

### Reversed counters

A reversed counter is one that is intended to count down (decrement) rather than up (increment).
Reversed counters are created using the `reversed()` function notation when naming the counter in {{cssxref("counter-reset")}}.

Reversed counters have a default initial value equal to the number of elements (unlike normal counters, which have a default value of 0).
This makes it easy to implement a counter that counts from the number of elements down to one.

For example, to create a reversed counter named `section` with a default initial value, you would use the following syntax:

```css
counter-reset: reversed(section);
```

You can of course specify any initial value that you like.

The counter value is decreased by specifying a negative value for {{cssxref("counter-increment")}}.

> **Note:** You can also use {{cssxref("counter-increment")}} to decrement a non-reversed counter.
> The main benefit of using a reversed counter is the default initial value, and that the `list-item` counter automatically decrements reversed counters.

### List item counters

Ordered lists, as created using {{HTMLElement("ol")}} elements, implicitly have a counter named `list-item`.

Like other counters, this has a default initial value of 0 for upward counters and "number of items" for reversed counters.
Unlike author-created counters, `list-item` _automatically_ increments or decrements by one for each list element, depending on whether or not the counter is reversed.

The `list-item` counter can be used to manipulate the default behavior of ordered lists using CSS.
For example, you can change the default initial value, or use {{cssxref("counter-increment")}} to change the way in which the list items increment or decrement.

## Examples

### Basic example

This example adds "Section \[the value of the counter]:" to the beginning of each heading.

#### CSS

```css
body {
  counter-reset: section; /* Set a counter named 'section', and its initial value is 0. */
}

h3::before {
  counter-increment: section; /* Increment the value of section counter by 1 */
  content: "Section " counter(section) ": "; /* Display the word 'Section ', the value of
                                                section counter, and a colon before the content
                                                of each h3 */
}
```

### Basic example: reversed counter

This example is the same as the one above but uses a reversed counter.
If your browser supports the `reversed()` function notation, the result will look like this:

![reversed counter](reversed_headings_basic.png)

#### CSS

```css
body {
  counter-reset: reversed(
    section
  ); /* Set a counter named 'section', and its initial value is 0. */
}

h3::before {
  counter-increment: section -1; /* Decrement the value of section counter by 1 */
  content: "Section " counter(section) ": "; /* Display the word 'Section ', the value of
                                                section counter, and a colon before the content
                                                of each h3 */
}
```

#### HTML

```html
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<h3>Body</h3>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
```

#### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample("Basic example: reversed counter", "100%", 150)}}

### A more sophisticated example

A counter need not necessarily be shown every time it is incremented.
This example counts all links with the counter showing only when a link has no text, as a convenient replacement.

#### CSS

```css
:root {
  counter-reset: link;
}

a[href] {
  counter-increment: link;
}

a[href]:empty::after {
  content: "[" counter(link) "]";
}
```

### Example of a nested counter

A CSS counter can be especially useful for making outlined lists, because a new instance of the counter is automatically created in child elements.
Using the {{cssxref("counters", "counters()")}} function, separating text can be inserted between different levels of nested counters.

#### CSS

```css
ol {
  counter-reset: section; /* Creates a new instance of the
                             section counter with each ol
                             element */
  list-style-type: none;
}

li::before {
  counter-increment: section; /* Increments only this instance
                                            of the section counter */
  content: counters(section, ".") " "; /* Combines the values of all instances
                                          of the section counter, separated
                                          by a period */
}
```

#### HTML

```html-nolint
<ol>
  <li>item</li>          <!-- 1     -->
  <li>item               <!-- 2     -->
    <ol>
      <li>item</li>      <!-- 2.1   -->
      <li>item</li>      <!-- 2.2   -->
      <li>item           <!-- 2.3   -->
        <ol>
          <li>item</li>  <!-- 2.3.1 -->
          <li>item</li>  <!-- 2.3.2 -->
        </ol>
        <ol>
          <li>item</li>  <!-- 2.3.1 -->
          <li>item</li>  <!-- 2.3.2 -->
          <li>item</li>  <!-- 2.3.3 -->
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>item</li>      <!-- 2.4   -->
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>item</li>          <!-- 3     -->
  <li>item</li>          <!-- 4     -->
</ol>
<ol>
  <li>item</li>          <!-- 1     -->
  <li>item</li>          <!-- 2     -->
</ol>
```
