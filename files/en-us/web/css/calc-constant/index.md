{{CSSRef}}

The **`<calc-constant>`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [data type](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Types) represents a well-known constants, such as `e` and `π`.

Rather than require authors to manually type out several digits of these constants, a few of them are provided directly by CSS.

- `e` is the base of the natural logarithm, approximately equal to `2.7182818284590452354`.
- `pi` is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately equal to `3.1415926535897932`.

> Note: These keywords are only usable within a calculation, such as `calc(pow(e, pi) - pi)`, or `min(pi, 5, e)`. If used outside of a calculation, they're treated like any other keyword: `animation-name: pi`; refers to an animation named "pi"; `line-height: e`; is invalid (not similar to `line-height: 2.7`, but `line-height: calc(e);` is).

When a calculation or a subtree of a calculation becomes infinite or NaN, representing it with a numeric value is no longer possible. To aid in serialization of these degenerate values, the additional math constants `infinity` (with the value `+∞`), `-infinity` (with the value `−∞`), and `NaN` (with the value `NaN`) are defined.

As usual for CSS keywords, these are ASCII case-insensitive. Thus, `calc(InFiNiTy)` is perfectly valid. However, `NaN` must be serialized with this canonical casing.

> Note: While not technically numbers, these keywords act as numeric values, similar to `e` and `pi`. Thus to get an infinite length, for example, requires an expression like `calc(infinity * 1px)`.

## Syntax

The syntax of `<calc-constant>` extends the syntax of {{CSSxRef("&lt;calc-value&gt;")}}.

## Examples

### Valid numbers

```plain example-good
e
-e
pi
-pi
infinity
-infinity
InFiNiTy
NaN
```

### Invalid numbers

```plain example-bad
nan
NAN
```
