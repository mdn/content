{{CSSRef}}

The **`text-decoration-thickness`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) property sets the stroke thickness of the decoration line that is used on text in an element, such as a line-through, underline, or overline.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/css/text-decoration-thickness.html")}}

## Syntax

```css
/* Single keyword */
text-decoration-thickness: auto;
text-decoration-thickness: from-font;

/* length */
text-decoration-thickness: 0.1em;
text-decoration-thickness: 3px;

/* percentage */
text-decoration-thickness: 10%;

/* Global values */
text-decoration-thickness: inherit;
text-decoration-thickness: initial;
text-decoration-thickness: revert;
text-decoration-thickness: revert-layer;
text-decoration-thickness: unset;
```

### Values

- `auto`
  - : The browser chooses an appropriate width for the text decoration line.
- `from-font`
  - : If the font file includes information about a preferred thickness, use that value. If the font file doesn't include this information, behave as if `auto` was set, with the browser choosing an appropriate thickness.
- `<length>`
  - : Specifies the thickness of the text decoration line as a {{cssxref('length')}}, overriding the font file suggestion or the browser default.
- `<percentage>`
  - : Specifies the thickness of the text decoration line as a {{cssxref('percentage')}} of **1em** in the current font. A percentage inherits as a relative value, and so therefore scales with changes in the font. The browser must use a minimum of 1 device pixel. For a given application of this property, the thickness is constant across the whole box it is applied to, even if there are child elements with a different font size.
