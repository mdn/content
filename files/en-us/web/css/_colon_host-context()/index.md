{{CSSRef}}

The **`:host-context()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [pseudo-class](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes) function selects the shadow host of the [shadow DOM](/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_shadow_DOM) containing the CSS it is used inside (so you can select a custom element from inside its shadow DOM) — but only if the selector given as the function's parameter matches the shadow host's ancestor(s) in the place it sits inside the DOM hierarchy.

In other words, this allows a custom element, or anything within that custom element's shadow DOM, to apply different styles based on its position within the outer DOM or classes/attributes applied to ancestor elements.

One typical use of this is with a descendant selector expression — for example `h1` — to select only instances of the custom element that are inside an `<h1>`.  Another typical use would be to allow inner elements to react to classes or attributes on any ancestor elements - for example, applying a different text color when a `.dark-theme` class is applied to `<body>`.

> **Note:** This has no effect when used outside a shadow DOM.

```css
/* Selects a shadow root host, only if it is
   a descendant of the selector argument given */
:host-context(h1) {
  font-weight: bold;
}

:host-context(main article) {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* Changes paragraph text color from black to white when
   a .dark-theme class is applied to the document body */
p {
  color: #000;
}

:host-context(body.dark-theme) p {
  color: #fff;
}
```

## Examples

### Selectively styling shadow hosts

The following snippets are taken from our [host-selectors example](https://github.com/mdn/web-components-examples/tree/master/host-selectors) ([see it live also](https://mdn.github.io/web-components-examples/host-selectors/)).

In this example we have a simple custom element — `<context-span>` — that you can wrap around text:

```html
<h1>Host selectors <a href="#"><context-span>example</context-span></a></h1>
```

Inside the element's constructor, we create `style` and `span` elements, fill the `span` with the content of the custom element, and fill the `style` element with some CSS rules:

```js
let style = document.createElement('style');
let span = document.createElement('span');
span.textContent = this.textContent;

const shadowRoot = this.attachShadow({mode: 'open'});
shadowRoot.appendChild(style);
shadowRoot.appendChild(span);

style.textContent = 'span:hover { text-decoration: underline; }' +
                    ':host-context(h1) { font-style: italic; }' +
                    ':host-context(h1):after { content: " - no links in headers!" }' +
                    ':host-context(article, aside) { color: gray; }' +
                    ':host(.footer) { color : red; }' +
                    ':host { background: rgba(0,0,0,0.1); padding: 2px 5px; }';
```

The `:host-context(h1) { font-style: italic; }` and `:host-context(h1):after { content: " - no links in headers!" }` rules style the instance of the `<context-span>` element (the shadow host in this instance) inside the `<h1>`. We've used it to make it clear that the custom element shouldn't appear inside the `<h1>` in our design.
