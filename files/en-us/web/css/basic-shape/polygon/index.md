{{CSSRef}}

The **`polygon()`** [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) function is one of the {{cssxref("&lt;basic-shape&gt;")}} [data types](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Types). It's used to draw a [polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygon) by providing one or more pairs of coordinates, each of which represents a vertex of the shape.

## Syntax

```css-nolint

/* Specified as coordinate list */
/* polygon(<length-percentage> <length-percentage>, ... )*/
polygon(50% 2.4%, 34.5% 33.8%, 0% 38.8%, 25% 63.1%, 19.1% 97.6%)
polygon(0px 0px, 200px 100px, 0px 200px)
polygon(0% 0px, 100% 100px, 0px 100%)
polygon(0 0, 50% 1rem, 100% 2vw, calc(100% - 20px) 100%, 0 100%)

/* Specified as coordinate list and fill rule*/
/* polygon(<fill-rule> <length-percentage> <length-percentage>, ... )*/
polygon(nonzero, 0% 0%, 50% 50%, 0% 100%)
polygon(evenodd, 0% 0%, 50% 50%, 0% 100%)
```

### Parameters

- [`<fill-rule>`](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/fill-rule) {{optional_inline}}
  - : An optional value of `nonzero` (the default when omitted) or `evenodd`, which specifies the filling rule.
- {{cssxref("length-percentage")}}
  - : Each vertex of the polygon is represented with a pair of `<length-percentage>` values, which give the coordinates of the vertex relative to the shape's [reference box](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_shapes/Basic_shapes#the_reference_box).

### Return value

Returns a {{cssxref("basic-shape")}} value.

## Formal syntax

## Examples

### Setting a polygon for shape-outside

In this example a shape is created for text to follow using the {{cssxref("shape-outside")}} property.

```html
<div class="box">
  <div class="shape"></div>
  <p>
    One November night in the year 1782, so the story runs, two brothers sat
    over their winter fire in the little French town of Annonay, watching the
    grey smoke-wreaths from the hearth curl up the wide chimney. Their names
    were Stephen and Joseph Montgolfier, they were papermakers by trade, and
    were noted as possessing thoughtful minds and a deep interest in all
    scientific knowledge and new discovery. Before that night—a memorable night,
    as it was to prove—hundreds of millions of people had watched the rising
    smoke-wreaths of their fires without drawing any special inspiration from
    the fact.
  </p>
</div>
```

```css
.box {
  width: 250px;
}

.shape {
  float: left;
  shape-outside: polygon(
    0 5%,
    15% 12%,
    30% 15%,
    40% 26%,
    45% 35%,
    45% 45%,
    40% 55%,
    10% 90%,
    10% 98%,
    8% 100%,
    0 100%
  );
  width: 300px;
  height: 320px;
}

p {
  font-size: 0.9rem;
}
```
