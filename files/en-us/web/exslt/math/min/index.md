`math:min()` returns the minimum value of a node-set.

To compute the minimum value of the node-set, the node set is sorted into ascending order as it would be using [`xsl:sort()`](/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT/Element/sort) with a data type of `number`. The minimum value is then the first node in the sorted list, converted into a number.

## Syntax

```
math:min(nodeSet)
```

### Parameters

- `nodeSet`
  - : The node-set whose lowest value is to be returned.

### Returns

A result tree fragment representing the lowest valued node's numeric value as a string.
