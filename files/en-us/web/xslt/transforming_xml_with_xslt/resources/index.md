- [XSL Results Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5023) (presently awaiting review) - allows one to experiment with XSL, by applying XSL stylesheets (which are manually entered, found via a URL or on the file-system) to an XML document (the currently-loaded document or a manually entered/pasted one).
