{{ XsltRef() }}

The `<xsl:variable>` element declares a global or local variable in a stylesheet and gives it a value. Because XSLT permits no side-effects, once the value of the variable has been established, it remains the same until the variable goes out of scope

### Syntax

    <xsl:variable name=NAME select=EXPRESSION >
    	TEMPLATE
    </xsl:variable>

### Required Attributes

- `name`
  - : Gives the variable a name.

### Optional Attributes

- `select`
  - : Defines the value of the variable through an XPath expression. If the element contains a template, this attribute is ignored.

### Type

Top-level or instruction. If it occurs as a top-level element, the variable is global in scope, and can be accessed throughout the document. If it occurs within a template, the variable is local in scope, accessible only within the template in which it appears.

### Defined

XSLT, section 11.

### Gecko support

Supported.
