The `<xsl:import>` element is a top-level element that serves to import the contents of one stylesheet into another stylesheet. Generally speaking, the contents of the imported stylesheet have a lower import precedence than that of the importing stylesheet. This is in contrast to `<xsl:include>` where the contents of the included stylesheet have exactly the same precedence as the contents of the including stylesheet.

### Syntax

    <xsl:import href=URI  />

### Required Attributes

- `href`
  - : Specifies the URI of the stylesheet to import.

### Optional Attributes

None.

### Type

Top-level, must appear before any other child of `<xsl:stylesheet>` or `<xsl:transform>` in the importing stylesheet.

### Defined

XSLT, section 2.6.2.

### Gecko support

Mostly supported with a few issues with top level variables and parameters as of Mozilla 1.0.
