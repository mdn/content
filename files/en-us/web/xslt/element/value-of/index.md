{{ XsltRef() }}

The `<xsl:value-of>` element evaluates an XPath expression, converts it to a string, and writes that string to the result tree.

### Syntax

    <xsl:value-of select=EXPRESSION disable-output-escaping="yes" | "no"  />

### Required Attributes

- `select`
  - : Specifies the XPath expression to be evaluated and written to the output tree.

### Optional Attributes

- `disable-output-escaping` (Netscape does not serialize the result of transformation - the "output" below - so this attribute is essentially irrelevant in context. To output html-entities, use numerical values instead, eg `&#160` for `&nbsp`)
  - : Specifies whether special characters are escaped when written to the output. The available values are "`yes`" or "`no`". If "`yes`" is set, for example, the character > is output as `>`, not as "`&gt`".

### Type

Instruction, appears with a template.

### Defined

XSLT, section 7.6.1.

### Gecko support

Supported except as above.
