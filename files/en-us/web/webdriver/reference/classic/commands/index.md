WebDriver classic commands are sent as HTTP requests to specific endpoints on the remote end.
Commands are used to control the behavior of a user agent, discover and manipulate DOM elements, and manage browser windows and sessions.

When a WebDriver client sends a command, it specifies the HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`) and endpoint path that corresponds to the desired operation.
The remote end processes the command and returns an HTTP response containing the result or an error.
