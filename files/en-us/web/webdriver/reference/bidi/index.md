WebDriver BiDi is a bidirectional protocol for browser automation that provides event-driven communication between the local and remote ends.
Unlike the HTTP request-response model of [WebDriver classic](/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Reference/Classic), BiDi enables real-time events and supports advanced automation scenarios through WebSocket-based communication.
This reference documents the commands, capabilities, modules, events, and errors available in WebDriver BiDi.

- [Commands](/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Reference/BiDi/Commands)
  - : Asynchronous operations to inspect and control the behavior of browsers, manage browser sessions and contexts, execute scripts, monitor network activity, and interact with DOM elements.
- Capabilities
  - : Configuration options used to communicate the features supported by a session and to define which features the driver must satisfy when creating a new session.
- Modules
  - : Collections of related commands and events pertaining to specific aspects of browser automation.
- Events
  - : Notifications sent by the remote end signaling that something of interest has occurred.
- Errors
  - : Error codes that commands can return.
