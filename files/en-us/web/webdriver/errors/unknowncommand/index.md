The **unknown command** error is a [WebDriver error](/en-US/docs/Web/WebDriver/Errors) that occurs when the driver does not recognize the command/HTTP endpoint.

## Examples

The `/session/{session id}/foo` endpoint does not exist, and will return an unknown command error with a [`404 Not Found`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/404) HTTP status code:

    % curl -i -d '{}' http://localhost:4444/session/foo
    HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
    Connection: close
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Cache-Control: no-cache
    Content-Length: 113
