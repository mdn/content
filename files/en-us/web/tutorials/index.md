How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?
- [CSS first steps](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps)

- [CSS building blocks](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks)

  - : This module carries on where [CSS first steps](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps) left off — now you've gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.

    The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like [text styling](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text) and [CSS layout](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout).

Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the viewport, and one another. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, traditional layout methods involving float and positioning, and new fangled layout tools like flexbox.

After that, we discuss some key JavaScript features in detail, such as variables, strings, numbers and arrays.
- [JavaScript building blocks](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks)
  - : In this module, we continue our coverage of all JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events.

### Intermediate level

- [Introducing JavaScript objects](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects)
  - : In JavaScript, most things are objects, from core JavaScript features like strings and arrays to the browser APIs built on top of JavaScript. You can even create your own objects to encapsulate related functions and variables into efficient packages. The object-oriented nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with your knowledge of the language and write more efficient code, therefore we've provided this module to help you. Here we teach object theory and syntax in detail, look at how to create your own objects, and explain what JSON data is and how to work with it.
- [Client-side web APIs](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs)
  - : When writing client-side JavaScript for websites or applications, you won't go very far before you start to use APIs — interfaces for manipulating different aspects of the browser and operating system the site is running on, or even data from other websites or services. In this module, we will explore what APIs are, and how to use some of the most common APIs you'll come across often in your development work.
