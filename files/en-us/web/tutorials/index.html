 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics">CSS basics</a></dt>
 <dd>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code you use to style your webpage. <em>CSS Basics</em> takes you through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make my text black or red? How do I make my content show up in such-and-such a place on the screen? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps">CSS first steps</a></dt>
 <dd>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and lay out web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.</dd>

 <p class="summary">This module carries on where <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps">CSS first steps</a> left off — now you've gained familiarity with the language and its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, its time to dive a bit deeper. This module looks at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling backgrounds and borders, debugging, and lots more.</p>

 <p class="summary">The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text">text styling</a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout">CSS layout</a>.</p>

 <dd>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right place in relation to the viewport, and one another. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so can now dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, traditional layout methods involving float and positioning, and new fangled layout tools like flexbox.</dd>

 <dd>In our first JavaScript module, we first answer some fundamental questions such as "what is JavaScript?", "what does it look like?", and "what can it do?", before moving on to taking you through your first practical experience of writing JavaScript. After that, we discuss some key JavaScript features in detail, such as variables, strings, numbers and arrays.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks">JavaScript building blocks</a></dt>
 <dd>In this module, we continue our coverage of all JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code block such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events. You've seen this stuff already in the course, but only in passing — here we'll discuss it all explicitly.</dd>

<dl>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects">Introducing JavaScript objects</a></dt>
 <dd>In JavaScript, most things are objects, from core JavaScript features like strings and arrays to the browser APIs built on top of JavaScript. You can even create your own objects to encapsulate related functions and variables into efficient packages. The object-oriented nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with your knowledge of the language and write more efficient code, therefore we've provided this module to help you. Here we teach object theory and syntax in detail, look at how to create your own objects, and explain what JSON data is and how to work with it.</dd>
 <dt><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs">Client-side web APIs</a></dt>
 <dd>When writing client-side JavaScript for websites or applications, you won't go very far before you start to use APIs — interfaces for manipulating different aspects of the browser and operating system the site is running on, or even data from other websites or services. In this module, we will explore what APIs are, and how to use some of the most common APIs you'll come across often in your development work. </dd>
