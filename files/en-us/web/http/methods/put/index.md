The **HTTP `PUT` request method** creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the target resource with the request payload.

The difference between `PUT` and {{HTTPMethod("POST")}} is that `PUT` is idempotent: calling it once or several times successively has the same effect (that is no _side_ effect), whereas successive identical {{HTTPMethod("POST")}} requests may have additional effects, akin to placing an order several times.

## Syntax

```
PUT /new.html HTTP/1.1
```

## Example

### Request

```
PUT /new.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-type: text/html
Content-length: 16

<p>New File</p>
```

### Responses

If the target resource does not have a current representation and the `PUT` request successfully creates one, then the origin server must inform the user agent by sending a {{HTTPStatus("201")}} (`Created`) response.

    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Content-Location: /new.html

If the target resource does have a current representation and that representation is successfully modified in accordance with the state of the enclosed representation, then the origin server must send either a {{HTTPStatus("200")}} (`OK`) or a {{HTTPStatus("204")}} (`No Content`) response to indicate successful completion of the request.

    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Content-Location: /existing.html
