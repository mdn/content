The **HTTP `GET` method** requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using `GET` should only be used to request data (they shouldn't include data).

> **Note:** Sending body/payload in a `GET` request may cause some existing implementations to reject the request â€” while not prohibited by the specification, the semantics are undefined. It is better to just avoid sending payloads in `GET` requests.
