The **HTTP `CONNECT` method** starts two-way communications
with the requested resource. It can be used to open a tunnel.

For example, the `CONNECT` method can be used to access websites that use
{{Glossary("SSL")}} ({{Glossary("HTTPS")}}). The client asks an HTTP {{Glossary("Proxy
  server")}} to tunnel the [TCP](/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP) connection to
the desired destination. The server then proceeds to make the connection on behalf of
the client. Once the connection has been established by the server, the
{{Glossary("Proxy server")}} continues to proxy the TCP stream to and
from the client.

`CONNECT` is a hop-by-hop method.
