{{HTTPSidebar}}

The **`PATCH`** HTTP method applies partial modifications to a resource.

`PATCH` is somewhat analogous to the "update" concept found in {{Glossary("CRUD")}} (in general, HTTP is different than {{Glossary("CRUD")}}, and the two should not be confused).

In comparison with {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}}, a `PATCH` serves as a set of instructions for modifying a resource, whereas `PUT` represents a complete replacement of the resource.
A `PUT` request is always {{Glossary("idempotent")}} (repeating the same request multiple times results in the resource remaining in the same state), whereas a `PATCH` request may not always be idempotent.
For instance, if a resource includes an auto-incrementing counter, a `PUT` request will overwrite the counter (since it replaces the entire resource), but a `PATCH` request may not.

Like {{HTTPMethod("POST")}}, a `PATCH` request can potentially have side effects on other resources.

A server can advertise support for `PATCH` by adding it to the list in the {{HTTPHeader("Allow")}} or {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods")}} (for [CORS](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)) response headers.
Another implicit indication that `PATCH` is supported is the {{HTTPHeader("Accept-Patch")}} header (usually after an {{HTTPMethod("OPTIONS")}} request on a resource), which lists the media-types the server is able to understand in a `PATCH` request for a resource.

<table class="properties">

    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Request has body</th>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Successful response has body</th>
      <td>May</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">{{Glossary("Safe/HTTP", "Safe")}}</th>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">{{Glossary("Idempotent")}}</th>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">{{Glossary("Cacheable")}}</th>
      <td>Only if freshness information is included</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">
        Allowed in <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms">HTML forms</a>
      </th>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

## Syntax

```http
PATCH <request-target>["?"<query>] HTTP/1.1
```

- `<request-target>`
  - : Identifies the target resource of the request when combined with the information provided in the {{HTTPHeader("Host")}} header.
    This is an absolute path (e.g., `/path/to/file.html`) in requests to an origin server, and an absolute URL in requests to proxies (e.g., `http://www.example.com/path/to/file.html`).
- `<query>` {{optional_inline}}
  - : An optional query component preceded by a question-mark `?`.
    Often used to carry identifying information in the form of `key=value` pairs.

## Examples

### Successfully modifying a resource

Assume there is a resource on the server representing a user with a numeric ID of `123` in the following format:

```json
{
  "firstName": "Example",
  "LastName": "User",
  "userId": 123,
  "signupDate": "2024-09-09T21:48:58Z",
  "status": "active",
  "registeredDevice": {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "personal",
    "manufacturer": {
      "name": "Hardware corp"
    }
  }
}
```

Instead of sending a JSON object to fully overwrite a resource, a `PATCH` modifies only specific parts of the resource.
This request updates the `status` field:

```http
PATCH /users/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 27
Authorization: Bearer ABC123

{
  "status": "suspended"
}
```

The interpretation and authentication of the `PATCH` request depend on the implementation.
Success can be indicated by any of the [successful response status codes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#successful_responses).
In this example, a {{HTTPStatus("204", "204 No Content")}} is used as there's no need to transmit a body with additional context about the operation.
An {{HTTPHeader("ETag")}} is provided so the caller can perform a [conditional request](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests) in future:

```http
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Location: /users/123
ETag: "e0023aa4f"
```
