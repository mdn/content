The **HTTP `PATCH` request method** applies partial modifications to a resource.

`PATCH` is somewhat analogous to the "update" concept found in {{Glossary("CRUD")}} (in general, HTTP is different than {{Glossary("CRUD")}}, and the two should not be confused).

A `PATCH` request is considered a set of instructions on how to modify a resource. Contrast this with {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}}; which is a complete representation of a resource.

A `PATCH` is not necessarily idempotent, although it can be. Contrast this with {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}}; which is always idempotent. The word "idempotent" means that any number of repeated, identical requests will leave the resource in the same state. For example if an auto-incrementing counter field is an integral part of the resource, then a {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}} will naturally overwrite it (since it overwrites everything), but not necessarily so for `PATCH`.

`PATCH` (like {{HTTPMethod("POST")}}) _may_ have side-effects on other resources.

To find out whether a server supports `PATCH`, a server can advertise its support by adding it to the list in the {{HTTPHeader("Allow")}} or {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods")}} (for [CORS](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)) response headers.

Another (implicit) indication that `PATCH` is allowed, is the presence of the {{HTTPHeader("Accept-Patch")}} header, which specifies the patch document formats accepted by the server.

## Syntax

```
PATCH /file.txt HTTP/1.1
```

## Example

### Request

```
PATCH /file.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Content-Type: application/example
If-Match: "e0023aa4e"
Content-Length: 100

[description of changes]
```

### Response

A successful response is indicated by any [2xx](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-6.3) status code.

In the example below a {{HTTPStatus("204")}} response code is used, because the response does not carry a payload body. A {{HTTPStatus("200")}} response could have contained a payload body.

```
HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
Content-Location: /file.txt
ETag: "e0023aa4f"
```
