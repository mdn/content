### Responses

If a `DELETE` method is successfully applied, there are several response
status codes possible:

- A {{HTTPStatus("202")}} (`Accepted`) status code if the action will
  likely succeed but has not yet been enacted.
- A {{HTTPStatus("204")}} (`No Content`) status code if the action has been
  enacted and no further information is to be supplied.
- A {{HTTPStatus("200")}} (`OK`) status code if the action has been enacted
  and the response message includes a representation describing the status.
