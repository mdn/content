The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)Â  **`510 Not Extended`**
response status code is sent in the context of the HTTP Extension Framework, defined in
[RFC 2774](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2774).

In that specification a client may send a request that contains an extension
declaration, that describes the extension to be used. If the server receives such a
request, but any described extensions are not supported for the request, then the server
responds with the 510 status code.
