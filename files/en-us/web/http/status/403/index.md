The HTTP **`403 Forbidden`** response status code indicates that the server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.

This status is similar to {{HTTPStatus("401")}}, but for the **`403 Forbidden`** status code, re-authenticating makes no difference. The access is tied to the application logic, such as insufficient rights to a resource.
