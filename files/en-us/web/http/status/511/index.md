The HTTP **`511 Network Authentication Required`** [server error response](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#server_error_responses) status code indicates that the client needs to authenticate to gain network access.
This status is not generated by origin servers, but by intercepting {{Glossary("Proxy_server", "proxies")}} that control access to a network.

Network operators sometimes require some authentication, acceptance of terms, or other user interaction before granting access (for example in an internet caf√© or at an airport).
They often identify clients who have not done so using their Media Access Control (MAC) addresses.

## Status

```http
511 Network Authentication Required
```

## Examples

### 511 response for a GET request

In the following example, a client tries to access a resource on a network.
The request is not authenticated, and a proxy sends a `511` status code to prompt the visitor to log in.
The `511` ensures that non-browser clients will not interpret the response as being from the origin server.
Browsers are redirected automatically via the {{HTMLelement("meta")}} tag after 10 seconds, or by clicking the link in the response body:

```http
GET /document HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

```http
