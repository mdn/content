<p>The HTTP <strong><code>201 Created</code></strong> success status response code
  indicates that the request has succeeded and has led to the creation of a resource. The
  new resource is effectively created before this response is sent backÂ and the new
  resource is returned in the body of the message, its location being either the URL of
  the request, or the content of the {{HTTPHeader("Location")}} header.</p>

<p>The common use case of this status code is as the result of a {{HTTPMethod("POST")}}
  request.</p>
