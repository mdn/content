The HTTP **`100 Continue`** informational status response code
indicates that everything so far is OK and that the client should continue with the
request or ignore it if it is already finished.

To have a server check the request's headers, a client must send
{{HTTPHeader("Expect")}}`: 100-continue` as a header in its initial request
and receive a `100 Continue` status code in response before sending the body.
