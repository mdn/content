The HTTP **`414 URI Too Long`** response status code indicates
that the URI requested by the client is longer than the server is willing to interpret.

There are a few rare conditions when this might occur:

- when a client has improperly converted a {{HTTPMethod("POST")}} request to a
  {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} request with long query information,
- when the client has descended into a loop of redirection (for example, a redirected
  URI prefix that points to a suffix of itself),
- or when the server is under attack by a client attempting to exploit potential
  security holes.
