The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) **`303 See Other`**
redirect status response code indicates that the redirects don't link to the requested resource itself, but to another page (such as a confirmation page, a representation of a real-world object — see [HTTP range-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPRange-14) — or an upload-progress page). This response code is often sent back as a result of
{{HTTPMethod("PUT")}} or {{HTTPMethod("POST")}}. The method used to display this
redirected page is always {{HTTPMethod("GET")}}.
