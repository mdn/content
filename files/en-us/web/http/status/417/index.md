The HTTP **`417 Expectation Failed`** [client error response](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the expectation given in the request's {{HTTPHeader("Expect")}} header could not be met.
After receiving a 417 response, a client should repeat the request without an `Expect` request header, including the file in the request body without waiting for a {{HTTPStatus("100")}} response.
See the {{HTTPHeader("Expect")}} header documentation for more details.

## Status

```http
417 Expectation Failed
```

## Examples

### Expectations unsupported

The following PUT request sends information about an intended file upload to a server.
The client uses an `Expect: 100-continue` header and no request body to avoid sending data over the network that may result in an error such as {{HTTPStatus("405")}}, {{HTTPStatus("401")}}, or {{HTTPStatus("403")}} response:

```http
PUT /videos HTTP/1.1
Host: uploads.example.com
Content-Type: video/h264
Content-Length: 1234567890987
Expect: 100-continue
```

In this example server implementation, expectations are not supported and the presence of an `Expect` header with any value results in 417 responses:

```http
HTTP/1.1 417 Expectation Failed
Date: Fri, 28 Jun 2024 11:40:58 GMT
```

The client responds by making a request without expectations and with the {{Glossary("HTTP Content", "content")}} in the request body:

```http
PUT /videos HTTP/1.1
Host: uploads.example.com
Content-Type: video/h264
Content-Length: 1234567890987

[â€¦]
```
