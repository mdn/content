<p>The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) <code><strong>503 Service Unavailable</strong></code> server error response code indicates that the server is not ready to handle the request.</p>

<p>Common causes are a server that is down for maintenance or that is overloaded. This response should be used for temporary conditions and the {{HTTPHeader("Retry-After")}} HTTP header should, if possible, contain the estimated time for the recovery of the service.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> together with this response, a user-friendly page explaining the problem should be sent.</p>
</div>

<p>Caching-related headers that are sent along with this response should be taken care of, as a 503 status is often a temporary condition and responses shouldn't usually be cached.</p>
