<p><span class="seoSummary">The HTTP
    <code><strong>431 Request Header Fields Too Large</strong></code> response status code
    indicates that the server refuses to process the request because the request’s <a
      href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers">HTTP headers</a> are too long.</span> The
  request <em>may</em> be resubmitted after reducing the size of the request headers.</p>

<p>431 can be used when the <strong>total size</strong> of request headers is too large,
  or when a <strong>single</strong> header field is too large. To help those running into
  this error, indicate which of the two is the problem in the response body — ideally,
  also include which headers are too large. This lets users attempt to fix the problem,
  such as by clearing their cookies.</p>

<p>Servers will often produce this status if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The {{ httpheader("Referer") }} URL is too long</li>
  <li>There are too many <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies">Cookies</a> sent in the
    request</li>
</ul>
