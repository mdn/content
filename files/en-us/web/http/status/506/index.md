The HTTP **`506 Variant Also Negotiates`** [server error response](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#server_error_responses) status code is returned during Transparent Content Negotiation (TCN) when there is recursive loop in the process of selecting a resource.

Transparent Content Negotiation enables a client and server to collaboratively decide the best variant of a given resource when the server has multiple variants.
A server sends a `506` status code due to server misconfiguration that results in circular references when creating responses.

Transparent Content Negotiation is not supported in most modern browsers due to complexity in implementations, lack of standardization of how clients automatically choose from responses, and the additional round-trips that slow down client-server interaction.
[Server-driven content negotiation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation#server-driven_content_negotiation) is far more common, where a server directly chooses the most appropriate resource for the client based on the request headers ({{HTTPHeader("Accept-Language")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Accept")}}, etc.).

## Examples

### Resource with variants

In the following example, a client requests a page in the `fr` locale using the {{HTTPHeader("Accept-Language")}} header.
This can be performed using curl:

```bash
curl  -H "Negotiate: trans" -H "Accept-Language: fr;" http://example.com/index
```

This produces the following request:

```http
GET /index HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
Accept: */*
Negotiate: trans
Accept-Language: fr
```

Due to server misconfiguration, the variant response for `fr` points to a [type map](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_negotiation.html#typemaps) which itself causes transparent negotiation to be performed.
The server may detect this condition by the presence of a `TCN` header in a choice response before it is sent:

```http
