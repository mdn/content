The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) **`506 Variant Also Negotiates`** response status code may be given in the context of Transparent Content Negotiation (see [RFC 2295](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2295)). This protocol enables a client to retrieve the best variant of a given resource, where the server supports multiple variants.

The **`Variant Also Negotiates`** status code indicates an internal server configuration error in which the chosen variant is itself configured to engage in content negotiation, so is not a proper negotiation endpoint.
