{{HTTPSidebar}}

The HTTP **`415 Unsupported Media Type`** [client error response](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the server refused to accept the request because the payload format is not supported.

The format problem might be due to the request's indicated {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} or {{HTTPHeader("Content-Encoding")}}, or as a result of processing the request payload.
Some servers may be strict about the expected `Content-Type` of requests.
For example, sending `UTF8` instead of `UTF-8` to specify the {{glossary("UTF-8")}} charset may cause the server to consider the media type invalid.

## Status

```http
415 Unsupported Media Type
```

## Examples

### Missing content type

In the following example, the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} header is missing entirely:

```http
POST /comments HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 23

{
  "user": "belgin",
  "comment": "LGTM!"
}
```

If the server implementation expects at least a MIME type `Content-Type: application/json;` for the request at that endpoint, it may send the following response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
Date: Fri, 28 Jun 2024 12:00:00 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Accept: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 0
```

### Invalid content type

In the following example, the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} header is incorrectly set to URL-encoded form data when the payload is in the request body instead:

```http
POST /comments HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Length: 23
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

{
  "user": "belgin",
  "comment": "LGTM!"
}
```

In this case, the server responds with a 415, with the required content type for the request in the {{HTTPHeader("Accept")}} header:

```http
HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
Date: Fri, 28 Jun 2024 12:00:00 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Accept: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 0
```
