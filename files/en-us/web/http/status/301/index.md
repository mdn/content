{{HTTPSidebar}}

The HTTP **`301 Moved Permanently`** [redirection response](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#redirection_messages) status code indicates that the requested resource has been permanently moved to the URL in the {{HTTPHeader("Location")}} header.

A browser receiving this status will automatically request the resource at the URL in the `Location` header, redirecting the user to the new page.
Search engines receiving this response will attribute links to the original URL to the redirected resource, passing the {{Glossary("SEO")}} ranking to the new URL.

> [!NOTE]
> Although the [specification](#specifications) requires the request method and the body to remain unchanged when redirection is performed, not all user-agents meet this requirement.
> Use the `301` code only as a response for {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} or {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}} methods and use the {{HTTPStatus("308", "308 Permanent Redirect")}} for other methods (typically {{HTTPMethod("POST")}}), as altering the method when handling `308` responses is explicitly prohibited.

## Status

```http
301 Moved Permanently
```

## Examples

### 301 response to a moved resource

The following {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} request is made to a resource with a `301` redirection in place.

```http
GET /en-US/docs/AJAX HTTP/2
Host: developer.mozilla.org
User-Agent: curl/8.6.0
Accept: */*
```

The response includes the `301` status along with the {{HTTPHeader("Location")}} header that indicates the URL where the resource has moved.

```http
