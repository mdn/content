{{HTTPSidebar}}

The HTTP **`301 Moved Permanently`** [redirection response](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#redirection_messages) status code indicates that the requested resource has been permanently moved to the URL in the {{HTTPHeader("Location")}} header.

A browser receiving this status will automatically request the resource at the URL in the `Location` header, redirecting the user to the new page.
Search engines receiving this response will attribute links to the original URL to the redirected resource, passing the {{Glossary("SEO")}} ranking to the new URL.

> [!NOTE]
> In the [Fetch Standard](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-redirect-fetch), when a user agent receives a `301` in response to a {{HTTPMethod("POST")}} request, it uses the {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} method in the subsequent redirection request, as permitted by the HTTP [specification](#specifications).
> To avoid user agents modifying the request, use {{HTTPStatus("308", "308 Permanent Redirect")}} instead, as altering the method after a `308` response is prohibited.

## Status
