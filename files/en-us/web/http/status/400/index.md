The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) **`400 Bad Request`** response status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (for example, malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

> **Warning:** The client should not repeat this request without modification.
