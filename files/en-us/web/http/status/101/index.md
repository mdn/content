The HTTPÂ **`101 Switching Protocols`** response code indicates
a protocol to which the server switches. 
The protocol is specified in the {{HTTPHeader("Upgrade")}} request header received from a client.

The server includes in this response an {{HTTPHeader("Upgrade")}} response header to
indicate the protocol it switched to. The process is described in the following article:
[Protocol upgrade
mechanism](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Protocol_upgrade_mechanism).
