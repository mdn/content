The HTTP **`203 Non-Authoritative Information`** response
status indicates that the request was successful but the enclosed payload has been
modified by a transforming {{Glossary("Proxy server", "proxy")}} from that of the origin
server's {{HTTPStatus("200")}} (`OK`) response.

The `203` response is similar to the value
[`214`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Warning#warning_codes),
meaning `Transformation Applied`, of the {{HTTPHeader("Warning")}} header
code, which has the additional advantage of being applicable to responses with any
status code.
