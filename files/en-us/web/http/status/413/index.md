The HTTP **`413 Content Too Large`** response status code indicates that the request entity is larger than limits defined by server; the server might close the connection or return a {{HTTPHeader("Retry-After")}} header field.

Prior to RFC 9110 the response phrase for the status was **`Payload Too Large`**. That name is still widely used.
