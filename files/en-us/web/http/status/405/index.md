The HTTP **`405 Method Not Allowed`** [client error response](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the server knows the request method, but the target resource doesn't support this method.
The server **must** generate an {{HTTPHeader("Allow")}} header in a 405 response with a list of methods that the target resource currently supports.

Improper server-side permissions set on files or directories may cause a 405 response when the request would otherwise be expected to succeed.

## Status

```http
405 Method Not Allowed
```

## Examples

### TRACE method not allowed

Server owners often disallow the use of the `TRACE` method due to security concerns.
The following example shows a typical response where a server doesn't allow the use of `TRACE`:

```http
TRACE / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
Content-Length: 0
Date: Fri, 28 Jun 2024 14:30:31 GMT
Server: ECLF (nyd/D179)
Allow: GET, POST, HEAD
```
