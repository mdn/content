The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) **`405 Method Not Allowed`** response status code indicates that the server knows the request method, but the target resource doesn't support this method.

The server **must** generate an **`Allow`** header field in a 405 status code response. The field must contain a list of methods that the target resource currently supports.
