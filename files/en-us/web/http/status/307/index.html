<p>{{Glossary("HTTP")}} <code><strong>307 Temporary Redirect</strong></code> redirect
  status response code indicates that the resource requested has been temporarily moved to
  the URL given by the {{HTTPHeader("Location")}} headers.</p>

<p>The method and the body of the original request are reused to perform the redirected
  request. In the cases where you want the method used to be changed to
  {{HTTPMethod("GET")}}, use {{HTTPStatus("303", "303 See Other")}} instead. This is
  useful when you want to give an answer to a {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}} method that is not the
  uploaded resources, but a confirmation message (like "You successfully uploaded XYZ").
</p>

<p>The only difference between <code>307</code> and {{HTTPStatus("302")}} is that
  <code>307</code> guarantees that the method and the body will not be changed when the
  redirected request is made. With <code>302</code>, some old clients were incorrectly
  changing the method to {{HTTPMethod("GET")}}: the behavior with non-<code>GET</code>
  methods and <code>302</code> is then unpredictable on the Web, whereas the behavior with
  <code>307</code> is predictable. For <code>GET</code> requests, their behavior is
  identical.</p>
