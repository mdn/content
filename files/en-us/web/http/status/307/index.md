{{Glossary("HTTP")}} **`307 Temporary Redirect`** redirect
status response code indicates that the resource requested has been temporarily moved to
the URL given by the {{HTTPHeader("Location")}} headers.

The method and the body of the original request are reused to perform the redirected
request. In the cases where you want the method used to be changed to
{{HTTPMethod("GET")}}, use {{HTTPStatus("303", "303 See Other")}} instead. This is
useful when you want to give an answer to a {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}} method that is not the
uploaded resources, but a confirmation message (like "You successfully uploaded XYZ").

The only difference between `307` and {{HTTPStatus("302")}} is that
`307` guarantees that the method and the body will not be changed when the
redirected request is made. With `302`, some old clients were incorrectly
changing the method to {{HTTPMethod("GET")}}: the behavior with non-`GET`
methods and `302` is then unpredictable on the Web, whereas the behavior with
`307` is predictable. For `GET` requests, their behavior is
identical.
