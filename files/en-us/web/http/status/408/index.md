The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
**`408 Request Timeout`** response status codeÂ means that the
server would like to shut down this unused connection. It is sent on an idle connection
by some servers, _even without any previous request by the client_.

A server should send the "close" {{HTTPHeader("Connection")}} header field in the
response, since `408` implies that the server has decided to close the
connection rather than continue waiting.

This response is used much more since some browsers, like Chrome, Firefox 27+, and IE9,
use HTTP pre-connection mechanisms to speed up surfing.

> **Note:** some servers merely shut down the connection without sending
> this message.
