The HTTP **`508 Loop Detected`** [server error response](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#server_error_responses) status code indicates that the entire operation failed because it encountered an infinite loop while processing a request with `Depth: infinity`.

The status may be given in the context of the Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning ({{Glossary("WebDAV")}}).
It was introduced as a fallback for cases where WebDAV clients do not support {{HTTPStatus("208", "208 Already Reported")}} responses (when requests do not explicitly include a `DAV` header).
