> **Note:** The ability to _lock_ a resource is specific to some {{Glossary("WebDAV")}} servers. Browsers accessing web pages will never encounter this status code; in the erroneous cases it happens, they will handle it as a generic `400` status code.

The HTTP **`423 Locked`** error response code indicates that either the resources tentatively targeted by is _locked_, meaning it can't be accessed. Its content should contain some information in WebDAV's XML format.
