The HTTP **`409 Conflict`** response status code indicates a request conflict with the current state of the target resource.

Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}} request. For example, you may get a 409 response when uploading a file that is older than the existing one on the server, resulting in a version control conflict.
