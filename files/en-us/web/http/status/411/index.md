{{HTTPSidebar}}

The HTTP **`411 Length Required`** [client error response](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the server refused to accept the request without a defined {{HTTPHeader("Content-Length")}} header.

> [!NOTE]
> When sending data in a series of chunks, the `Content-Length` header is omitted, and at the beginning of each chunk, the length of the current chunk needs to be included in hexadecimal format.
> See {{HTTPHeader("Transfer-Encoding")}} for more details.

## Status

```http
411 Length Required
```

## Examples

### Chunked POST request

The following request is sent chunked, which is the default method of sending data in some cases, such as when [writing to streams](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#requestwritechunk-encoding-callback):

```http
POST /translate/de HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-encoding: chunked

2C
{"text": "Hurry up, Ay≈üe is hungry!"}
0
```

In this case, the server is expecting a request in one part with a {{HTTPHeader("Content-Length")}} header and returns a 411 response:

```http
HTTP/1.1 411 Length Required
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 110

{
  "message": "Requests must have a content length header.",
  "documentation": "http://api/example.com/docs/errors",
}
```
