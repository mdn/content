{{HTTPSidebar}}

The HTTP **`206 Partial Content`** [successful response](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#successful_responses) status code is sent in response to a [range request](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests).
The response body contains the requested ranges of data as specified in the {{HTTPHeader("Range")}} header of the request.

The format of the response depends on the number of ranges requested.
If a single range is requested, the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} of the entire response is set to the type of the document, and a {{HTTPHeader("Content-Range")}} is provided.
If several ranges are requested, the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} is set to `multipart/byteranges`, and each fragment covers one range, with its own {{HTTPHeader("Content-Range")}} and {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} headers describing it.
