The HTTP **`304 Not Modified`** client redirection response
code indicates that there is no need to retransmit the requested resources. It is an
implicit redirection to a cached resource. This happens when the request method is
a {{glossary("Safe/HTTP", "safe")}} method, such as {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} or {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}},
or when the request is conditional and uses an {{HTTPHeader("If-None-Match")}} or an
{{HTTPHeader("If-Modified-Since")}} header.

The equivalent {{HTTPStatus("200")}} `OK` response would have included the
headers {{HTTPHeader("Cache-Control")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Content-Location")}},
{{HTTPHeader("Date")}}, {{HTTPHeader("ETag")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Expires")}}, and
{{HTTPHeader("Vary")}}.

> **Note:** Many [developer tools' network panels](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/network_monitor/index.html)
> of browsers create extraneous requests leading to `304` responses, so that
> access to the local cache is visible to developers.
