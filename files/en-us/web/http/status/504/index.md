The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) **`504 Gateway Timeout`** server error response code indicates that the server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, did not get a response in time from the upstream server that it needed in order to complete the request.

> **Note:** A [Gateway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_(telecommunications)) might refer to different things in networking and a 504 error is usually not something you can fix, but requires a fix by the web server or the proxies you are trying to get access through.
