The HTTP **`300 Multiple Choices`** [redirection response](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#redirection_messages) status code indicates that the request has more than one possible response.
The user-agent or the user should choose one of them.

> [!NOTE]
> In Transparent Content Negotiation (TCN), a client and server collaboratively decide the best variant of a given resource when the server has multiple variants.
> Most modern browsers have poor support due to complexity in implementations, lack of standardization of how clients automatically choose from responses, and the additional round-trips that slow down client-server interaction.
> [Server-driven content negotiation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation#server-driven_content_negotiation) is far more common, where a server chooses the most appropriate resource for the client based on the request headers ({{HTTPHeader("Accept-Language")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Accept")}}, etc.).

The server should include content in the response that contains a list of resource metadata and URIs from which the user or user agent can choose.
The format of the content is implementation-specific, but should be easily parsed by the user agent (such as HTML or JSON).

If the server has a preferred choice that the client should request, it can include it in a {{HTTPHeader("Location")}} header.

## Examples

### 300 response with list of resources

The following example demonstrates a Transparent Content Negotiation request-response exchange.
An Apache server offers multiple variants of a resource defined in a [type map](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_negotiation.html#typemaps); `index.html.en` for a resource in English, and `index.html.fr` for a French version:

```plain
URI: index.html.en
Content-Language: en

URI: index.html.fr
Content-Language: fr
```

A `Negotiate: trans` request header indicates that the client wants to use TCN to choose a resource.
Poor browser support for this mechanism means a user agent such as curl must be used instead:

```bash
 curl -v -H "Negotiate: trans" http://localhost/index
```

This produces the following request:

```http
GET /index HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
Accept: */*
Negotiate: trans
```

We receive a `300` response with details of different representations of the requested resource:

```http
