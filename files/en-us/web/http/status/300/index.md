The HTTP **`300 Multiple Choices`** [redirection response](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#redirection_messages) status code indicates that the request has more than one possible response.
The user-agent or the user should choose one of them.
There is no standardized way of choosing one of the responses, so this response code is rarely used.

If the server has a preferred choice that the client should request, it should generate a {{HTTPHeader("Location")}} header.
See [Content negotiation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation) for more information.

## Examples

### 300 response with a `Location` header

The following example shows how reactive negotiation (or [agent-driven negotiation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation#agent-driven_negotiation)) may look.
In this scenario, a `300` response is sent by the server with details of different representations of the requested resource.
The browser would then choose one of the options (or defer the decision to the user), and send a new request to fetch the selected resource.
Note that in this case the server response also includes the `Location` header to indicate the resource that it would prefer to return.

```http
GET /resource HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Accept: application/json
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 300 Multiple Choices
Content-Type: application/json
Location: http://example.com/resource-html

{
  "message": "Multiple choices available.",
  "choices": [
    {
      "contentType": "text/pdf",
      "uri": "http://example.com/resource-pdf"
    },
    {
      "contentType": "text/html",
      "uri": "http://example.com/resource-html"
    }
  ]
}
```

The downsides of this approach are that the content may have a different format or syntax depending on the implementation, and that the interaction includes an additional request-response exchange â€” which slows down the interaction.
