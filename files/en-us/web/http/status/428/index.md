The HTTP **`428 Precondition Required`** response status code
indicates that the server requires the request to be [conditional](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests).

Typically, this means that a required precondition header, such
as {{HTTPHeader("If-Match")}}, **is missing**.

When a precondition header is **not matching** the server side state, the
response should be {{HTTPStatus(412)}} `Precondition Failed`.
