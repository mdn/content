<p class="summary"><strong>Content Security Policy</strong> ({{Glossary("CSP")}}) is an
  added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks,
  including Cross Site Scripting ({{Glossary("XSS")}}) and data injection attacks. These
  attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement to distribution of
  malware.</p>

<p>CSP is designed to be fully backward compatible (except CSP version 2 where there are
  some explicitly-mentioned inconsistencies in backward compatibility; more details <a
    href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP2">here</a> section 1.1). Browsers that don't support
  it still work with servers that implement it, and vice-versa: browsers that don't
  support CSP ignore it, functioning as usual, defaulting to the standard same-origin
  policy for web content. If the site doesn't offer the CSP header, browsers likewise use
  the standard <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">same-origin
    policy</a>.</p>

<p>To enable CSP, you need to configure your web server to return the
  {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}} HTTP header. (Sometimes you may see mentions
  of the <code>X-Content-Security-Policy</code> header, but that's an older version and
  you don't need to specify it anymore.)</p>

<p>Alternatively, the {{HTMLElement("meta")}} element can be used to configure a policy,
  for example:
  <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="default-src 'self'; img-src https://*; child-src 'none';"&gt;</code>
</p>

<h3 id="Mitigating_cross_site_scripting">Mitigating cross site scripting</h3>

<p>A primary goal of CSP is to mitigate and report XSS attacks. XSS attacks exploit the
  browser's trust of the content received from the server. Malicious scripts are executed
  by the victim's browser because the browser trusts the source of the content, even when
  it's not coming from where it seems to be coming from.</p>

<p>CSP makes it possible for server administrators to reduce or eliminate the vectors by
  which XSS can occur by specifying the domains that the browser should consider to be
  valid sources of executable scripts. A CSP compatible browser will then only execute
  scripts loaded in source files received from those allowlisted domains, ignoring all
  other script (including inline scripts and event-handling HTML attributes).</p>

<p>As an ultimate form of protection, sites that want to never allow scripts to be
  executed can opt to globally disallow script execution.</p>

<h3 id="Mitigating_packet_sniffing_attacks">Mitigating packet sniffing attacks</h3>

<p>In addition to restricting the domains from which content can be loaded, the server can
  specify which protocols are allowed to be used; for example (and ideally, from a
  security standpoint), a server can specify that all content must be loaded using HTTPS.
  A complete data transmission security strategy includes not only enforcing HTTPS for
  data transfer, but also marking all <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies">cookies with
    the <code>secure</code> attribute</a> and providing automatic redirects from HTTP
  pages to their HTTPS counterparts. Sites may also use the
  {{HTTPHeader("Strict-Transport-Security")}} HTTP header to ensure that browsers connect
  to them only over an encrypted channel<strong>.</strong></p>

<h2 id="Using_CSP">Using CSP</h2>

<p>Configuring Content Security Policy involves adding the
  {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}} HTTP header to a web page and giving it values
  to control what resources the user agent is allowed to load for that page. For example,
  a page that uploads and displays images could allow images from anywhere, but restrict a
  form action to a specific endpoint. A properly designed Content Security Policy helps
  protect a page against a cross site scripting attack. This article explains how to
  construct such headers properly, and provides examples.</p>

<h3 id="Specifying_your_policy">Specifying your policy</h3>

<p>You can use the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}} HTTP header to specify your
  policy, like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: html">Content-Security-Policy: <em>policy</em></pre>

<p>The policy is a string containing the policy directives describing your Content
  Security Policy.</p>

<h3 id="Writing_a_policy">Writing a policy</h3>

<p>A policy is described using a series of policy directives, each of which describes the
  policy for a certain resource type or policy area. Your policy should include a
  {{CSP("default-src")}} policy directive, which is a fallback for other resource types
  when they don't have policies of their own (for a complete list, see the description of
  the {{CSP("default-src")}} directive). A policy needs to include a
  {{CSP("default-src")}} or {{CSP("script-src")}} directive to prevent inline scripts from
  running, as well as blocking the use of <code>eval()</code>. A policy needs to include a
  {{CSP("default-src")}} or {{CSP("style-src")}} directive to restrict inline styles from
  being applied from a {{HTMLElement("style")}} element or a <code>style</code> attribute.
  There are specific directives for a wide variety of types of items, so that each type
  can have its own policy, including fonts, frames, images, audio and video media,
  scripts, and workers.</p>

<h2 id="Examples_Common_use_cases">Examples: Common use cases</h2>

<p>This section provides examples of some common security policy scenarios.</p>

<h3 id="Example_1">Example 1</h3>

<p>A web site administrator wants all content to come from the site's own origin (this
  excludes subdomains.)</p>

<pre class="brush: html">Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'</pre>

<h3 id="Example_2">Example 2</h3>

<p>A web site administrator wants to allow content from a trusted domain and all its
  subdomains (it doesn't have to be the same domain that the CSP is set on.)</p>

<pre
  class="brush: html">Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' trusted.com *.trusted.com</pre>

<h3 id="Example_3">Example 3</h3>

<p>A web site administrator wants to allow users of a web application to include images
  from any origin in their own content, but to restrict audio or video media to trusted
  providers, and all scripts only to a specific server that hosts trusted code.</p>

<pre
  class="brush: html">Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src *; media-src media1.com media2.com; script-src userscripts.example.com</pre>

<p>Here, by default, content is only permitted from the document's origin, with the
  following exceptions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Images may load from anywhere (note the "*" wildcard).</li>
  <li>Media is only allowed from media1.com and media2.com (and not from subdomains of
    those sites).</li>
  <li>Executable script is only allowed from userscripts.example.com.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Example_4">Example 4</h3>

<p>A web site administrator for an online banking site wants to ensure that all its
  content is loaded using TLS, in order to prevent attackers from eavesdropping on
  requests.</p>

<pre
  class="brush: html">Content-Security-Policy: default-src https://onlinebanking.jumbobank.com</pre>

<p>The server permits access only to documents being loaded specifically over HTTPS
  through the single origin onlinebanking.jumbobank.com.</p>

<h3 id="Example_5">Example 5</h3>

<p>A web site administrator of a web mail site wants to allow HTML in email, as well as
  images loaded from anywhere, but not JavaScript or other potentially dangerous content.
</p>

<pre
  class="brush: html">Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' *.mailsite.com; img-src *</pre>

<p>Note that this example doesn't specify a {{CSP("script-src")}}; with the example CSP,
  this site uses the setting specified by the {{CSP("default-src")}} directive, which
  means that scripts can be loaded only from the originating server.</p>

<h2 id="Testing_your_policy">Testing your policy</h2>

<p>To ease deployment, CSP can be deployed in report-only mode. The policy is not
  enforced, but any violations are reported to a provided URI. Additionally, a report-only
  header can be used to test a future revision to a policy without actually deploying it.
</p>

<p>You can use the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only")}} HTTP header to
  specify your policy, like this:</p>

<pre
  class="brush: html">Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: <em>policy</em> </pre>

<p>If both a {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only")}} header and a
  {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}} header are present in the same response, both
  policies are honored. The policy specified in <code>Content-Security-Policy</code>
  headers is enforced while the <code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only</code> policy
  generates reports but is not enforced.</p>

<h2 id="Enabling_reporting">Enabling reporting</h2>

<p>By default, violation reports aren't sent. To enable violation reporting, you need to
  specify the {{CSP("report-uri")}} policy directive, providing at least one URI to which
  to deliver the reports:</p>

<pre
  class="brush: html">Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; report-uri http://reportcollector.example.com/collector.cgi</pre>

<p>Then you need to set up your server to receive the reports; it can store or process
  them in whatever manner you determine is appropriate.</p>

<h2 id="Violation_report_syntax">Violation report syntax</h2>

<p>The report JSON object contains the following data:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>blocked-uri</code></dt>
  <dd>The URI of the resource that was blocked from loading by the Content Security
    Policy. If the blocked URI is from a different origin than the
    <code>document-uri</code>, then the blocked URI is truncated to contain just the
    scheme, host, and port.</dd>
  <dt><code>disposition</code></dt>
  <dd>Either <code>"enforce"</code> or <code>"report"</code> depending on whether the
    {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only")}} header or the
    <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header is used.</dd>
  <dt><code>document-uri</code></dt>
  <dd>The URI of the document in which the violation occurred.</dd>
  <dt><code>effective-directive</code></dt>
  <dd>The directive whose enforcement caused the violation. Some browsers may provide different values, such as Chrome providing <code>style-src-elem</code>/<code>style-src-attr</code>, even when the actual enforced directive was <code>style-src</code>.</dd>
  <dt><code>original-policy</code></dt>
  <dd>The original policy as specified by the <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> HTTP
    header.</dd>
  <dt><code>referrer</code></dt>
  <dd>The referrer of the document in which the violation occurred.</dd>
  <dt><code>script-sample</code></dt>
  <dd>The first 40 characters of the inline script, event handler, or style that caused
    the violation. Only applicable to <code>script-src*</code> and <code>style-src*</code> violations, when they contain the <code>'report-sample'</code></dd>
  <dt><code>status-code</code></dt>
  <dd>The HTTP status code of the resource on which the global object was instantiated.
  </dd>
  <dt><code>violated-directive</code></dt>
  <dd>The name of the policy section that was violated.</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="Sample_violation_report">Sample violation report</h2>

<p>Let's consider a page located at <code>http://example.com/signup.html</code>. It uses
  the following policy, disallowing everything but stylesheets from
  <code>cdn.example.com</code>.</p>

<pre class="brush: html">Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; style-src cdn.example.com; report-uri /_/csp-reports</pre>

<p>The HTML of <code>signup.html</code> looks like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Sign Up&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    ... Content ...
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>

<p>Can you spot the mistake? Stylesheets are allowed to be loaded only from
  <code>cdn.example.com</code>, yet the website tries to load one from its own origin
  (<code>http://example.com</code>). A browser capable of enforcing CSP would send the
  following violation report as a POST request to
  <code>http://example.com/_/csp-reports</code>, when the document is visited:</p>

<pre>{
  "csp-report": {
    "document-uri": "http://example.com/signup.html",
    "referrer": "",
    "blocked-uri": "http://example.com/css/style.css",
    "violated-directive": "style-src cdn.example.com",
    "original-policy": "default-src 'none'; style-src cdn.example.com; report-uri /_/csp-reports"
  }
}</pre>

<p>As you can see, the report includes the full path to the violating resource in
  <code>blocked-uri</code>. This is not always the case. For example, if the
  <code>signup.html</code> attempted to load CSS from
  <code>http://anothercdn.example.com/stylesheet.css</code>, the browser would
  <em>not</em> include the full path, but only the origin
  (<code>http://anothercdn.example.com</code>). The CSP specification <a
    href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP/#security-violation-reports">gives an explanation</a>
  of this odd behavior. In summary, this is done to prevent leaking sensitive information
  about cross-origin resources.</p>

<h2 id="Browser_compatibility">Browser compatibility</h2>

<p>{{Compat("http.headers.csp")}}</p>

<p>A specific incompatibility exists in some versions of the Safari web browser, whereby
  if a Content Security Policy header is set, but not a Same Origin header, the browser
  will block self-hosted content and off-site content, and incorrectly report that this is
  due to a the Content Security Policy not allowing the content.</p>
