The **`Width`** {{Glossary("Client hints","device client hint")}} request header field indicates the desired resource width in physical pixels â€” the intrinsic size of an image. The provided pixel value is a number rounded to the smallest following integer (i.e. ceiling value).

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Header type</th>
      <td>
        {{Glossary("Request header")}},
        {{Glossary("Client hints","Client hint")}}
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">{{Glossary("Forbidden header name")}}</th>
      <td>no</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The hint is particularly useful because it allows the client to request a resource that is optimal for both the screen and the layout: taking into account both the density-corrected width of the screen and the image's extrinsic size within the layout.

If the desired resource width is not known at the time of the request or the resource does not have a display width, the `Width` header field can be omitted.

If the `Width` header appears more than once in a message the last occurrence is used.

> **Note:**
>
> - Client Hints are accessible only on secure origins (via TLS).
> - A server has to opt in to receive the `Width` header from the client, by sending the {{HTTPHeader("Accept-CH")}} response header.
> - Servers that opt in to the `Width` client hint will typically also specify it in the {{HTTPHeader("Vary")}} header. This informs caches that the server may send different responses based on the header value in a request.
> - `Width` was removed from the client hints specification in [draft-ietf-httpbis-client-hints-07](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-hints-07). The proposed replacement is [`Sec-CH-Width`](https://wicg.github.io/responsive-image-client-hints/#sec-ch-width) (Responsive Image Client Hints).

## Syntax

```
Width: <number>
```

## Directives

- \<number>
  - : The width of the resource in physical pixels, rounded up to the nearest integer.

## Examples

The server first needs to opt in to receive the `Width` header by sending the response headers {{HTTPHeader("Accept-CH")}} containing `Width`.

```
Accept-CH: Width
```

Then on subsequent requests the client might send `Width` header back:

```
Width: 1920
```
