The HTTP 1.1 (only) `Upgrade` header can be used to upgrade an already established client/server connection to a different protocol (over the same transport protocol). For example, it can be used by a client to upgrade a connection from HTTP 1.1 to HTTP 2.0, or an HTTP or HTTPS connection into a WebSocket.

> **Warning:** HTTP/2 explicitly disallows the use of this mechanism/header; it is specific to HTTP/1.1.

## Overview

The `Upgrade` header field may be used by clients to invite a server to switch to one (or more) of the listed protocols, in descending preference order.

For example, the client might send a `GET` request as shown, listing the preferred protocols to switch to (in this case "example/1" and "foo/2"):

```http
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
Connection: upgrade
Upgrade: example/1, foo/2
```

> **Note:** `Connection: upgrade` must be set whenever `Upgrade` is sent.

The server can choose to ignore the request, for any reason, in which case it should just respond as though the `Upgrade` header had not been sent (for example, with a {{HTTPStatus(200, "200 OK")}}).

If the server decides to upgrade the connection, it must:

1. Send back a {{HTTPStatus(101, "101 Switching Protocols")}} response status with an `Upgrade` header that specifies the protocol(s) being switched to. For example:

   ```
   HTTP/1.1 101 Switching Protocols
   Upgrade: foo/2
   Connection: Upgrade
   ```

2. Send a response to the original request _using the new protocol_ (the server may only switch to a protocol with which it can complete the original request).

A server may also send the header as part of a {{HTTPStatus("426")}} `Upgrade Required` response, to indicate that the server won't perform the request using the current protocol, but might do so if the protocol is changed. The client can then request a protocol change using the process above.

More detail and examples are provided in the topic [Protocol upgrade mechanism](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Protocol_upgrade_mechanism).

## Syntax

```http
Connection: upgrade
Upgrade: protocol_name[/protocol_version]
```

Notes:

- The {{HTTPHeader("Connection")}} header with type `upgrade` must _always_ be sent with the `Upgrade` header (as shown above).
- Protocols are listed, comma-separated, in order of descending preference. Protocol version is optional. For example:

```http
Connection: upgrade
Upgrade: a_protocol/1, example, another_protocol/2.2
```

## Directives

- any comma-separated list protocol names (each with optional protocol version)
  - : One or more protocol names with optional version ("/" separated). The protocols are listed in order of descending preference.

## Examples

```http
Connection: upgrade
Upgrade: HTTP/2.0, SHTTP/1.3, IRC/6.9, RTA/x11
```

```http
Connection: Upgrade
Upgrade: websocket
```
