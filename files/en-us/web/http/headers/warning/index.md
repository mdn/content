The **`Warning`** HTTP header contains information
about possible problems with the status of the message. More than one
`Warning` header may appear in a response.

`Warning` header fields can, in general, be applied to any message. However, some warn-codes are specific to caches and can only be applied to response messages.

## Syntax

```
Warning: <warn-code> <warn-agent> <warn-text> [<warn-date>]
```

## Directives

- \<warn-code>

  - : A three-digit warning number. The first digit indicates whether the
    `Warning` is required to be deleted from a stored response after
    validation.

    - `1xx` warn-codes describe the freshness or validation status of the
      response and will be deleted by a cache after deletion.
    - `2xx` warn-codes describe some aspect of the representation that is
      not rectified by a validation and will not be deleted by a cache after validation
      unless a full response is sent.

- \<warn-agent>
  - : The name or pseudonym of the server or software adding the `Warning`
    header (might be "-" when the agent is unknown).
- \<warn-text>
  - : An advisory text describing the error.
- \<warn-date>
  - : A date. This is optional. If more than one `Warning` header is sent, include a date that
    matches the {{HTTPHeader("Date")}} header.

## Warning codes

The [HTTP Warn Codes registry at iana.org](https://www.iana.org/assignments/http-warn-codes/http-warn-codes.xhtml) defines the namespace for warning codes.

| Code | Text                             | Description                                                                                                                           |
| ---- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 110  | Response is Stale                | The response provided by a cache is stale (the expiration time set for the response has passed).                                                  |
| 111  | Revalidation Failed              | An attempt to validate the stale response failed due to an inability to reach the server.                                                  |
| 112  | Disconnected Operation           | The cache is intentionally disconnected from the rest of the network.                                                                               |
| 113  | Heuristic Expiration             | A cache heuristically chose a freshness lifetime greater than 24 hours and the age of the response is greater than 24 hours.       |
| 199  | Miscellaneous Warning            | Arbitrary information that should be presented to a user or logged.                                                                                                       |
| 214  | Transformation Applied           | Added by a proxy if it applies any transformation to the representation, such as changing the content-coding, media-type or the like. |
| 299  | Miscellaneous Persistent Warning | Arbitrary information that should be presented to a user or logged. This warn-code is similar to the warn-code 199 and additionally indicates a persistent warning.                                                                                      |
