The **`Sec-Browsing-Topics`** request header sends observed topics along with a request, which are used by an ad tech platform to choose a personalized ad to display to the current user.

See the [Topics API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Topics_API) for more details.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Header type</th>
      <td>{{Glossary("Request header")}}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">{{Glossary("Forbidden header name")}}</th>
      <td>yes (prefix <code>Sec-</code>)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

## Syntax

```http
Sec-Browsing-Topics: <array-of-observed-topics>
```

## Directives

A JSON object representing an array of objects containing the observed topics. Each object contains the following properties:

- `configVersion`
  - : A string identifying the algorithm (other than the model part) used to calculate the topic.
- `modelVersion`
  - : A string representing the model used to classify a string (such as a web page's hostname) into topic IDs.
- `taxonomyVersion`
  - : A string representing the taxonomy version used.
- `topic`
  - : A number representing the ID of the topic, which can be used by the browser to retrieve the topic from the taxonomy (see an example [taxonomy of interests](https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/topics/blob/main/taxonomy_v1.md)).
- `version`
  - : The `configVersion`, `modelVersion`, and `taxonomyVersion`, concatenated with colons (`:`) between each.

## Examples

The exact property values may vary by browser implementation. An example header from Chrome might look as follows:

```http
Sec-Browsing-Topics: [{configVersion: "chrome.1", modelVersion: "1", taxonomyVersion: "1", topic: 43, version: "chrome.1:1:1"}]
```
