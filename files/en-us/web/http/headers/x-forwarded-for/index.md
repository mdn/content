The **`X-Forwarded-For`** (XFF) request header is a de-facto standard header for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through a proxy server.

> **Warning:** Improper use of this header can be a security risk. For details, see the [Security and privacy concerns](#security_and_privacy_concerns) section.

When a client connects directly to a server, the
client's IP address is sent to the server (and is often written to server
access logs). But if a client connection passes through any [forward or reverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server) proxies, the server only
sees the final proxy's IP address, which is often of little use. That's especially true if
the final proxy is a load balancer which is part of the same installation
as the server. So, to provide a more-useful client IP address to the server, the `X-Forwarded-For` request header is
used.

For detailed guidance on using this header, see the [Parsing](#parsing) and [Selecting an IP address](#selecting_an_ip_address) sections.

A standardized version of this header is the HTTP {{HTTPHeader("Forwarded")}} header.

## Security and privacy concerns

This header, by design, exposes privacy-sensitive information, such as the IP address
of the client. Therefore the user's privacy must be kept in mind when deploying this
header.

The `X-Forwarded-For` header is untrustworthy when no trusted reverse proxy (e.g., a load balancer) is between the client and
server. If the client and all proxies are benign and well-behaved, then the list of IP addresses in the header
has the meaning described in the [Directives](#directives) section. But if there's a risk the client or any proxy
is malicious or misconfigured, then it's possible any part (or the entirety) of the header may have been
spoofed (and may not be a list or contain IP addresses at all).

If any trusted reverse proxies are between the client and
server, the final `X-Forwarded-For` IP addresses (one for each trusted proxy) are trustworthy, as they
were added by trusted proxies. (That's true as long as the server is _only_
accessible through those proxies and not also directly).

Any security-related use of `X-Forwarded-For` (such as for rate limiting or IP-based
access control) _must only_ use IP addresses added by a trusted proxy. Using untrustworthy
values can result in rate-limiter avoidance, access-control bypass, memory exhaustion, or
other negative security or availability consequences.

Conversely, leftmost (untrusted) values must only be used where there will be no negative
impact from the possibility of using spoofed values.

## Syntax

```http
X-Forwarded-For: <client>, <proxy1>, <proxy2>
```

Elements are comma-separated, with optional whitespace surrounding the commas.

## Directives

- \<client>
  - : The client IP address
- \<proxy1>, \<proxy2>
  - : If a request goes through multiple proxies, the IP addresses of each successive
    proxy is listed. This means that, given well-behaved client and proxies, the rightmost
    IP address is the IP address of the most recent proxy and the leftmost IP address is
    the IP address of the originating client.

## Examples

```http
X-Forwarded-For: 2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348

X-Forwarded-For: 203.0.113.195

X-Forwarded-For: 203.0.113.195, 2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348

X-Forwarded-For: 203.0.113.195,2001:db8:85a3:8d3:1319:8a2e:370:7348,150.172.238.178
```

## Parsing

Improper parsing of the `X-Forwarded-For` header can result in spoofed values being used
for security-related purposes, resulting in the negative consequences mentioned above.

There may be multiple `X-Forwarded-For` headers present in a request. The IP addresses in
these headers must be treated as a single list, starting with the first IP address of the
first header and continuing to the last IP address of the last header. There are two ways
of making this single list:

- join the `X-Forwarded-For` full header values with commas and then split by comma into a list, or
- split each `X-Forwarded-For` header by comma into lists and then join the lists

It is insufficient to use only one of multiple `X-Forwarded-For` headers.

(Some reverse proxies will automatically join multiple `X-Forwarded-For` headers into one,
but it is safest to not assume that this is the case.)

## Selecting an IP address

When selecting an address, the full list of IPs — from all `X-Forwarded-For` headers — must be used.

When choosing the `X-Forwarded-For` client IP address closest to the client (untrustworthy
and _not_ for security-related purposes), the first IP from the leftmost that is _a valid
address_ and _not private/internal_ should be selected. ("Valid" because spoofed values
may not be IP addresses at all; "not internal/private" because clients may have used
proxies on their internal network, which may have added addresses from the [private IP space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network).)

When choosing the first _trustworthy_ `X-Forwarded-For` client IP address, additional
configuration is required. There are two common methods:

- **Trusted proxy count**: The count of reverse proxies between the internet and the
  server is configured. The `X-Forwarded-For` IP list is searched from the rightmost by
  that count minus one. (For example, if there is only one reverse proxy, that proxy will
  add the client's IP address, so the rightmost address should be used. If there are
  three reverse proxies, the last two IP addresses will be internal.)
- **Trusted proxy list**: The IPs or IP ranges of the trusted reverse proxies are
  configured. The `X-Forwarded-For` IP list is searched from the rightmost, skipping all
  addresses that are on the trusted proxy list. The first non-matching address is the
  target address.

The first trustworthy `X-Forwarded-For` IP address may belong to an untrusted intermediate
proxy rather than the actual client computer, but it is the only IP suitable for security
uses.

Note that if the server is directly connectable from the internet — even if it is also
behind a trusted reverse proxy — _no part_ of the `X-Forwarded-For` IP list can be
considered trustworthy or safe for security-related uses.
