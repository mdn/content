The **`From`** request header contains an Internet email
address for a human user who controls the requesting user agent.

If you are running a robotic user agent (e.g. a crawler), the `From` header
must be sent, so you can be contacted if problems occur on servers, such as if the
robot is sending excessive, unwanted, or invalid requests.

> **Warning:** You must not use the `From` header for access control or authentication.
