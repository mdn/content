The **`Downlink`** {{Glossary("Client hints","network client hint")}} request header field provides the approximate bandwidth of the client's connection to the server, in Mbps.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Header type</th>
      <td>
        {{Glossary("Request header")}},
        {{Glossary("Client hints","Client hint")}}
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">{{Glossary("Forbidden header name")}}</th>
      <td>no</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The `Downlink` value is given in Mbps and rounded to the nearest 25 kilobits per second to prevent fingerprinting; There are many other mechanisms an attacker might use to obtain similar information.

The hint allows a server to choose what information is sent based on the network bandwidth. For example, a server might choose to send smaller versions of images and other resources on low bandwidth networks.

> **Note:** The {{HTTPHeader("Vary")}} header is used in responses to indicate that a different resource is sent for every different value of the header (see [HTTP Caching > Varying responses](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching#varying_responses)). Even if {{HTTPHeader("Downlink")}} is used to configure what resources are sent, consider omitting it in the {{HTTPHeader("Vary")}} header â€” it is likely to change often, which effectively makes the resource uncachable.

## Syntax

```
Downlink: <number>
```

## Directives

- \<number>
  - : The downlink rate in Mbps, rounded to the nearest 25 kilobits.

## Examples

A server first needs to opt in to receive the `Downlink` header by sending the {{HTTPHeader("Accept-CH")}} response header containing `Downlink`.

```
Accept-CH: Downlink
```

Then on subsequent requests the client might send a `Downlink` header back:

```
Downlink: 1.7
```
