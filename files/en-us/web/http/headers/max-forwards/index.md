The **`Max-Forwards`** request HTTP header is used with the [`TRACE`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/TRACE) method to limit the number of nodes (usually proxies) that request goes through. Its value is an integer value indicating the _maximum amount_ of nodes it must visit. At each node, the value is decremented and the `TRACE` request is forwarded to the next node, until the destination is reached, or the received value of `Max-Forwards` is zero. The request is then sent back, except for some headers, as the body of a `200 OK` response.

If the `Max-Forwards` header is not present in a `TRACE` request, a node will assume that there is no maximum number of forwards.
