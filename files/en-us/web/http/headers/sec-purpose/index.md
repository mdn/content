The **`Sec-Purpose`** {{Glossary("Fetch metadata request header", "fetch metadata request header")}} indicates the purpose for which the requested resource will be used, when that purpose is something other than immediate use by the user-agent.

The only purpose that is currently defined is `prefetch`, which indicates that the resource is being requested in anticipation that it will be needed by a page that is likely to be navigated to in the near future, such as a page linked in search results or a link that a user has hovered over.
The server can use this knowledge to: adjust the caching expiry for the request, disallow the request, or perhaps to treat it differently when counting page visits.

The header is sent when a page is loaded that has a [`<link>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) element with attribute [`rel="prefetch"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/prefetch).
Note that if this header is set then a {{HTTPHeader("Sec-Fetch-Dest")}} header in the request must be set to `empty` (any value in the [`<link>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) attribute [`as`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#as) is ignored) and the {{HTTPHeader("Accept")}} header should match the value used for normal navigation requests.

## Syntax

```http
Sec-Purpose: prefetch
```

## Directives

The allowed tokens are:

- `prefetch`
  - : The purpose is to prefetch a resource that may be needed in a probable future navigation.

## Examples

## A prefetch request

Consider the case where a browser loads a file with a [`<link>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link) element that has the attribute `rel="prefetch"` and an `href` attribute containing the address of an image file.
The resulting `fetch()` should result in an HTTP request where `Sec-Purpose: prefetch`, `Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty`, and an `Accept` value that is the same as the browser uses for page navigation.

An example of such a header (on Firefox) is given below:

```http
GET /images/some_image.png HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/116.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Sec-Purpose: prefetch
Connection: keep-alive
Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty
Sec-Fetch-Mode: no-cors
Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin
Pragma: no-cache
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

> **Note:** At time of writing FireFox incorrectly sets the `Accept` header as `Accept: */*` for prefetches.
> The example has been modified to show what the `Accept` value should be.
> This issue can be tracked in [Firefox bug 1836334](https://bugzil.la/1836334).
