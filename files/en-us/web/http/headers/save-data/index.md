The **`Save-Data`** [network client hint](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client_hints#network_client_hints) request header field is a boolean which indicates the client's preference for reduced data usage.
This could be for reasons such as high transfer costs, slow connection speeds, etc.

**`Save-Data`** is a [low entropy hint](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client_hints#low_entropy_hints), and hence may be sent by the client even if not requested by the server using an {{HTTPHeader("Accept-CH")}} response header.
Further, it should be used to reduce data sent to the client irrespective of the values of other client hints that indicate network capability, like {{HTTPHeader("Downlink")}} and {{HTTPHeader("RTT")}}.

<table class="properties">

    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Header type</th>

A value of `On` indicates explicit user opt-in into a reduced data usage
mode on the client, and when communicated to origins allows them to deliver alternative
content to reduce the data downloaded such as smaller image and video resources,
different markup and styling, disabled polling and automatic updates, and so on.

> **Note:** Disabling HTTP/2 Server Push ({{RFC("7540", "Server Push", "8.2")}}) might be desirable too for reducing data downloads.

## Syntax

```http
Save-Data: <sd-token>
```

## Directives

- `<sd-token>`
  - : A value indicating whether the client wants to opt in to reduced data usage mode.
    `on` indicates yes, while `off` (the default) indicates no.

## Examples

The {{HTTPHeader("Vary")}} header ensures that the content is cached properly (for
instance ensuring that the user is not served a lower-quality image from the cache when
`Save-Data` header is no longer present \[_e.g._ after having switched from cellular to Wi-Fi]).
