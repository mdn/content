{{HTTPSidebar}}

The HTTP **`Content-Digest`** {{Glossary("request header", "request")}} and {{Glossary("response header")}} provides a {{Glossary("digest")}} calculated using a hashing algorithm applied to the message content.
A recipient can use the `Content-Digest` to validate the HTTP message content for integrity purposes.

The {{HTTPHeader("Want-Content-Digest")}} field lets a sender request a `Content-Digest` along with their hashing algorithm preferences.
A content digest will differ based on {{HTTPHeader("Content-Encoding")}} and {{HTTPHeader("Content-Range")}}, but not {{HTTPHeader("Transfer-Encoding")}}.

In certain cases, a {{HTTPHeader("Repr-Digest")}} can be used to validate the integrity of partial or multipart messages against the full representation.
For example, in [range requests](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests), a `Repr-Digest` will always have the same value if only the requested byte ranges differ, whereas the content digest will be different for each part.
For this reason, a `Content-Digest` is identical to a {{HTTPHeader("Repr-Digest")}} when a representation is sent in a single message.

## Syntax

```http
Content-Digest: <digest-algorithm>=<digest-value>

// Multiple digest algorithms
Content-Digest: <digest-algorithm>=<digest-value>,<digest-algorithm>=<digest-value>, â€¦
```

## Directives

- `<digest-algorithm>`
  - : The algorithm used to create a digest of the message content.
    Only two registered digest algorithms are considered secure: `sha-512` and `sha-256`.
    The insecure (legacy) registered digest algorithms are: `md5`, `sha` (SHA-1), `unixsum`, `unixcksum`, `adler` (ADLER32) and `crc32c`.
- `<digest-value>`
  - : The digest in bytes of the message content using the `<digest-algorithm>`.
    The choice of digest algorithm also determines the encoding to use: `sha-512` and `sha-256` use {{Glossary("base64")}} encoding, while some legacy digest algorithms such as `unixsum` use a decimal integer.
    In contrast to earlier drafts of the specification, the standard base64-encoded digest bytes are wrapped in colons (`:`, ASCII 0x3A) as part of the [dictionary syntax](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8941#name-byte-sequences).

## Description

A `Digest` header was defined in previous specifications, but it proved problematic as the scope of what the digest applied to was not clear.
Specifically, it was difficult to distinguish whether a digest applied to the entire resource representation or to the specific content of a HTTP message.
As such, two separate headers were specified (`Content-Digest` and `Repr-Digest`) to convey HTTP message content digests and resource representation digests, respectively.

## Examples

### Client requests a SHA-256 Content-Digest

In the following request, a client requests a SHA-256 digest of the message content:

```http
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Want-Content-Digest: sha-256=10, sha=3
```

The server responds with a `Content-Digest` of the message content:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Digest: sha-256=:RK/0qy18MlBSVnWgjwz6lZEWjP/lF5HF9bvEF8FabDg=:

{"hello": "world"}
```

### Identical Content-Digest and Repr-Digest values

A client requests a resource without a `Want-Content-Digest` field:

```http
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

In this case, the server is configured to send unsolicited digest headers in responses.
Both the `Repr-Digest` and `Content-Digest` fields have matching values:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: 19
Content-Digest: sha-256=:RK/0qy18MlBSVnWgjwz6lZEWjP/lF5HF9bvEF8FabDg=:
Repr-Digest: sha-256=:RK/0qy18MlBSVnWgjwz6lZEWjP/lF5HF9bvEF8FabDg=:

{"hello": "world"}
```

### Diverging Content-Digest and Repr-Digest values

If the same request is repeated as the previous example, but uses a {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}} method instead of a {{HTTPMethod("GET")}}, the `Repr-Digest` and `Content-Digest` fields will be different:

```http
GET /items/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

The `Repr-Digest` value will be the same as before, but there is no message body, so a different `Content-Digest` would be sent by the server:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Digest: sha-256=:47DEQpj8HBSa+/TImW+5JCeuQeRkm5NMpJWZG3hSuFU=:
Repr-Digest: sha-256=:RK/0qy18MlBSVnWgjwz6lZEWjP/lF5HF9bvEF8FabDg=:
```

## Browser compatibility

This header has no specification-defined browser integration ("browser compatibility" does not apply).
Developers can set and get HTTP headers using `fetch()` in order to provide application-specific implementation behavior.
