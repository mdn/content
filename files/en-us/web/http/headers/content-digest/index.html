The **`Content-Digest`** response header provides the client with a {{Glossary("digest")}} of the requested _actual message content_, the preimage of computing the _selected representation_ (e.&hairsp;g. [Range Requests](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests) or [Content Encoding](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation)). Note that the selected representation is independent of wire transmission (e.&hairsp;g. HTTP/1.1's {{HTTPHeader("Transfer-Encoding")}}). Note furthermore that the actual message content is dependent on {{HTTPHeader("Accept")}}ed representations (else the digest would be of little use since there would not be an unambiguous correspondence between `Content-` and enough `Repr-`).  
A client can request that a server emit a **`Content-Digest`** by issuing {{HTTPHeader("Want-Content-Digest")}}.
