{{HTTPSidebar}}

The HTTP **`Vary`** {{Glossary("response header")}} describes the parts of the request message (aside from the method and URL) that influenced the content of the response it occurs in.
Including a `Vary` header ensures that responses are separately cached based on the headers listed in the `Vary` field.
Most often, this is used to create a cache key when [content negotiation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation) is in use.

The same `Vary` header value should be used on all responses for a given URL, including {{HTTPStatus("304")}} `Not Modified` responses and the "default" response.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Header type</th>
      <td>{{Glossary("Response header")}}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">{{Glossary("Forbidden header name")}}</th>
      <td>No</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Syntax

```
