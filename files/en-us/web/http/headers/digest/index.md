The **`Digest`** response HTTP header provides a {{Glossary("digest")}} of the _selected representation_ of the requested resource.

Representations are different forms of a particular resource that might be returned from a request: for example, the same resource might be formatted in a particular media type such as XML or JSON, localized to a particular written language or geographical region, and/or compressed or otherwise encoded for transmission.
The _selected representation_ is the actual format of a resource that is returned following [content negotiation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation), and can be determined from the response's {{Glossary("Representation header","Representation headers")}}.

The digest applies to the whole representation of a resource, not to a particular message.
It can be used to verify that the representation data has not been modified during transmission.

> **Note:** While a representation may be fully contained in the message body of a single response, it can also be sent using multiple messages in response to a [range request](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests), or omitted altogether in response to a {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}} request.

## Syntax

```http
Digest: <digest-algorithm>=<digest-value>
Digest: <digest-algorithm>=<digest-value>,<digest-algorithm>=<digest-value>
```

## Directives

- `<digest-algorithm>`
  - : Digest algorithms are defined in [Digest Headers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-digest-headers/).
    - Permitted digest algorithms values include: `unixsum`, `unixcksum`, `crc32c`, `sha-256` and `sha-512`, `id-sha-256`, `id-sha-512`
    - Deprecated algorithms values include: `md5`, `sha`, `adler32`.
- `<digest-value>`
  - : The result of applying the digest algorithm to the resource representation and encoding the result.
    The choice of digest algorithm also determines the encoding to use: for example `SHA-256` uses base64 encoding.

## Examples

```http
Digest: sha-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=
Digest: sha-256=X48E9qOokqqrvdts8nOJRJN3OWDUoyWxBf7kbu9DBPE=,unixsum=30637
