> **Warning:** This feature is currently opposed by two browser vendors. See the [Standards positions](#standards_positions) section below for details of opposition.

The **`Observe-Browsing-Topics`** response header is used to mark topics of interest inferred from a calling site's URL (i.e. the site where the ad tech `<iframe>` is embedded) as observed in the response to a request generated by a [feature that enables the Topics API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Topics_API/Using#what_api_features_enable_the_topics_api). The browser will subsequently use those topics to calculate top topics for the current user for future epochs.

See [Using the Topics API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Topics_API/Using) for more details.
