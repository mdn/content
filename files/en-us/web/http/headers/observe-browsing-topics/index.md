The HTTP **`Observe-Browsing-Topics`** {{Glossary("response header")}} is used to mark topics of interest inferred from a calling site's URL (i.e., the site where the ad tech {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} is embedded) as observed in the response to a request generated by a [feature that enables the Topics API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Topics_API/Using#what_api_features_enable_the_topics_api).
The browser will subsequently use those topics to calculate top topics for the current user for future epochs.

See [Using the Topics API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Topics_API/Using) for more details.
