The HTTP **`If-Match`** {{Glossary("request header")}} makes a request [conditional](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Conditional_requests).
A server will return resources for {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} and {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}} methods, or upload resource for {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}} and other non-safe methods, only if the resource matches one of the {{HTTPHeader("ETag")}} values in the `If-Match` request header.
If the conditional does not match, the {{HTTPStatus("412", "412 Precondition Failed")}} response is returned instead.

The comparison with the stored {{HTTPHeader("ETag")}} uses the _strong comparison algorithm_, meaning two files are considered identical byte-by-byte.
If a listed `ETag` has the `W/` prefix indicating a weak entity tag, this comparison algorithm will never match it.

There are two common use cases:

- For {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} and {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}} methods, used in combination with a {{HTTPHeader("Range")}} header, it can guarantee that the new ranges requested
  come from the same resource as the previous one.
- For other methods, and in particular for {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}}, `If-Match` can be used to prevent the [lost update problem](https://www.w3.org/1999/04/Editing/#3.1).
  It can check if the modification of a resource that the user wants to upload will not override another change that has been done since the original resource was fetched.

## Syntax

```http
If-Match: <etag_value>
If-Match: <etag_value>, <etag_value>, â€¦
```

## Directives

- `<etag_value>`
  - : Entity tags uniquely representing the requested resources.
    They are a string of {{Glossary("ASCII")}} characters placed between double quotes (like `"675af34563dc-tr34"`).
    They may be prefixed by `W/` to indicate that they are 'weak', i.e. that they represent the resource semantically but not byte-by-byte.
    However, in an `If-Match` header, weak entity tags will never match.
- `*`
  - : The asterisk is a special value representing any resource.
    Note that this must match as `false` if the origin server does not have a current representation for the target resource.

## Examples

```http
If-Match: "bfc13a64729c4290ef5b2c2730249c88ca92d82d"

If-Match: "67ab43", "54ed21", "7892dd"

If-Match: *
```
