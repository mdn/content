## Examples

### Using Sec-CH-UA-Form-Factors

A server requests the `Sec-CH-UA-Form-Factors` header by including the {{HTTPHeader("Accept-CH")}} in a _response_ to any request from the client, using the name of the desired header as a token:

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Accept-CH: Sec-CH-UA-Form-Factors
```

The client may choose to provide the hint, and add the `Sec-CH-UA-Form-Factors` header to subsequent requests.
For example, the client might add the header as shown:

```http
GET /my/page HTTP/1.1
Host: example.site

Sec-CH-UA-Mobile: ?0
Sec-CH-UA-Form-Factors: "EInk"
```

In this case, `"EInk"` means that the device is characterized by slow screen updates and limited color resolution, and as such, responses may differ depending on this hint.
