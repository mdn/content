The **`Referer`** HTTP request header contains the absolute or partial address from which a resource has been requested.
The `Referer` header allows a server to identify referring pages that people are visiting from or where requested resources are being used.
This data can be used for analytics, logging, optimized caching, and more.

When you click a link, the **`Referer`** contains the address of the page that includes the link.
When you make resource requests to another domain, the **`Referer`** contains the address of the page that uses the requested resource.

The `Referer` header can contain an _origin_, _path_, and _querystring_, and may not contain URL fragments (i.e. `#section`) or `username:password` information.
The request's _referrer policy_ defines the data that can be included. See {{HTTPHeader("Referrer-Policy")}} for more [information](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy#directives) and [examples](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy#examples).

> **Note:** The header name "referer" is actually a misspelling of the word "referrer".
> See [HTTP referer on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_referer) for more details.

> **Warning:** This header may have undesirable consequences for user security and privacy.
> See [Referer header: privacy and security concerns](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Referer_header:_privacy_and_security_concerns) for more information and mitigation hints.
