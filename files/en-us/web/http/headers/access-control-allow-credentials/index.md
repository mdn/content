The **`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`** response header
tells browsers whether to expose the response to the frontend JavaScript code when the
request's credentials mode ({{domxref("Request.credentials")}}) is `include`.

When a request's credentials mode ({{domxref("Request.credentials")}}) is
`include`, browsers will only expose the response to the frontend JavaScript code
if the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` value is `true`.

Credentials are cookies, authorization headers, or TLS client certificates.

When used as part of a response to a preflight request, this indicates whether or not
the actual request can be made using credentials. Note that simple {{HTTPMethod("GET")}}
requests are not preflighted. So, if a request is made for a resource with
credentials, and if this header is not returned with the resource; the response is ignored
by the browser and not returned to the web content.

The `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header works in conjunction with the
{{domxref("XMLHttpRequest.withCredentials")}} property or with the
`credentials` option in the {{domxref("Request.Request()", "Request()")}}
constructor of the Fetch API. For a CORS request with credentials, for browsers
to expose the response to the frontend JavaScript code, both the server (using the
`Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header) and the client (by setting the
credentials mode for the XHR, Fetch, or Ajax request) must indicate that theyâ€™re opting
into including credentials.

## Syntax

```
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

## Directives

- true
  - : The only valid value for this header is `true` (case-sensitive). If you
    don't need credentials, omit this header entirely (rather than setting its value to
    `false`).

## Examples

Allow credentials:

```
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
```

Using [XHR](/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest) with credentials:

```js
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open('GET', 'http://example.com/', true);
xhr.withCredentials = true;
xhr.send(null);
```

Using [Fetch](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) with credentials:

```js
fetch(url, {
  credentials: 'include'
})
```
