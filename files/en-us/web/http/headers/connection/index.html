<div>{{HTTPSidebar}}</div>

<p>The <strong><code>Connection</code></strong> general header controls whether or not the
  network connection stays open after the current transaction finishes. If the value sent
  is <code>keep-alive</code>, the connection is persistent and not closed, allowing for
  subsequent requests to the same server to be done.</p>

<div class="notecard warning">
  <h4>Warning</h4>
  <p>Connection-specific header fields such as {{HTTPHeader("Connection")}} and
    {{HTTPHeader("Keep-Alive")}} are <a
      href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7540#section-8.1.2.2">prohibited in HTTP/2</a>.
    Chrome and Firefox ignore them in HTTP/2 responses, but Safari conforms to the HTTP/2
    spec requirements and won’t load any response which contains them.</p>
</div>

<p>Except for the standard hop-by-hop headers ({{HTTPHeader("Keep-Alive")}},
  {{HTTPHeader("Transfer-Encoding")}}, {{HTTPHeader("TE")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Connection")}},
  {{HTTPHeader("Trailer")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Upgrade")}},
  {{HTTPHeader("Proxy-Authorization")}} and {{HTTPHeader("Proxy-Authenticate")}}), any
  hop-by-hop headers used by the message must be listed in the <code>Connection</code>
  header, so that the first proxy knows it has to consume them and not forward them
  further. Standard hop-by-hop headers are also required to be listed.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><code>close</code></dt>
  <dd>Indicates that either the client or the server would like to close the connection.
    This is the default on HTTP/1.0 requests.</dd>
  <dt>any comma-separated list of HTTP headers [Usually <code>keep-alive</code> only]</dt>
  <dd>Indicates that the client would like to keep the connection open. Having a
    persistent connection is the default on HTTP/1.1 requests. The list of headers are the
    name of the header to be removed by the first non-transparent proxy or cache
    in-between: these headers define the connection between the emitter and the first
    entity, not the destination node.</dd>
