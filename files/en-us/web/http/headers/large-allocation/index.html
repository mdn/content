<p>The non-standard <strong><code>Large-Allocation</code></strong> response header tells
  the browser that the page being loaded is going to want to perform a large allocation.
  It is currently only implemented in Firefox, but is harmless to send to every browser.
</p>

<p><a href="/en-US/docs/WebAssembly">WebAssembly</a> or asm.js applications can use large
  contiguous blocks of allocated memory. For complex games, for example, these allocations
  can be quite large, sometimes as large as 1GB. The <code>Large-Allocation</code> tells
  the browser that the web content in the to-be-loaded page is going to want to perform a
  large contiguous memory allocation and the browser can react to this header by starting
  a dedicated process for the to-be-loaded document, for example.</p>

<h2 id="Troubleshooting_errors">Troubleshooting errors</h2>

<p>The <code>Large-Allocation</code> header throws warnings or error messages when used
  incorrectly. You'll encounter them in the <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console">web
    console</a>.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>This page was loaded in a new process due to a <code>Large-Allocation</code> header.
  </dt>
  <dd>This message means that the browser saw the <code>Large-Allocation</code> header,
    and was able to reload the page into a new process which should have more available
    contiguous memory.</dd>
  <dt>A <code>Large-Allocation</code> header was ignored due to the load being triggered
    by a non-GET request.</dt>
  <dd>When a {{HTTPMethod("POST")}} request is used to load a document, that loadÂ cannot
    currently be redirected into a new process. This error is displayed when loading a
    document with a <code>Large-Allocation</code> header with a non-GET HTTP method. This
    could be caused due to the document being loaded by a form submission, for example.
  </dd>
  <dt>A <code>Large-Allocation</code> header was ignored due to the presence of windows
    which have a reference to this browsing context through the frame hierarchy or
    {{domxref("window.opener")}}.</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>This error means that the document was not loaded at the top level of an
      user-opened or noopener-opened tab or window. It can occur in these situations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The document with the <code>Large-Allocation</code> header was loaded in an
        {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}. Firefox cannot move an iframe into a new process
        currently, so the document must load in the current process.</li>
      <li>The document with the <code>Large-Allocation</code> header was loaded in a
        window which was opened by {{domxref("window.open()")}},
        <code>&lt;a target="_blank"&gt;</code> or other similar methods without
        <code>rel="noopener"</code> or the <code>"noopener"</code> feature being set.
        These windows must remain in the same process as their opener, as they can
        communicate, meaning that we cannot allow them to switch processes.</li>
      <li>The document with the <code>Large-Allocation header</code> has opened another
        window with {{domxref("window.open()")}}, <code>&lt;a target="_blank"&gt;</code>
        or other similar methods without <code>rel="noopener"</code> or the
        <code>"noopener"</code> feature being set. This is for the same reason as above,
        namely that they can communicate and thus we cannot allow them to switch
        processes.</li>
    </ul>
  </dd>
  <dt>A <code>Large-Allocation</code> header was ignored due to the document not being
    loaded out of process.</dt>
  <dd>Firefox has moved to a <a
      href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox">multiprocess
      architecture</a>, and this architecture is required in order to support the
    <code>Large-Allocation</code> header. Some <a
      href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/SDK">legacy Addons</a> can prevent Firefox from
    using this new, faster, multiprocess architecture. If you have one of these Addons
    installed, then we will continue to use the old single process architecuture for
    compatibility, and cannot handle the <code>Large-Allocation</code> header.</dd>
  <dt>This page would be loaded in a new process due to a <code>Large-Allocation</code>
    header, however <code>Large-Allocation</code> process creation is disabled on
    non-Win32 platforms.</dt>
  <dd>Firefox currently only supports the <code>Large-Allocation</code> header in our
    32-bit Windows builds, as memory fragmentation is not an issue in 64-bit builds. If
    you are running a non-win32 version of Firefox, this error will appear. This check can
    be disabled with the "dom.largeAllocation.
    <p>forceEnable" boolean preferece in about:config.</p>
