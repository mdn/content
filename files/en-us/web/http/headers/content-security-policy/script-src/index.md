{{HTTPSidebar}}

The HTTP {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}} (CSP) **`script-src`** directive specifies valid sources for JavaScript. This includes not only URLs loaded directly into {{HTMLElement("script")}} elements, but also things like inline script event handlers (`onclick`) and [XSLT stylesheets](/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT) which can trigger script execution.

## Syntax

One or more sources can be allowed for the `script-src` policy:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: script-src <source>;
Content-Security-Policy: script-src <source> <source>;
```

### Sources

`<source>` can be any one of the values listed in [CSP Source Values](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/Sources#sources).

Note that this same set of values can be used in all {{Glossary("fetch directive", "fetch directives")}} (and a [number of other directives](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/Sources#relevant_directives)).

## Examples

### Blocking resources from untrusted domains

Given this CSP header that only allows scripts from `https://example.com`:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: script-src https://example.com/
```

the following script is blocked and won't be loaded or executed:

```html
<script src="https://not-example.com/js/library.js"></script>
```

Note that inline event handlers are blocked as well:

```html
<button id="btn" onclick="doSomething()"></button>
```

You should replace them with {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener")}} calls:

```js
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", doSomething);
```

If you cannot replace inline event handlers, you can use the `'unsafe-hashes'` source expression to allow them.
See [Unsafe hashes](#unsafe_hashes) for more information.

### Unsafe inline script

> **Note:**
> Disallowing inline styles and inline scripts is one of the biggest security wins CSP provides.
> If you absolutely have to use them, there are a few mechanisms that will allow them.
> Hashes apply to inline scripts and styles, but not event handlers.
> See [Unsafe hashes](#unsafe_hashes) for more information.

To allow inline scripts and styles, `'unsafe-inline'`, a nonce-source or a hash-source that matches the inline block can be specified.
The following Content Security Policy will allow all inline {{HTMLElement("script")}} elements:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'unsafe-inline';
```

The following {{HTMLElement("script")}} element will be allowed by the policy:

```html
<script>
  const inline = 1;
  // …
</script>
```

Allowing all inline scripts is considered a security risk, so it's recommended to use a nonce-source or a hash-source instead.
To allow inline scripts and styles with a nonce-source, you need to generate a random value and include it in the policy:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'nonce-2726c7f26c'
```

Then, you need to include the same nonce in the {{HTMLElement("script")}} element:

```html
<script nonce="2726c7f26c">
  const inline = 1;
  // …
</script>
```

Alternatively, you can create hashes from your inline scripts. CSP supports sha256, sha384 and sha512.

```http
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'sha256-B2yPHKaXnvFWtRChIbabYmUBFZdVfKKXHbWtWidDVF8='
```

When generating the hash, don't include the {{HTMLElement("script")}} tags and note that capitalization and whitespace matter, including leading or trailing whitespace.

```html
<script>
  const inline = 1;
</script>
```

### Unsafe hashes

Policies for inline resources with hashes like `script-src 'sha256-{HASHED_INLINE_SCRIPT}'` allow scripts and styles by their hash, but not event handlers:

```html
<!-- Allowed by CSP: script-src 'sha256-{HASHED_INLINE_SCRIPT}' -->
<script>
  const inline = 1;
</script>

<!-- CSP: script-src 'sha256-{HASHED_EVENT_HANDLER}'
      will not allow this event handler -->
<button onclick="myScript()">Submit</button>
```

Instead of allowing `'unsafe-inline'`, you can use the `'unsafe-hashes'` source expression if code can't be updated to equivalent {{domxref("EventTarget.addEventListener", "addEventListener")}} calls.
Given a HTML page that includes the following inline event handler:

```html
<!-- I wan't to use addEventListener, but I can't :( -->
<button onclick="myScript()">Submit</button>
```

The following CSP header will allow the script to execute:

```http
Content-Security-Policy:  script-src 'unsafe-hashes' 'sha256-{HASHED_EVENT_HANDLER}'
```

### Unsafe eval expressions

The `'unsafe-eval'` source expression controls several script execution methods that create code from strings.
If a page has a CSP header and `'unsafe-eval'` isn't specified with the `script-src` directive, the following methods are blocked and won't have any effect:

- {{jsxref("Global_Objects/eval", "eval()")}}
- {{jsxref("Function", "Function()")}}
- When passing a string literal like to methods like: `setTimeout("alert(\"Hello World!\");", 500);`

  - {{domxref("setTimeout()")}}
  - {{domxref("setInterval()")}}
  - {{domxref("window.setImmediate")}}

- `window.execScript()` {{non-standard_inline}} (IE < 11 only)

### Unsafe WebAssembly execution

The `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` source expression controls WebAssembly execution.
If a page has a CSP header and `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` isn't specified in the `script-src` directive, WebAssembly is blocked from loading and executing on the page.

The `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` source expression is more specific than `'unsafe-eval'` which permits both compilation (and instantiation) of WebAssembly and, for example, the use of the `eval` operation in JavaScript.
If the `'unsafe-eval'` source keyword is used, then this overrides any occurrence of `'wasm-unsafe-eval'` in the CSP policy.

```http
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'wasm-unsafe-eval'
```

### strict-dynamic

The `'strict-dynamic'` source expression specifies that the trust explicitly given to a script present in the markup, by accompanying it with a nonce or a hash, shall be propagated to all the scripts loaded by that root script. At the same time, any allowlist or source expressions such as `'self'` or `'unsafe-inline'` will be ignored.

For example, a policy such as `script-src 'strict-dynamic' 'nonce-R4nd0m' https://allowlisted.example.com/` would allow loading of a root script with `<script nonce="R4nd0m" src="https://example.com/loader.js">` and propagate that trust to any script loaded by `loader.js`, but disallow loading scripts from `https://allowlisted.example.com/` unless accompanied by a nonce or loaded from a trusted script.

```http
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'strict-dynamic' 'nonce-someNonce'
```

Or:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'strict-dynamic' 'sha256-base64EncodedHash'
```

It is possible to deploy `strict-dynamic` in a backwards compatible way, without requiring user-agent sniffing.
The policy:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'unsafe-inline' https: 'nonce-abcdefg' 'strict-dynamic'
```

will act like `'unsafe-inline' https:` in browsers that support CSP1, `https: 'nonce-abcdefg'` in browsers that support CSP2, and `'nonce-abcdefg' 'strict-dynamic'` in browsers that support CSP3.
