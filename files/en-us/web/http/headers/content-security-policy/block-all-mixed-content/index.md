{{HTTPSidebar}}{{deprecated_header}}

> **Warning:** This directive is marked as obsolete in the specification: all mixed content is now blocked if it can't be autoupgraded.

The HTTP {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}} (CSP) **`block-all-mixed-content`** directive prevents loading any assets over HTTP when the page uses HTTPS.

All [mixed content](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content) resource requests are blocked, including both active and passive mixed content.
This also applies to {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} documents, ensuring the entire page is mixed content-free.

> **Note:** The {{CSP("upgrade-insecure-requests")}} directive is evaluated before `block-all-mixed-content`.
> If the former is set, the latter does nothing, so set one directive or the other â€“ not both, unless you want to force HTTPS on older browsers that do not force it after a redirect to HTTP.

## Syntax

```http
Content-Security-Policy: block-all-mixed-content;
```

## Examples

```http
Content-Security-Policy: block-all-mixed-content;

<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="block-all-mixed-content">
```

To disallow http assets on a more granular level, you can also set individual directives to `https:`.
For example, to disallow insecure HTTP images:

```http
Content-Security-Policy: img-src https:
```
