{{HTTPSidebar}}

The `Content-Security-Policy` **`report-to`** directive indicates the name of the endpoint that the browser should use for reporting CSP violations.

If a CSP violation occurs, a report is generated that contains a serialized version of {{domxref("CSPViolationReportBody")}}, and this is sent to the URL that corresponds with the endpoint name using the generic mechanisms defined in the [Reporting API)](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Reporting_API).

The server must separately provide the mapping between endpoint names and their corresponding URLs in the {{HTTPHeader("Reporting-Endpoints")}} HTTP response header.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">CSP version</th>
      <td>1</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Directive type</th>
      <td>{{Glossary("Reporting directive")}}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2" scope="row">
        This directive is not supported in the {{HTMLElement("meta")}} element.
      </th>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Syntax

```http
Content-Security-Policy: â€¦; report-to <endpoint_name>
```

`<endpoint_name>` is the name of an endpoint provided by the {{HTTPHeader("Reporting-Endpoints")}} HTTP response header.

> [!NOTE]
> The `<endpoint_name>` can also be the name of an group provided in the {{HTTPHeader("Report-To")}} {{deprecated_inline}} HTTP response header, but this is deprecated and should not be used.

## Examples

### Setting a CSP violation report endpoint

A server might first define the endpoint name and URL using the {{HTTPHeader("Reporting-Endpoints")}} header in the response for the resource.
Any name can be used: here we've chosen "name-of-endpoint".

```http
Reporting-Endpoints: name-of-endpoint="https://example.com/csp-reports"
```

The server can then set this endpoint as the target for sending CSP violation reports using the `report-to` directive as shown.

```http
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; report-to name-of-endpoint
```
