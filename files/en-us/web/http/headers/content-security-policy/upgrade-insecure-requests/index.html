<div>{{HTTPSidebar}}</div>

<p>The HTTP {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}} (CSP)
	<code><strong>upgrade-insecure-requests</strong></code> directive instructs user
	agents to treat all of a site's insecure URLs (those served over HTTP) as though they
	have been replaced with secure URLs (those served over HTTPS). This directive is
	intended for web sites with large numbers of insecure legacy URLs that need to be
	rewritten.</p>

<p class="note">The <code>upgrade-insecure-requests</code> directive is evaluated before
	{{CSP("block-all-mixed-content")}} and if it is set, the latter is effectively a
	no-op. It is recommended to set either directive, but not both, unless you want to
	force HTTPS on older browsers that do not force it after a redirect to HTTP.</p>

<p>The <code>upgrade-insecure-requests</code> directive will not ensure that users
	visiting your site via links on third-party sites will be upgraded to HTTPS for the
	top-level navigation and thus does not replace the
	{{HTTPHeader("Strict-Transport-Security")}} ({{Glossary("HSTS")}}) header, which
	should still be set with an appropriate <code>max-age</code> to ensure that users are
	not subject to SSL stripping attacks.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
	class="brush: html">Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests;</pre>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<pre>// header
Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests;

// meta tag
&lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="upgrade-insecure-requests"&gt;
</pre>

<p>With the above header set on a domain example.com that wants to migrate from HTTP to
	HTTPS, non-navigational insecure resource requests are automatically upgraded
	(first-party as well as third-party requests).</p>

<pre class="brush: html">&lt;img src="http://example.com/image.png"&gt;
&lt;img src="http://not-example.com/image.png"&gt;</pre>

<p>These URLs will be rewritten before the request is made, meaning that no insecure
	requests will hit the network. Note that, if the requested resource is not actually
	available via HTTPS, the request will fail without any fallback to HTTP.</p>

<pre class="brush: html">&lt;img src="https://example.com/image.png"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://not-example.com/image.png"&gt;</pre>

<p>Navigational upgrades to third-party resources brings a significantly higher potential
	for breakage, these are not upgraded:</p>

<pre class="brush: html">&lt;a href="https://example.com/"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;a href="http://not-example.com/"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;</pre>

<h3 id="Finding_insecure_requests">Finding insecure requests</h3>

<p>With the help of the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only")}} header and
	the {{CSP("report-uri")}} directive, you can set-up an enforced policy and a reported
	policy like this:</p>

<pre>Content-Security-Policy: upgrade-insecure-requests; default-src https:
Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: default-src https:; report-uri /endpoint</pre>

<p>That way, you still upgrade insecure requests on your secure site, but the only
	monitoring policy is violated and reports insecure resources to your endpoint.</p>
