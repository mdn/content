{{HTTPSidebar}}

The HTTP {{HTTPHeader("Permissions-Policy")}} header `fullscreen` directive controls whether the current document is allowed to use {{domxref('Element.requestFullscreen()')}}.

By default, top-level documents and their same-origin child frames can request and enter fullscreen mode. This directive allows or prevents cross-origin frames from using fullscreen mode. This includes same-origin frames.

Specifically, where a defined policy blocks use of this feature, {{domxref('Element.requestFullscreen', "requestFullscreen()")}} calls will return a {{jsxref('Promise')}} that rejects with a {{jsxref('TypeError')}}.

> **Note:** If both this directive (i.e. via the `allow` attribute) and the `allowfullscreen` attribute are present on an `<iframe>` element, this directive takes precedence.

## Syntax

```http
Permissions-Policy: fullscreen=<allowlist>;
```

- `<allowlist>`
  - : A list of origins for which permission is granted to use the feature. See [`Permissions-Policy` > Syntax](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Permissions-Policy#syntax) for more details.

## Default policy

The default allowlist for `fullscreen` is `self`.

## Examples

### General example

SecureCorp Inc. wants to disable the Fullscreen API within all browsing contexts except for its own origin and those whose origin is `https://example.com`. It can do so by delivering the following HTTP response header to define a Permissions Policy:

```http
Permissions-Policy: fullscreen=(self "https://example.com")
```

### With an \<iframe> element

FastCorp Inc. wants to disable `fullscreen` for all cross-origin child frames, except for a specific `<iframe>`. It can do so by delivering the following HTTP response header to define a Permissions Policy:

```http
Permissions-Policy: fullscreen=(self)
```

Then include an {{HTMLElement('iframe','allow','#Attributes')}} attribute on the `<iframe>` element:

```html
<iframe src="https://other.com/videoplayer" allow="fullscreen"></iframe>
```

iframe attributes can selectively enable features in certain frames, and not in others, even if those frames contain documents from the same origin.
