<div class="note">
  <p>The <code>Permissions-Policy</code> header was previously named <code>Feature-Policy</code>. As of June 2021, the {{domxref('FeaturePolicy')}} API  as well as some linked-to articles and demos still use the older name.</p>
</div>

<p>This Permissions Policy directive was at one point defined as
<code>xr</code> (but implemented in Chrome as
{{httpheader("Permissions-Policy/vr", "vr")}}),
use {{httpheader("Permissions-Policy/xr-spatial-tracking",
"xr-spatial-tracking")}} instead.</p>
