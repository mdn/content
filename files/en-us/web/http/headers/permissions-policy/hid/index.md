{{HTTPSidebar}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The HTTP {{HTTPHeader("Permissions-Policy")}} header `hid` directive controls whether the current document is allowed to use the {{domxref("WebHID API", "WebHID API", "", "nocode")}} to connect to uncommon or exotic human interface devices such as alternative keyboards or gamepads.

Specifically, where a defined policy blocks WebHID usage, the {{domxref("Navigator.hid")}} property will not be available.

## Syntax

Permissions-Policy: hid=<allowlist>;
```
