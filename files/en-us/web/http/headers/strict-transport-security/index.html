<p>The <strong>HTTP <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code></strong> response header (often
  abbreviated as {{Glossary("HSTS")}}) lets a web site tell browsers that it should only
  be accessed using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP.</p>

<h2 id="Description">Description</h2>

<p>If a website accepts a connection through HTTP and redirects to HTTPS, visitors may
  initially communicate with the non-encrypted version of the site before being
  redirected, if, for example, the visitor types http://www.foo.com/ or even just foo.com.
  This creates an opportunity for a man-in-the-middle attack. The redirect could be
  exploited to direct visitors to a malicious site instead of the secure version of the
  original site.</p>

<p>The HTTP Strict Transport Security header informs the browser that it should never load
  a site using HTTP and should automatically convert all attempts to access the site using
  HTTP to HTTPS requests instead.</p>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> header
  is <strong>ignored</strong> by the browser when your site is accessed using HTTP; this
  is because an attacker may intercept HTTP connections and inject the header or remove
  it. When your site is accessed over HTTPS with no certificate errors, the browser knows
  your site is HTTPS capable and will honor the <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code>
  header.</div>

<h3 id="An_example_scenario">An example scenario</h3>

<p>You log into a free WiFi access point at an airport and start surfing the web, visiting
  your online banking service to check your balance and pay a couple of bills.
  Unfortunately, the access point you're using is actually a hacker's laptop, and they're
  intercepting your original HTTP request and redirecting you to a clone of your bank's
  site instead of the real thing. Now your private data is exposed to the hacker.</p>

<p>Strict Transport Security resolves this problem; as long as you've accessed your bank's
  web site once using HTTPS, and the bank's web site uses Strict Transport Security, your
  browser will know to automatically use only HTTPS, which prevents hackers from
  performing this sort of man-in-the-middle attack.</p>

<h3 id="How_the_browser_handles_it">How the browser handles it</h3>

<p>The first time your site is accessed using HTTPS and it returns the
  <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> header, the browser records this information, so
  that future attempts to load the site using HTTP will automatically use HTTPS instead.
</p>

<p>When the expiration time specified by the Strict-Transport-Security header elapses, the
  next attempt to load the site via HTTP will proceed as normal instead of automatically
  using HTTPS.</p>

<p>Whenever the Strict-Transport-Security header is delivered to the browser, it will
  update the expiration time for that site, so sites can refresh this information and
  prevent the timeout from expiring. Should it be necessary to disable Strict Transport
  Security, setting the max-age to 0 (over a https connection) will immediately expire the
  <code>Strict-Transport-Security</code> header, allowing access via http.</p>

<h2 id="Preloading_Strict_Transport_Security">Preloading Strict Transport Security</h2>

<p>Google maintains <a href="https://hstspreload.org/">an HSTS preload service</a>. By
  following the guidelines and successfully submitting your domain, browsers will never
  connect to your domain using an insecure connection. While the service is hosted by
  Google, all browsers have stated an intent to use (or actually started using) the
  preload list. However, it is not part of the HSTS specification and should not be
  treated as official.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Information regarding the HSTS preload list in Chrome : <a
      href="https://www.chromium.org/hsts">https://www.chromium.org/hsts</a></li>
  <li>Consultation of the Firefox HSTS preload list : <a

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>All present and future subdomains will be HTTPS for a max-age of 1 year. This blocks
  access to pages or sub domains that can only be served over HTTP.</p>

<pre>Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains</pre>

<p>In the following example, <code>max-age</code> is set to 2 years, raised from what was
  a former limit <code>max-age</code> of 1 year. Note that 1 year is acceptable for a
  domain to be included in browsers' HSTS preload lists. 2 years is, however, the
  recommended goal as a website's final HSTS configuration as explained on <a
    href="https://hstspreload.org">https://hstspreload.org</a>. It also suffixed with
  <code>preload</code> which is necessary for inclusion in most major web browsers' HSTS
  preload lists, e.g. Chromium, Edge, &amp; Firefox.</p>

<pre>Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload</pre>
