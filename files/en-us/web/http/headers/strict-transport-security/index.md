The **HTTP `Strict-Transport-Security`** response header (often
abbreviated as {{Glossary("HSTS")}}) lets a web site tell browsers that it should only
be accessed using HTTPS, instead of using HTTP.

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Header type</th>
      <td>{{Glossary("Response header")}}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">{{Glossary("Forbidden header name")}}</th>
      <td>no</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Syntax

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; includeSubDomains
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=<expire-time>; preload
```

## Directives

- `max-age=<expire-time>`
  - : The time, in seconds, that the browser should remember that a site is only to be
    accessed using HTTPS.
- `includeSubDomains` {{optional_inline}}
  - : If this optional parameter is specified, this rule applies to all of the site's
    subdomains as well.
- `preload` {{optional_inline}}
  - : See {{anch("Preloading Strict Transport Security")}} for details. Not part of the
    specification.

## Description

If a website accepts a connection through HTTP and redirects to HTTPS, visitors may
initially communicate with the non-encrypted version of the site before being
redirected, if, for example, the visitor types http\://www\.foo.com/ or even just foo.com.
This creates an opportunity for a man-in-the-middle attack. The redirect could be
exploited to direct visitors to a malicious site instead of the secure version of the
original site.

The HTTP Strict Transport Security header informs the browser that it should never load
a site using HTTP and should automatically convert all attempts to access the site using
HTTP to HTTPS requests instead.

> **Note:** The `Strict-Transport-Security` header
> is **ignored** by the browser when your site is accessed using HTTP; this
> is because an attacker may intercept HTTP connections and inject the header or remove
> it. When your site is accessed over HTTPS with no certificate errors, the browser knows
> your site is HTTPS capable and will honor the `Strict-Transport-Security`
> header.

### An example scenario

You log into a free WiFi access point at an airport and start surfing the web, visiting
your online banking service to check your balance and pay a couple of bills.
Unfortunately, the access point you're using is actually a hacker's laptop, and they're
intercepting your original HTTP request and redirecting you to a clone of your bank's
site instead of the real thing. Now your private data is exposed to the hacker.

Strict Transport Security resolves this problem; as long as you've accessed your bank's
web site once using HTTPS, and the bank's web site uses Strict Transport Security, your
browser will know to automatically use only HTTPS, which prevents hackers from
performing this sort of man-in-the-middle attack.

### How the browser handles it

The first time your site is accessed using HTTPS and it returns the
`Strict-Transport-Security` header, the browser records this information, so
that future attempts to load the site using HTTP will automatically use HTTPS instead.

When the expiration time specified by the Strict-Transport-Security header elapses, the
next attempt to load the site via HTTP will proceed as normal instead of automatically
using HTTPS.

Whenever the Strict-Transport-Security header is delivered to the browser, it will
update the expiration time for that site, so sites can refresh this information and
prevent the timeout from expiring. Should it be necessary to disable Strict Transport
Security, setting the max-age to 0 (over an https connection) will immediately expire the
`Strict-Transport-Security` header, allowing access via http.

## Preloading Strict Transport Security

Google maintains [an HSTS preload service](https://hstspreload.org/). By
following the guidelines and successfully submitting your domain, browsers will never
connect to your domain using an insecure connection. While the service is hosted by
Google, all browsers have stated an intent to use (or actually started using) the
preload list. However, it is not part of the HSTS specification and should not be
treated as official.

- Information regarding the HSTS preload list in Chrome : <https://www.chromium.org/hsts>
- Consultation of the Firefox HSTS preload list : [nsSTSPreloadList.inc](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/tip/security/manager/ssl/nsSTSPreloadList.inc)

## Examples

All present and future subdomains will be HTTPS for a `max-age` of 1 year. This blocks
access to pages or subdomains that can only be served over HTTP.

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains
```
If a `max-age` of 1 year is acceptable for a domain,
however, two years is the recommended value as explained on <https://hstspreload.org>.

In the following example, `max-age` is set to 2 years, and is suffixed with
`preload`, which is necessary for inclusion in most major web browsers' HSTS
preload lists, like Chromium, Edge, and Firefox.

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload
```
