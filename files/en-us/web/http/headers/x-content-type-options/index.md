The **`X-Content-Type-Options`** response HTTP header is a
marker used by the server to indicate that the [MIME types](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) advertised in the
{{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} headers should be followed and not be changed. The header allows you to avoid [MIME type
sniffing](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types#mime_sniffing) by saying that the MIME types are deliberately
configured.

This header was introduced by Microsoft in IE 8 as a way forÂ webmasters to block
content sniffing that was happening and could transform non-executable MIME types into
executable MIME types. Since then, other browsers have introduced it, even if their MIME
sniffing algorithms were less aggressive.

Starting with Firefox 72, top-level
documents also avoid MIME sniffing (if {{HTTPHeader("Content-type")}} is provided). This can cause HTML web pages
to be downloaded instead of being rendered when they are served with a MIME type other
than `text/html`. Make sure to set both headers correctly.

Site security testers usually expect this header to be set.
