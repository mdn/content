{{HTTPSidebar}}

The **`Accept-Post`** response HTTP header advertises which [media types](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) are accepted by the server for HTTP post requests.

**`Accept-Post`** in response to any method means that `POST` is allowed on the requested resource (any document/media format in the header further indicates that the document format is allowed).

For example, a server receiving a `POST` request with an unsupported media type could reply with {{HTTPStatus("415")}} `Unsupported Media Type` and an **`Accept-Post`** header referencing one or more supported media types.

## Syntax

```http
Accept-Post: <MIME_type>/<MIME_subtype>
Accept-Post: <MIME_type>/*
Accept-Post: */*
```

> **Note:** The `Accept-Post` header specifies a media range in the same way as {{HTTPHeader("Accept")}}, except that it has no notion of preference (i.e., no `q` arguments). This is because `Accept-Post` is a response header while `Accept` is a request header.

## Directives

None.

## Examples

```http
Accept-Post: application/example, text/example
Accept-Post: image/webp
Accept-Post: */*
```

## Browser compatibility

Browser compatibility is not relevant for this header (header is sent by server, and the specification does not define client behavior).
