The **`Sec-CH-UA-Mobile`** [user agent client hint](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client_hints#user-agent_client_hints) request header indicates whether the browser is on a mobile device.
It can also be used by a desktop browser to indicate a preference for a "mobile" user experience.

`Sec-CH-UA-Mobile` is a [low entropy hint](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client_hints#low_entropy_hints).
Unless blocked by a user agent permission policy, it is sent by default, without the server opting in by sending {{HTTPHeader("Accept-CH")}}.
