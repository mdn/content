<p>The <strong><code>If-None-Match</code></strong> HTTP request header makes the request conditional. For {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} and {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}} methods, the server will send back the requested resource, with a {{HTTPStatus("200")}} status, only if it doesn't have an {{HTTPHeader("ETag")}} matching the given ones. For other methods, the request will be processed only if the eventually existing resource's {{HTTPHeader("ETag")}} doesn't match any of the values listed.</p>

<p>When the condition fails for {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} and {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}} methods, then the server must return HTTP status code 304 (Not Modified). For methods that apply server-side changes, the status code 412 (Precondition Failed) is used. Note that the server generating a 304 response MUST generate any of the following header fields that would have been sent in a 200 (OK) response to the same request: Cache-Control, Content-Location, Date, ETag, Expires, and Vary.</p>

<p>The comparison with the stored {{HTTPHeader("ETag")}} uses the <em>weak comparison algorithm</em>, meaning two files are considered identical if the content is equivalent — they don't have to be identical byte for byte. For example, two pages that differ by the date of generation in the footer would still be considered as identical.</p>

<p>When used in combination with {{HTTPHeader("If-Modified-Since")}}, <strong><code>If-None-Match</code></strong> has precedence (if the server supports it).</p>

<p>There are two common use cases:</p>

<ul>
 <li>For {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} and {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}} methods, to update a cached entity that has an associated {{HTTPHeader("ETag")}}.</li>
 <li>For other methods, and in particular for {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}}, <code>If-None-Match</code> used with the <code>*</code> value can be used to save a file not known to exist, guaranteeing that another upload didn't happen before, losing the data of the previous put; this problem is a variation of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/1999/04/Editing/#3.1">lost update problem</a>.</li>
</ul>

 <dd>Entity tags uniquely representing the requested resources. They are a string of ASCII characters placed between double quotes (Like <code>"675af34563dc-tr34"</code>) and may be prefixed by <code>W/</code> to indicate that the weak comparison algorithm should be used (This is useless with <code>If-None-Match</code> as it only uses that algorithm).</dd>
 <dt><code>*</code></dt>
 <dd>The asterisk is a special value representing any resource. They are only useful when uploading a resource, usually with {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}}, to check if another resource with the identity has already been uploaded before.</dd>
