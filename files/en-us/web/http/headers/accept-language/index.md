{{HTTPSidebar}}

The **`Accept-Language`** request HTTP header indicates the natural language and locale that the client prefers.
The server uses [content negotiation](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation) to select one of the proposals and informs the client of the choice with the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Language")}} response header.
Browsers set required values for this header according to their active user interface language.
Users can also configure additional preferred languages through browser settings.

The `Accept-Language` header generally lists the same locales as the {{domxref("navigator.languages")}} property, with decreasing `q` values (quality values). Some browsers (Chrome and Safari) add language-only fallback tags in `Accept-Language`â€”for example, `en-US,en;q=0.9,zh-CN;q=0.8,zh;q=0.7` when `navigator.languages` is `["en-US", "zh-CN"]`. For privacy purposes (reducing {{Glossary("fingerprinting")}}), both `Accept-Language` and `navigator.languages` may not include the full list of user preferences, such as in Safari (always) and Chrome's incognito mode, where only one language is listed.

This header serves as a hint when the server cannot determine the target content language otherwise (for example, use a specific URL that depends on an explicit user decision).
The server should never override an explicit user language choice. The content of `Accept-Language` is often out of a user's control (when traveling, for instance).
A user may also want to visit a page in a language different from the user interface language.

The server possibly can send back a {{HTTPStatus("406")}} (Not Acceptable) error code when unable to serve content in a matching language.
However, such a behavior is rarely implemented for a better user experience, and servers often ignore the `Accept-Language` header in such cases.

## Syntax

```http
Accept-Language: <language>
Accept-Language: *

// Multiple types, weighted with the quality value syntax:
Accept-Language: fr-CH, fr;q=0.9, en;q=0.8, de;q=0.7, *;q=0.5
```

## Directives

- `<language>`
  - : A language tag (which is sometimes referred to as a "locale identifier").
    This consists of a 2-3 letter base language tag that indicates a language, optionally followed by additional subtags separated by `'-'`.
    The most common extra information is the country or region variant (like `'en-US'` or `'fr-CA'`) or the type of alphabet to use (like `'sr-Latn'`).
    Other variants, like the type of orthography (`'de-DE-1996'`), are usually not used in the context of this header.
- `*`
  - : Any language; `'*'` is used as a wildcard.
- `;q=` (q-factor weighting)
  - : Any value placed in an order of preference expressed using a relative {{glossary("Quality values", "quality value")}} called _weight_.

## Examples

```http
Accept-Language: de
```

```http
Accept-Language: de-CH
```

```http
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
```
