The **`Viewport-Width`** [device client hint](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Client_hints) request header provides the client's layout viewport width in {{Glossary("CSS pixel","CSS pixels")}}. The value is rounded up to the smallest following integer (i.e. ceiling value).

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Header type</th>
      <td>
        {{Glossary("Request header")}},
        {{Glossary("Client hints","Client hint")}}
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">{{Glossary("Forbidden header name")}}</th>
      <td>no</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The hint can be used with other screen-specific hints to deliver images optimized for a specific screen size, or to omit resources that are not needed for a particular screen width.

If the `Viewport-Width` header appears more than once in a message the last occurrence is used.

> **Note:**
>
> - Client Hints are accessible only on secure origins (via TLS).
> - A server has to opt in to receive the `Viewport-Width` header from the client, by sending the {{HTTPHeader("Accept-CH")}} response header.
> - Servers that opt in to the `Viewport-Width` client hint will typically also specify it in the {{HTTPHeader("Vary")}} header. This informs caches that the server may send different responses based on the header value in a request.
> - `Viewport-Width` was removed from the original client hints specification in [draft-ietf-httpbis-client-hints-07](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-hints-07). The proposed replacement is [`Sec-CH-Viewport-Width`](https://wicg.github.io/responsive-image-client-hints/#sec-ch-viewport-width) (Responsive Image Client Hints).

## Syntax

```
Viewport-Width: <number>
```

## Directives

- \<number>
  - : The width of the user's viewport in {{Glossary("CSS pixel","CSS pixels")}}, rounded up to the nearest integer.

## Examples

A server must first opt in to receive the `Viewport-Width` header by sending the response header {{HTTPHeader("Accept-CH")}} containing the directive `Viewport-Width`.

```
Accept-CH: Viewport-Width
```

Then on subsequent requests the client might send `Viewport-Width` header back:

```
Viewport-Width: 320
```
