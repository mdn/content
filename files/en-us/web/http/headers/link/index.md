The HTTP **`Link`** [entity header](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Entity_header) field provides a means for serializing one or more links in HTTP headers. This header has the same semantics as the HTML {{HTMLElement("link")}} element. The benefit of using the `Link` header is that the browser can start preconnecting or preloading resources before the HTML itself is fetched and processed.

In practice, most [`rel` link types](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel) don't have an effect when used with the HTTP header. For example, the `icon` relation only works in HTML, and `stylesheet` does not work reliably across browsers (only in Firefox).
The only relations that work reliably are [`preconnect`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preconnect) and [`preload`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preload), which can be combined with {{HTTPStatus(103, "103 Early Hints")}}.

## Syntax

```http
Link: <uri-reference>; param1=value1; param2="value2"
```

- `<uri-reference>`
  - : The URI reference, must be enclosed between `<` and `>` and {{Glossary("Percent-encoding", "percent-encoded")}}.

### Parameters

The link header contains parameters, which are separated with `;` and are equivalent to attributes of the {{HTMLElement("link")}} element.

## Examples

### Enclose URLs in angle brackets

The URI (absolute or relative) must be enclosed between `<` and `>`:

```http example-good
Link: <https://example.com>; rel="preconnect"
```

```http example-bad
Link: https://bad.example; rel="preconnect"
```

### Encoding URLs

The URI (absolute or relative) must encode char codes greater than 255:

```http example-good
Link: <https://example.com/%E8%8B%97%E6%9D%A1>; rel="preconnect"
```

```http example-bad
Link: <https://example.com/苗条>; rel="preconnect"
```

### Specifying multiple links

You can specify multiple links separated by commas, for example:

```http
Link: <https://one.example.com>; rel="preconnect", <https://two.example.com>; rel="preconnect", <https://three.example.com>; rel="preconnect"
```

### Controlling fetch priority

Even when using [`preload`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/preload) to fetch a resource as early as possible, different types of content will be fetched earlier or later based on the browser's internal prioritization.
The [`fetchpriority`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#fetchpriority) attribute can be used to hint to the browser that a particular resource will have a greater or lesser relative impact on user experience than other resources of the same type.

For example, the header below might be used to preload `style.css` with a higher priority than other stylesheets:

```http
Link: </style.css>; rel=preload; as=style; fetchpriority="high"
```

Note that both the internal prioritization for fetching resources and the effect of the `fetchpriority` directive are browser-dependent.
The `fetchpriority` directive should be used sparingly, and only in cases where a browser cannot infer that a particular resource should be treated with a different priority.
