The HTTP {{HTTPHeader('Feature-Policy')}} header `unsized-media` directive controls whether the current document is allowed to change the size ofÂ media elements after the initial layout is complete.

This restriction solves "layout instability" problem caused by providing default dimensions for images whose size is not specified in advance so that image doesn't change size after loading.

## Syntax

```
Feature-Policy: unsized-media <allowlist>;
```

- \<allowlist>
  - : A list of origins for which the feature is allowed. See [`Feature-Policy`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Feature-Policy#syntax).

## Default value

The default value for unsized-media is `'*'`, that is unsized media elements are allowed for all origins by default. The page will re-flow every time an image with unknown dimensions is loaded.

## Browser compatibility

{{Compat}}
