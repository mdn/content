<p>HTTP allows a browser, or another {{Glossary("user agent")}}, toÂ communicate with different <em>resources</em> on the Internet: to do this the browser needs both the <em>identity</em> and the <em>location</em> of the resources. These two bits of information are described by a {{glossary("URI")}}.</p>
