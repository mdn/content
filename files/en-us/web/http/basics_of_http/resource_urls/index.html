<p>Resource URLs, URLs prefixed with the <code>resource:</code> scheme, are used by
  Firefox and Firefox browser extensions to load resources internally, but some of the
  information is available to sites the browser connects to as well.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<p>Resource URLs are composed of two parts: a prefix (<code>resource:</code>), and a URL
  pointing to the resource you want to load:</p>

<pre class="brush: html">resource://&lt;url&gt;</pre>

<p>An example:</p>

<pre>resource://gre/res/svg.css</pre>

<p>When arrows are found in the resource URL's ('-&gt;'), it means that the first file
  loaded the next one:</p>

<pre>resource://&lt;File-loader&gt; -&gt; &lt;File-loaded&gt;</pre>

<p>Please refer to <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Identifying_resources_on_the_Web">Identifying
    resources on the web</a> for more general details.</p>

<p>In this article, we focus on resource URIs, which are used internally by Firefox to
  point to built-in resources.</p>

<h2 id="Threats">Threats</h2>

<p>Because some of the information shared by <code>resource:</code> URLs is available to
  websites, a web page could run internal scripts and inspect internal resources of
  Firefox, including the default preferences, which could be a serious security and
  privacy issue.</p>

<p>For example, <a href="https://www.browserleaks.com/firefox">a script on
    Browserleaks</a> highlights what Firefox reveals when queried by a simple script
  running on the site (you can find the code in <a
    href="https://browserleaks.com/firefox#more">https://browserleaks.com/firefox#more</a>).
</p>

<p>The file firefox.js passes preference names and values to the pref() function. For
  example:</p>

<pre><a href="http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/48ea452803907f2575d81021e8678634e8067fc2/browser/app/profile/firefox.js#575">http://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/rev/48ea452803907f2575d81021e8678634e8067fc2/browser/app/profile/firefox.js#575</a></pre>

<p>Web sites can easily collect Firefox default preferences by overriding this
  <code>pref()</code> function and using the script
  <code>resource:///defaults/preferences/firefox.js</code>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, some default values of preferences differ between build configurations,
  such as platform and locale, which means web sites could identify individual users using
  this information.</p>

<h2 id="Solution">Solution</h2>

<p>In order to fix this problem, Mozilla changed the behavior of loading resource: URIs in
  {{bug(863246)}}, which landed in <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/57">Firefox 57 (Quantum)</a>.</p>

<p>In the past, web content was able to access whatever <code>resource:</code> URIs were
  desired — not only Firefox’s internal resources, but also extensions’ assets.  Now this
  behavior is prohibited by default.</p>

<p>It is however still necessary for Firefox to load resources in web content under
  certain circumstances.  For example, if you open the view source page (View Page Source
  or View Selection Source), you will find it requires <code>viewsource.css</code> through
  a <code>resource:</code> URI.  Resources that have to be exposed to web content have
  been moved to a new location named <code>resource://content-accessible/</code>, which is
  isolated and only contains non-sensitive resources.  In this way we can keep essential
  resources exposed and have most threats eliminated.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: It is recommended that web and extension developers don’t try
    to use resource URLs anymore. Their usage was hacky at best, and most usage won’t work
    any more.</p>
