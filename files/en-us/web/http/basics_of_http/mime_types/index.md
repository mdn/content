A **media type** (also known as a
**Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions or MIME type**) is a standard
that indicates the nature and format of a document, file, or assortment of
bytes. It is defined and standardized in IETF's {{RFC(6838)}}.

The [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)](https://www.iana.org/) is
responsible for all official MIME types, and you can find the most up-to-date and
complete list at their [Media Types](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml)
page.

> **Warning:** Browsers use the MIME type,

## Structure of a MIME type

The simplest MIME type consists of a _type_ and a _subtype_; these
are each strings which, when concatenated with a slash (`/`) between them,
comprise a MIME type. No whitespace is allowed in a MIME type:

```
type/subtype
```

The **_type_** represents the general category into which the
data type falls, such as `video` or `text`. The
**_subtype_** identifies the exact kind of data of the specified
type the MIME type represents. For example, for the MIME type `text`, the
subtype might be `plain` (plain text), `html`
({{Glossary("HTML")}} source code), or `calendar` (for
iCalendar/`.ics`) files.

Each type has its own set of possible subtypes, and a MIME type always has both a type
and a subtype, never just one or the other.

An optional **parameter** can be added to provide additional details:

```
type/subtype;parameter=value
```

For example, for any MIME type whose main type is `text`, the optional
`charset` parameter can be used to specify the character set used for the
characters in the data. If no `charset` is specified, the default is
{{Glossary("ASCII")}} (`US-ASCII`) unless overridden by the {{Glossary("user
  agent", "user agent's")}} settings. To specify a UTF-8 text file, the MIME type
`text/plain;charset=UTF-8` is used.

MIME types are case-insensitive but are traditionally written in lowercase, with the
exception of parameter values, whose case may or may not have specific meaning.

### Types

There are two classes of type: **discrete** and
**multipart**. Discrete types are types which represent a single file or
medium, such as a single text or music file, or a single video. A multipart type is one
which represents a document that's comprised of multiple component parts, each of which
may have its own individual MIME type; or, a multipart type may encapsulate multiple
files being sent together in one transaction. For example, multipart MIME types are used
when attaching multiple files to an email.

#### Discrete types

The discrete types currently registered with the IANA are:

- `application`
  - : Any kind of binary data that doesn't fall explicitly into one of the other types;
    either data that will be executed or interpreted in some way or binary data that
    requires a specific application or category of application to use. Generic binary data
    (or binary data whose true type is unknown) is `application/octet-stream`.
    Other common examples include `application/pdf`,
    `application/pkcs8`, and `application/zip`.
    [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#application)
- `audio`
  - : Audio or music data. Examples include `audio/mpeg`,
    `audio/vorbis`.
    [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#audio)
- `example`
  - : Reserved for use as a placeholder in examples showing how to use MIME types. These
    should never be used outside of sample code listings and documentation.
    `example` can also be used as a subtype; for instance, in an example
    related to working with audio on the web, the MIME type `audio/example` can
    be used to indicate that the type is a placeholder and should be replaced with an
    appropriate one when using the code in the real world.
- `font`
  - : Font/typeface data. Common examples include `font/woff`,
    `font/ttf`, and `font/otf`.
    [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#font)
- `image`
  - : Image or graphical data including both bitmap and vector still images as well as
    animated versions of still image formats such as animated {{Glossary("GIF")}} or APNG.
    Common examples are `image/jpeg`, `image/png`, and
    `image/svg+xml`.
    [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#image)
- `model`
  - : Model data for a 3D object or scene. Examples include `model/3mf` and
    `model/vrml`.
    [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#model)
- `text`
  - : Text-only data including any human-readable content, source code, or textual data
    such as comma-separated value (CSV) formatted data. Examples include
    `text/plain`, `text/csv`, and `text/html`.
    [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#text)
- `video`
  - : Video data or files, such as MP4 movies (`video/mp4`).
    [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#video)

For text documents without a specific subtype, `text/plain` should be used.
Similarly, for binary documents without a specific or known subtype,
`application/octet-stream` should be used.

#### Multipart types

**Multipart** types indicate a category of document broken into
pieces, often with different MIME types; they can also be used — especially in email
scenarios — to represent multiple, separate files which are all part of the same
transaction. They represent a **composite document**.

With the exception of `multipart/form-data`, used in
the {{HTTPMethod("POST")}} method of [HTML
Forms](/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms), and `multipart/byteranges`, used with {{HTTPStatus("206")}}
`Partial Content` to send part of a document, HTTP doesn't handle multipart
documents in a special way: the message is transmitted to the browser (which will likely
show a "Save As" window if it doesn't know how to display the document).

There are two multipart types:

- `message`
  - : A message that encapsulates other messages. This can be used, for instance, to
    represent an email that includes a forwarded message as part of its data, or to allow
    sending very large messages in chunks as if it were multiple messages. Examples
    include `message/rfc822` (for forwarded or replied-to message quoting) and
    `message/partial` to allow breaking a large message into smaller ones
    automatically to be reassembled by the recipient.
    [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#message)
- `multipart`
  - : Data that is comprised of multiple components which may individually have different
    MIME types. Examples include `multipart/form-data` (for data produced using
    the {{domxref("FormData")}} API) and `multipart/byteranges` (defined in
    {{RFC(7233, "5.4.1")}} and used with {{Glossary("HTTP")}}'s {{HTTPStatus(206)}}
    "Partial Content" response returned when the fetched data is only part of the content,
    such as is delivered using the {{HTTPHeader("Range")}} header).
    [(Registration at IANA)](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml#multipart)

## Important MIME types for Web developers

### application/octet-stream

This is the default for binary files. As it means _unknown binary_ file,
browsers usually don't execute it, or even ask if it should be executed. They treat it
as if the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Disposition")}} header was set to
`attachment`, and propose a "Save As" dialog.

### text/plain

This is the default for textual files. Even if it really means "unknown textual file,"
browsers assume they can display it.

> **Note:** `text/plain` does not mean "any kind of textual data." If they
> expect a specific kind of textual data, they will likely not consider it a match.
> Specifically if they download a `text/plain` file from a
> {{HTMLElement("link")}} element declaring a CSS file, they will not recognize it as a
> valid CSS file if presented with `text/plain`. The CSS mime type
> `text/css` must be used.

### text/css

CSS files used to style a Web page **must** be sent with
`text/css`. If a server doesn't recognize the `.css` suffix for
CSS files, it may send them with `text/plain` or
`application/octet-stream` MIME types. If so, they won't be recognized as CSS
by most browsers and will be ignored.

### text/html

All HTML content should be served with this type. Alternative MIME types for XHTML
(like `application/xhtml+xml`) are mostly useless nowadays.

> **Note:** Use `application/xml` or
> `application/xhtml+xml` if you want XML's strict parsing rules,
> [`<![CDATA[…]]>`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CDATASection)
> sections, or elements that aren't from HTML/SVG/MathML namespaces.

### text/javascript

Per the HTML specification, JavaScript files should always be served using the MIME
type `text/javascript`. No other values are considered valid, and using any
of those may result in scripts that do not load or run.

For historical reasons, the [MIME Sniffing
Standard](https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/) (the definition of how browsers should interpret media types and figure
out what to do with content that doesn't have a valid one) allows JavaScript to be
served using any MIME type that essentially matches any of the following:

- `application/javascript`
- `application/ecmascript`
- `application/x-ecmascript` {{Non-standard_Inline}}
- `application/x-javascript` {{Non-standard_Inline}}
- `text/javascript`
- `text/ecmascript`
- `text/javascript1.0` {{Non-standard_Inline}}
- `text/javascript1.1` {{Non-standard_Inline}}
- `text/javascript1.2` {{Non-standard_Inline}}
- `text/javascript1.3` {{Non-standard_Inline}}
- `text/javascript1.4` {{Non-standard_Inline}}
- `text/javascript1.5` {{Non-standard_Inline}}
- `text/jscript` {{Non-standard_Inline}}
- `text/livescript` {{Non-standard_Inline}}
- `text/x-ecmascript` {{Non-standard_Inline}}
- `text/x-javascript` {{Non-standard_Inline}}

> **Note:** Even though any given {{Glossary("user agent")}} may support
> any or all of these, you should only use `text/javascript`. It's the only
> MIME type guaranteed to work now and into the future.

Some content you find may have a `charset` parameter at the end of the
`text/javascript` media type, to specify the character set used to represent
the code's content. This is not valid, and in most cases will result in a script not
being loaded.

### Image types

Files whose MIME type is `image` contain image data. The subtype specifies
which specific image file format the data represents. Only a few image types are used
commonly enough to be considered safe for use on web pages:

{{page("en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types", "table-of-image-file-types")}}

### Audio and video types

As is the case for images, HTML doesn't mandate that web browsers support any specific
file and codec types for the {{HTMLElement("audio")}} and {{HTMLElement("video")}}
elements, so it's important to consider your target audience and the range of browsers
(and versions of those browsers) they may be using when choosing the file type and
codecs to use for media.

Our [media container formats
guide](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Containers) provides a list of the file types that are commonly supported by web
browsers, including information about what their special use cases may be, any drawbacks
they have, and compatibility information, along with other details.

The [audio codec](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Audio_codecs) and [video codec](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Video_codecs) guides list the
various codecs that web browsers often support, providing compatibility details along
with technical information such as how many audio channels they support, what sort of
compression is used, and what bit rates and so forth they're useful at. The [codecs used by WebRTC](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/WebRTC_codecs) guide
expands upon this by specifically covering the codecs supported by the major web
browsers, so you can choose the codecs that best cover the range of browsers you wish to
support.

As for MIME types of audio or video files, they typically specify the container format
(file type). The optional [codecs parameter](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/codecs_parameter) can be
added to the MIME type to further specify which codecs to use and what options were used
to encode the media, such as codec profile, level, or other such information.

The most commonly used MIME types used for web content are listed below. This isn't a
complete list of all the types that may be available, however. See the [media container formats](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Containers) guide for
that.

| MIME type                                               | Audio or video type                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `audio/wave` `audio/wav` `audio/x-wav` `audio/x-pn-wav` | An audio file in the WAVE container format. The PCM audio codec (WAVE codec "1") is often supported, but other codecs have limited support (if any).                                    |
| `audio/webm`                                            | An audio file in the WebM container format. Vorbis and Opus are the codecs officially supported by the WebM specification.                                                              |
| `video/webm`                                            | A video file, possibly with audio, in the WebM container format. VP8 and VP9 are the most common video codecs; Vorbis and Opus the most common audio codecs.                            |
| `audio/ogg`                                             | An audio file in the Ogg container format. Vorbis is the most common audio codec used in such a container; however, Opus is now supported by Ogg as well.                               |
| `video/ogg`                                             | A video file, possibly with audio, in the Ogg container format. Theora is the usual video codec used within it; Vorbis is the usual audio codec, although Opus is becoming more common. |
| `application/ogg`                                       | An audio or video file using the Ogg container format. Theora is the usual video codec used within it; Vorbis is the usual audio codec.                                                 |

### multipart/form-data

The `multipart/form-data` type can be used when sending the values of a
completed [HTML Form](/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms) from browser to
server.

As a multipart document format, it consists of different parts, delimited by a boundary
(a string starting with a double dash `--`). Each part is its own entity with
its own HTTP headers, {{HTTPHeader("Content-Disposition")}}, and
{{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} for file uploading fields.

```
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=aBoundaryString
(other headers associated with the multipart document as a whole)

--aBoundaryString
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="myFile"; filename="img.jpg"
Content-Type: image/jpeg

(data)
--aBoundaryString
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="myField"

(data)
--aBoundaryString
(more subparts)
--aBoundaryString--
```

The following `<form>`:

```html
<form action="http://localhost:8000/" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <label>Name: <input name="myTextField" value="Test"></label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="myCheckBox"> Check</label>
  <label>Upload file: <input type="file" name="myFile" value="test.txt"></label>
  <button>Send the file</button>
</form>
```

will send this message:

```

```

### multipart/byteranges

The `multipart/byteranges` MIME type is used to send partial responses to
the browser.

When the {{HTTPStatus("206", "206 Partial Content")}} status code is sent, this
MIME type indicates that the document is composed of several parts, one for each of the
requested ranges. Like other multipart types, the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} uses a
`boundary` to separate the pieces. Each piece has a
{{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} header with its actual type and a
{{HTTPHeader("Content-Range")}} of the range it represents.

```
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Type: multipart/byteranges; boundary=3d6b6a416f9b5
Content-Length: 385

--3d6b6a416f9b5
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Range: bytes 100-200/1270

eta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
    <meta name="vieport" content
--3d6b6a416f9b5
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Range: bytes 300-400/1270

-color: #f0f0f2;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        font-family: "Open Sans", "Helvetica
--3d6b6a416f9b5--
```

## Importance of setting the correct MIME type

Most web servers send unrecognized resources as the
`application/octet-stream` MIME type. For security reasons, most browsers do
not allow setting a custom default action for such resources, forcing the user to save
it to disk to use it.

Some common incorrect server configurations:

- RAR-compressed files. In this case, the ideal would be the true type of the
  original files; this is often impossible as .RAR files can hold several resources of
  different types. In this case, configure the server to send
  `application/x-rar-compressed`.
- Audio and video. Only resources with the correct MIME Type will be played in
  {{HTMLElement("video")}} or {{HTMLElement("audio")}} elements. Be sure to specify
  the correct [media type for audio and
  video](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats).
- Proprietary file types. Avoid using `application/octet-stream` as most
  browsers do not allow defining a default behavior (like "Open in Word") for this
  generic MIME type. A specific type like `application/vnd.mspowerpoint`
  lets users open such files automatically in the presentation software of their
  choice.

## MIME sniffing

In the absence of a MIME type, or in certain cases where browsers believe they are
incorrect, browsers may perform _MIME sniffing_ — guessing the correct MIME type
by looking at the bytes of the resource.

Each browser performs MIME sniffing differently and under different circumstances. (For
example, Safari will look at the file extension in the URL if the sent MIME type is
unsuitable.) There are security concerns as some MIME types represent executable
content. Servers can prevent MIME sniffing by sending the
{{HTTPHeader("X-Content-Type-Options")}} header.

## Other methods of conveying document type

MIME types are not the only way to convey document type information:

- Filename suffixes are sometimes used, especially on Microsoft Windows. Not all
  operating systems consider these suffixes meaningful (such as Linux and MacOS), and
  there is no guarantee they are correct.
- Magic numbers. The syntax of different formats allows file-type inference by looking
  at their byte structure. For example, GIF files start with the
  `47 49 46 38 39` hexadecimal value (`GIF89`), and PNG files with
  `89 50 4E 47` (`.PNG`). Not all file types have magic numbers,
  so this is not 100% reliable either.
