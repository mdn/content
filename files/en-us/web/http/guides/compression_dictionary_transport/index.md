**Compression Dictionary Transport** is a way of using a shared compression dictionary to dramatically reduce the transport size of HTTP responses.

Compression algorithms are used in HTTP to reduce the size of resources downloaded over the network, reducing bandwidth cost and the time taken to load pages. Lossless HTTP compression algorithms work by finding redundancy in the source: for example, places where text like function is repeated. They then include just one copy of the redundant string, and replace occurrences of it in the resource with references to that copy. Since the references are shorter than the string, the compressed version is shorter.

For example, take this JavaScript:

```javascript
function a() {
  console.log("Hello World!");
}

function b() {
  console.log("I am here");
}
```

This could be compressed by replacing repeated strings with references to a previous location and number of characters, like in this example:

```Compressed
function a() {
  console.log("Hello World!");
}

[0:9]b[10:20]I am here[42:]
```

Where `[0:9]` refers to copying the 9 characters starting at character 0. Note this is a simple example to demonstrate the concept and the actual algorithms are more complex than this.

Clients can then easily reverse the compression after download to recreate the original, uncompressed resource.

Algorithms like {{glossary("Brotli compression")}} and {{glossary("Zstandard compression")}} achieve even greater efficiency by allowing the use of dictionaries of commonly encountered strings, so you don't need any copies of them in the compressed resource. These algorithms ship with a pre-defined, default dictionary that is used when compressing HTTP responses.

Compression Dictionary Transport builds on this by enabling you to provide your own dictionary which is especially applicable to a particular set of resources. The compression algorithm can then use as a source of strings when compressing and decompressing the resource.

Assuming the references from the previous example are included in that common dictionary, this could be further reduced to this:

```Compressed
[d1]a[d2]Hello World![d3]
[d1]b[d2]I am here[d3]
```

The dictionary can either be a separate resource that is only required for Compression Dictionary Transport. Or it can be an existing resource that is needed by the website.

For example, suppose your website uses a JavaScript library. You would typically load a specific version of the library, and might include the version name in the name of the library, like `<script src="my-library.v1.js">`. When the browser loads your page, it will fetch a copy of the library as a subresource.

If you then update to v2 of the library, most of the library's code will probably have stayed the same. So sites can greatly reduce the size of the download for `my-library.v2.js` by telling the browser to use `my-library.v1.js` as a compression dictionary for `my-library.v2.js`. Then all strings that are common between v1 and v2 don't need to be included in the download for v2, because the browser already has them. Most of the download size of `my-library.v2.js` is then just the delta between the two versions.

While text compression is incredibly effiction, creating files that are are often 25% the size of uncompressed files, delta compression allows for an order of magnitude more compression with [examples files of only 2% site](https://github.com/WICG/compression-dictionary-transport/blob/main/examples.md).

## Dictionary format

A compression dictionary is a "raw" file that does not follow any specific format, nor have a specific {{Glossary("MIME type")}}. They are regular files that can be used to compress other files with similar content and so can be text files or even binary. For example, [WASM](/docs/WebAssembly) binary files are large resources that can also benefit from delta compression.

## Existing resource as a dictionary

To use a resource as a dictionary the resource will include the {{HTTPHeader("Use-As-Dictionary")}} HTTP response Header:

```http
Use-As-Dictionary: match="/js/app.*.js"
```

When a subsequent resource is requested (for example, `app.v2.js`) that matches the specified pattern, the request will include a SHA-256 hash of the available disctionary in the {{HTTPHeader("Available-Dictionary")}} HTTP Header, along with `dcb` and/or `dcz` values in the {{HTTPHeader("Accept-Encoding")}} HTTP Header (for delta compression brotli or zstd as appropriate):

```http
Accept-Encoding: gzip, br, zstd, dcb, dcz
Available-Dictionary: :pZGm1Av0IEBKARczz7exkNYsZb8LzaMrV7J32a2fFG4=:
```

The server can then respond with an appropriately-encoded response and content encoding in the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Encoding")}} HTTP Header:

```http
Content-Encoding: dcb
```

If the response is cacheable, it MUST include a {{HTTPHeader("Vary")}} to prevent caches serving dictionary-compressed resources to clients that don't support them or serving the response compressed with the wrong dictionary:

```http
Vary: accept-encoding, available-dictionary
```

An optional `id` can also be provided in the {{HTTPHeader("Use-As-Dictionary")}} header:

```http
Use-As-Dictionary: match="/js/app.*.js", id="dictionary-12345"
```

In which case the value will be sent in future requests in the {{HTTPHeader("Dictionary-ID")}} header:

```http
Accept-Encoding: gzip, br, zstd, dcb, dcz
Available-Dictionary: :pZGm1Av0IEBKARczz7exkNYsZb8LzaMrV7J32a2fFG4=:
Dictionary-ID: "dictionary-12345"
```

## Separate dictionary

Alternatively, an HTML document can specify one or more separate dictionaries with {{HTMLElement("Link#compression-dictionary", "&lt;link rel=&quot;compression-dictionary&quot;&gt;")}} elements:

```html
<link rel="compression-dictionary" href="/dictionary.dat" />
```

This dictionary is then downloaded by the browser during idle time, and that response must include the {{HTTPHeader("Use-As-Dictionary")}} HTTP Header:

```http
Use-As-Dictionary: match="/js/app.*.js"
```

From here the process is similar to the previous example when a matching resources is requested.

## Creating dictionary compressed responses

Delta-compressed dictioresourcesnaries use the Brotli or ZStandard algothms, a custom dictionary, but also include a magic header and embedded dictionary hash.

These can be created dynamically, but it is often better to create these in advance at build time. This will require deciding how many delta-compressed versions to create â€” for the last version only, or for the last X versions.

Example command line options are shown below, and these can be configured in build tools if they do not natively support this.

### Delta-compressed Brotli (`dcb`) a resource

Assuming the dictionary file is `dictionary.txt` and the file to be compressed is data.text, this will create a `dcb`-compressed file `data.txt.dcb` that includes the magic header and embedded dictionary hash:

```bash
echo -en '\xffDCB' > data.txt.dcb && \
openssl dgst -sha256 -binary dictionary.txt >> data.txt.dcb && \
brotli --stdout -D dictionary.txt data.txt >> data.txt.dcb
```

### Delta-compressed Brotli (`dcz`) a resource

Assuming the dictionary file is `dictionary.txt` and the file to be compressed is data.text, this will create a `dcb`-compressed file `data.txt.dcb` that includes the magic header and embedded dictionary hash:

```bash
echo -en '\x5e\x2a\x4d\x18\x20\x00\x00\x00' > data.txt.dcz && \
openssl dgst -sha256 -binary dictionary.txt >> data.txt.dcz && \
zstd -D dictionary.txt -f -o tmp.zstd data.txt && \
cat tmp.zstd >> data.txt.dcz
```

## Restrictions

Compression algorithms are at risk of security attacks, so there are a number of restrictions for Compression Dictionary Transport, including:

- Dictionaries must be served on the same-origin as the resource using the dictionary.
- Delta-compressed resources must be same-origin to the document origin, or follow the [CORS](/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) rules, and so be requested with the [`crossorigin`](/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/crossorigin) attribute and served with an appropriate {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin")}} header.

Additionally, Compression Dictionary Transport could themselves becoming tracking vectors so browsers may restrict this feature when cookies are disabled or when other extra privacy protections are enabled.
