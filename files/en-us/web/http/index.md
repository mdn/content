**_Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)_** is an [application-layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_Layer) protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical [client-server model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model), with a client opening a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a [stateless protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stateless_protocol), meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.

## Tutorials

Learn how to use HTTP with guides and tutorials.

- [Overview of HTTP](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview)
  - : The basic features of the client-server protocol: what it can do and its intended uses.
- [HTTP Cache](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching)
  - : Caching is very important for fast Web sites. This article describes different methods of caching and how to use HTTP Headers to control them.
- [HTTP Cookies](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)
  - : How cookies work is defined by [RFC 6265](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6265). When serving an HTTP request, a server can send a `Set-Cookie` HTTP header with the response. The client then returns the cookie's value with every request to the same server in the form of a `Cookie` request header. The cookie can also be set to expire on a certain date, or restricted to a specific domain and path.
- [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
  - : **Cross-site HTTP requests** are HTTP requests for resources from a **different domain** than the domain of the resource making the request. For instance, an HTML page from Domain A (`http://domaina.example/`) makes a request for an image on Domain B (`http://domainb.foo/image.jpg`) via the `img` element. Web pages today very commonly load cross-site resources, including CSS stylesheets, images, scripts, and other resources. CORS allows web developers to control how their site reacts to cross-site requests.
- [HTTP Client Hints](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client_hints)
  - : **Client Hints** are a set of response headers that a server can use to proactively request information from a client about the device, network, user, and user-agent-specific preferences.
    The server can then determine which resources to send, based on the information that the client chooses to provide.

- [HTTP Headers](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)
  - : HTTP message headers are used to describe a resource, or the behavior of the server or the client. Header fields are kept in an [IANA registry](https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml#perm-headers). IANA also maintains a [registry of proposed new HTTP message headers](https://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml#prov-headers).
- [HTTP Request Methods](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
  - : The different operations that can be done with HTTP: {{HTTPMethod("GET")}}, {{HTTPMethod("POST")}}, and also less common requests like {{HTTPMethod("OPTIONS")}}, {{HTTPMethod("DELETE")}}, or {{HTTPMethod("TRACE")}}.
- [HTTP Status Response Codes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)
  - : HTTP response codes indicate whether a specific HTTP request has been successfully completed. Responses are grouped in five classes: informational responses, successful responses, redirections, client errors, and servers errors.
- [CSP directives](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy)
  - : The {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}} response header fields allows website administrators to control resources the user agent is allowed to load for a given page. With a few exceptions, policies mostly involve specifying server origins and script endpoints.
