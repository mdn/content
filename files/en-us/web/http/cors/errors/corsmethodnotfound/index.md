## Reason

```
Reason: Did not find method in CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods'
```

## What went wrong?

The HTTP method being used by the {{Glossary("CORS")}} request is not included in the
list of methods specified by the response's
{{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods")}} header. This header specifies a
comma-delineated list of the HTTP methods which may be used when using CORS to access
the URL specified in the request; if the request is using any other method, this error
occurs.

For example, if the response includes:

    Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET,HEAD,POST

Trying to use a {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}} request will fail with this error.

Make sure your code only uses the permitted HTTP methods when accessing the service.

**Note:** If the server includes any unrecognized or undefined method
names in its `Access-Control-Allow-methods` header, a different error occurs:
[`Reason: invalid token ‘xyz' in CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Methods’`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors/CORSInvalidAllowMethod).
