## Reason

```
Reason: CORS header 'Origin' cannot be added
```

## What went wrong?

The {{Glossary("user agent")}} was unable to add the required {{HTTPHeader("Origin")}}
header to the {{Glossary("HTTP")}} request. All CORS requests must have an
`Origin` header.

This can happen if the JavaScript code is running with enhanced privileges allowing it
access to multiple domains' content, for example.
