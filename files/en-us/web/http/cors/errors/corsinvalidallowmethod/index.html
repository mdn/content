<pre
  class="brush: html">Reason: invalid token ‘xyz’ in CORS header ‘Access-Control-Allow-Methods’</pre>

<h2 id="What_went_wrong">What went wrong?</h2>

<p>The response to the {{Glossary("CORS")}} request that was sent by the server includes
  an {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods")}} header which includes at least one
  invalid method name.</p>

<p>The <code>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</code> header is sent by the server to let the
  client know what <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods">HTTP request methods</a> it
  supports for CORS requests. The header's value is a comma-delineated string of HTTP
  method names, such as {{HTTPMethod("GET")}}, {{HTTPMethod("POST")}}, or
  {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}}. If any of the specified values are not recognized by the client
  {{Glossary("user agent")}}, this error occurs.</p>

<p>This is a problem that most likely can only be fixed on the server side, by modifying
  the server's configuration to no longer send the invalid or unknown method name with the
  <code>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</code> header. It may also be worth checking to
  ensure that the user agent or HTTP library you're using on the client is up-to-date.</p>
