<h2 id="What_went_wrong">What went wrong?</h2>

<p>The {{Glossary("CORS")}} request was responded to by the server with an HTTP redirect
  to a URL on a different origin than the original request, which is not permitted during
  CORS requests.</p>

<p>For example, if the page <code>https://service.tld/fetchdata</code> were requested, and
  the HTTP response is "301 Moved Permanently", "307 Temporary Redirect", or "308
  Permanent Redirect" with a <code>Location</code> of
  <code>https://anotherservice.net/getdata</code>, the CORS request will fail in this
  manner.</p>

<p>To fix the problem, update your code to use the new URL as reported by the redirect,
  thereby avoiding the redirect.</p>
