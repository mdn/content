## Reason

```plain
Reason: Multiple CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' not allowed
```

## What went wrong?

More than one {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin")}} header was sent by the
server. This isn't allowed.

If you have access to the server you can change your implementation to echo back an
origin in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header. You cannot send back a
list of origins, because browsers only accept a value that is either a single origin or
null
