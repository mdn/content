<h2 id="What_went_wrong">What went wrong?</h2>

<p>The {{Glossary("CORS")}} request requiresÂ  preflight, preflighting could not be
  performed. There are a couple of reasons why preflighting might fail:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A cross-site request has previously been performed that already did a preflight, and
    doing the preflight again is not permitted. Make sure your code only preflights once
    per connection.</li>
  <li>The preflight request suffered any kind of networking error that might ordinarily
    occur.</li>
</ul>
