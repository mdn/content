## Reason

```plain
Reason: missing token 'xyz' in CORS header 'Access-Control-Allow-Headers' from CORS preflight channel
```

## What went wrong?

The `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header is sent by the server to let the client know which headers it supports for {{Glossary("CORS")}} requests. The value of `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` should be a comma-delineated list of header names, such as "`X-Custom-Information`" or any of the standard but non-basic header names (which are always allowed).

This error occurs when attempting to preflight a header that is not expressly allowed (that is, it's not included in the list specified by the `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` header sent by the server). To fix this, the server needs to be updated so that it allows the indicated header, or you need to avoid using that header.
