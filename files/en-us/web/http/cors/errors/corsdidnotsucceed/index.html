<pre class="brush: html">Reason: CORS request did not succeed</pre>

<h2 id="What_went_wrong">What went wrong?</h2>

<p>The {{Glossary("HTTP")}} request which makes use of CORS failed because the HTTP
  connection failed at either the network or protocol level. The error is not directly
  related to CORS, but is a fundamental network error of some kind.</p>

<p>In many cases, it is caused by a browser plugin (e.g. an ad blocker or privacy
  protector) blocking the request.</p>

<p>Other possible causes include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Trying to access an <code>https</code> resource that has an invalid certificate will
    cause this error.</li>
  <li>Trying to access an <code>http</code> resource from a page with an
    <code>https</code> origin will also cause this error.</li>
  <li>As of Firefox 68, <code>https</code> pages are not permitted to access
    <code>http://localhost</code>, although this may be changed by <a
      href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1488740">Bug 1488740</a>.</li>
  <li>The server did not respond to the actual request (even if it responded to the
    {{Glossary("Preflight request")}}). One scenario might be an HTTP service being
    developed that panicked without returning any data.</li>
</ul>
