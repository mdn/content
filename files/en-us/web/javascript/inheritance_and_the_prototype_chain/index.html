<p>JavaScript is a bit confusing for developers experienced in class-based languages (like Java or C++), as it is dynamic and does not provide a <code>class</code> implementation per se (the <code>class</code> keyword is introduced in ES2015, but is syntactical sugar, JavaScript remains prototype-based).</p>

<p>When it comes to inheritance, JavaScript only has one construct: objects. Each object has a private property which holds a link to another object called its <strong>prototype</strong>. That prototype object has a prototype of its own, and so on until an object is reached with <code>null</code> as its prototype. By definition, <code>null</code> has no prototype, and acts as the final link in this <strong>prototype chain</strong>.</p>

<p>Nearly all objects in JavaScript are instances of {{jsxref("Object")}} which sits on the top of a prototype chain.</p>

<p>While this confusion is often considered to be one of JavaScript's weaknesses, the prototypal inheritance model itself is, in fact, more powerful than the classic model. It is, for example, fairly trivial to build a classic model on top of a prototypal model.</p>

<h2 id="Inheritance_with_the_prototype_chain">Inheritance with the prototype chain</h2>

<h3 id="Inheriting_properties">Inheriting properties</h3>

<p>JavaScript objects are dynamic "bags" of properties (referred to as <strong>own properties</strong>). JavaScript objects have a link to a prototype object. When trying to access a property of an object, the property will not only be sought on the object but on the prototype of the object, the prototype of the prototype, and so on until either a property with a matching name is found or the end of the prototype chain is reached.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Following the ECMAScript standard, the notation <code>someObject.[[Prototype]]</code> is used to designate the prototype of <code>someObject</code>. Since ECMAScript 2015, the <code>[[Prototype]]</code> is accessed using the accessors {{jsxref("Object.getPrototypeOf()")}} and {{jsxref("Object.setPrototypeOf()")}}. This is equivalent to the JavaScript property <code>__proto__</code> which is non-standard but de-facto implemented by many browsers.</p>

<p>It should not be confused with the <code><em>func</em>.prototype</code> property of functions, which instead specifies the <code>[[Prototype]]</code> to be assigned to all <em>instances</em> of objects created by the given function when used as a constructor. The <code><strong>Object.prototype</strong></code> property represents the {{jsxref("Object")}} prototype object.</p>
</div>

<p>Here is what happens when trying to access a property:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">// Let's create an object o from function f with its own properties a and b:
let f = function () {
   this.a = 1;
   this.b = 2;
}
let o = new f(); // {a: 1, b: 2}

// add properties in f function's prototype
f.prototype.b = 3;
f.prototype.c = 4;

// do not set the prototype f.prototype = {b:3,c:4}; this will break the prototype chain
// o.[[Prototype]] has properties b and c.
// o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is Object.prototype.
// Finally, o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is null.
// This is the end of the prototype chain, as null,
// by definition, has no [[Prototype]].
// Thus, the full prototype chain looks like:
// {a: 1, b: 2} ---&gt; {b: 3, c: 4} ---&gt; Object.prototype ---&gt; null

console.log(o.a); // 1
// Is there an 'a' own property on o? Yes, and its value is 1.

console.log(o.b); // 2
// Is there a 'b' own property on o? Yes, and its value is 2.
// The prototype also has a 'b' property, but it's not visited.
// This is called Property Shadowing

console.log(o.c); // 4
// Is there a 'c' own property on o? No, check its prototype.
// Is there a 'c' own property on o.[[Prototype]]? Yes, its value is 4.

console.log(o.d); // undefined
// Is there a 'd' own property on o? No, check its prototype.
// Is there a 'd' own property on o.[[Prototype]]? No, check its prototype.
// o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is Object.prototype and there is no 'd' property by default, check its prototype.
// o.[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]].[[Prototype]] is null, stop searching,
// no property found, return undefined.
</pre>

<p>Setting a property to an object creates an own property. The only exception to the getting and setting behavior rules is when there is an inherited property with a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#defining_getters_and_setters">getter or a setter</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Inheriting_methods">Inheriting "methods"</h3>

<p>JavaScript does not have "methods" in the form that class-based languages define them. In JavaScript, any function can be added to an object in the form of a property. An inherited function acts just as any other property, including property shadowing as shown above (in this case, a form of <em>method overriding</em>).</p>

<p>When an inherited function is executed, the value of <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this"><code>this</code></a> points to the inheriting object, not to the prototype object where the function is an own property.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var o = {
  a: 2,
  m: function() {
    return this.a + 1;
  }
};

console.log(o.m()); // 3
// When calling o.m in this case, 'this' refers to o

var p = Object.create(o);
// p is an object that inherits from o

p.a = 4; // creates a property 'a' on p
console.log(p.m()); // 5
// when p.m is called, 'this' refers to p.
// So when p inherits the function m of o,
// 'this.a' means p.a, the property 'a' of p

</pre>

<h2 id="Using_prototypes_in_JavaScript">Using prototypes in JavaScript</h2>

<p>Let's look at what happens behind the scenes in a bit more detail.</p>

<p>In JavaScript, as mentioned above, functions are able to have properties. All functions have a special property named <code>prototype</code>. Please note that the code below is free-standing (it is safe to assume there is no other JavaScript on the webpage other than the below code). For the best learning experience, it is highly recommended that you open a console, navigate to the "console" tab, copy-and-paste in the below JavaScript code, and run it by pressing the Enter/Return key. (The console is included in most web browser's Developer Tools. More information is available for <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools">Firefox Developer Tools</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/">Chrome DevTools</a>, and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/devtools-guide">Edge DevTools</a>.)</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function doSomething(){}
console.log( doSomething.prototype );
//  It does not matter how you declare the function; a
//  function in JavaScript will always have a default
//  prototype property — with one exception: an arrow
//  function doesn't have a default prototype property:
const doSomethingFromArrowFunction = () =&gt; {};
console.log( doSomethingFromArrowFunction.prototype );
</pre>

<p>As seen above, <code>doSomething()</code> has a default <code>prototype</code> property, as demonstrated by the console. After running this code, the console should have displayed an object that looks similar to this.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">{
    constructor: ƒ doSomething(),
    __proto__: {
        constructor: ƒ Object(),
        hasOwnProperty: ƒ hasOwnProperty(),
        isPrototypeOf: ƒ isPrototypeOf(),
        propertyIsEnumerable: ƒ propertyIsEnumerable(),
        toLocaleString: ƒ toLocaleString(),
        toString: ƒ toString(),
        valueOf: ƒ valueOf()
    }
}</pre>

<p>We can add properties to the prototype of <code>doSomething()</code>, as shown below.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function doSomething(){}
doSomething.prototype.foo = "bar";
console.log( doSomething.prototype );</pre>

<p>This results in:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">{
    foo: "bar",
    constructor: ƒ doSomething(),
    __proto__: {
        constructor: ƒ Object(),
        hasOwnProperty: ƒ hasOwnProperty(),
        isPrototypeOf: ƒ isPrototypeOf(),
        propertyIsEnumerable: ƒ propertyIsEnumerable(),
        toLocaleString: ƒ toLocaleString(),
        toString: ƒ toString(),
        valueOf: ƒ valueOf()
    }
}
</pre>

<p>We can now use the <code>new</code> operator to create an instance of <code>doSomething()</code> based on this prototype. To use the new operator, call the function normally except prefix it with <code>new</code>. Calling a function with the <code>new</code> operator returns an object that is an instance of the function. Properties can then be added onto this object.</p>

<p>Try the following code:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function doSomething(){}
doSomething.prototype.foo = "bar"; // add a property onto the prototype
var doSomeInstancing = new doSomething();
doSomeInstancing.prop = "some value"; // add a property onto the object
console.log( doSomeInstancing );</pre>

<p>This results in an output similar to the following:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">{
    prop: "some value",
    __proto__: {
        foo: "bar",
        constructor: ƒ doSomething(),
        __proto__: {
            constructor: ƒ Object(),
            hasOwnProperty: ƒ hasOwnProperty(),
            isPrototypeOf: ƒ isPrototypeOf(),
            propertyIsEnumerable: ƒ propertyIsEnumerable(),
            toLocaleString: ƒ toLocaleString(),
            toString: ƒ toString(),
            valueOf: ƒ valueOf()
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p>As seen above, the <code>__proto__</code> of <code>doSomeInstancing</code> is <code>doSomething.prototype</code>. But, what does this do? When you access a property of <code>doSomeInstancing</code>, the browser first looks to see if <code>doSomeInstancing</code> has that property.</p>

<p>If <code>doSomeInstancing</code> does not have the property, then the browser looks for the property in the <code>__proto__</code> of <code>doSomeInstancing</code> (a.k.a. doSomething.prototype). If the <code>__proto__</code> of doSomeInstancing has the property being looked for, then that property on the <code>__proto__</code> of doSomeInstancing is used.</p>

<p>Otherwise, if the <code>__proto__</code> of doSomeInstancing does not have the property, then the <code>__proto__</code> of the <code>__proto__</code> of doSomeInstancing is checked for the property. By default, the <code>__proto__</code> of any function's prototype property is <code>window.Object.prototype</code>. So, the <code>__proto__</code> of the <code>__proto__</code> of doSomeInstancing (a.k.a. the <code>__proto__</code> of doSomething.prototype (a.k.a. <code>Object.prototype</code>)) is then looked through for the property being searched for.</p>

<p>If the property is not found in the <code>__proto__</code> of the <code>__proto__</code> of doSomeInstancing, then the <code>__proto__</code> of the <code>__proto__</code> of the <code>__proto__</code> of doSomeInstancing is looked through. However, there is a problem: the <code>__proto__</code> of the <code>__proto__</code> of the <code>__proto__</code> of doSomeInstancing does not exist. Then, and only then, after the entire prototype chain of <code>__proto__</code>'s is looked through, and there are no more <code>__proto__</code>s does the browser assert that the property does not exist and conclude that the value at the property is <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<p>Let's try entering some more code into the console:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function doSomething(){}
doSomething.prototype.foo = "bar";
var doSomeInstancing = new doSomething();
doSomeInstancing.prop = "some value";
console.log("doSomeInstancing.prop:      " + doSomeInstancing.prop);
console.log("doSomeInstancing.foo:       " + doSomeInstancing.foo);
console.log("doSomething.prop:           " + doSomething.prop);
console.log("doSomething.foo:            " + doSomething.foo);
console.log("doSomething.prototype.prop: " + doSomething.prototype.prop);
console.log("doSomething.prototype.foo:  " + doSomething.prototype.foo);</pre>

<p>This results in the following:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">doSomeInstancing.prop:      some value
doSomeInstancing.foo:       bar
doSomething.prop:           undefined
doSomething.foo:            undefined
doSomething.prototype.prop: undefined
doSomething.prototype.foo:  bar</pre>

<h2 id="Different_ways_to_create_objects_and_the_resulting_prototype_chain">Different ways to create objects and the resulting prototype chain</h2>

<h3 id="Objects_created_with_syntax_constructs">Objects created with syntax constructs</h3>

<pre class="brush: js">var o = {a: 1};

// The newly created object o has Object.prototype as its [[Prototype]]
// o has no own property named 'hasOwnProperty'
// hasOwnProperty is an own property of Object.prototype.
// So o inherits hasOwnProperty from Object.prototype
// Object.prototype has null as its prototype.
// o ---&gt; Object.prototype ---&gt; null

var b = ['yo', 'whadup', '?'];

// Arrays inherit from Array.prototype
// (which has methods indexOf, forEach, etc.)
// The prototype chain looks like:
// b ---&gt; Array.prototype ---&gt; Object.prototype ---&gt; null

function f() {
  return 2;
}

// Functions inherit from Function.prototype
// (which has methods call, bind, etc.)
// f ---&gt; Function.prototype ---&gt; Object.prototype ---&gt; null
</pre>

<h3 id="With_a_constructor">With a constructor</h3>

<p>A constructor in JavaScript is just a function that happens to be called with the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new">new operator</a>.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function Graph() {
  this.vertices = [];
  this.edges = [];
}

Graph.prototype.addVertex = function(v) {
  this.vertices.push(v);
}

var g = new Graph();
// g is an object with own properties 'vertices' and 'edges'.
// g.[[Prototype]] is the value of Graph.prototype when new Graph() is executed.
</pre>

<h3 id="With_Object.create">With <code>Object.create</code></h3>

<p>ECMAScript 5 introduced a new method: {{jsxref("Object.create()")}}. Calling this method creates a new object. The prototype of this object is the first argument of the function:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var a = {a: 1};
// a ---&gt; Object.prototype ---&gt; null

var b = Object.create(a);
// b ---&gt; a ---&gt; Object.prototype ---&gt; null
console.log(b.a); // 1 (inherited)

var c = Object.create(b);
// c ---&gt; b ---&gt; a ---&gt; Object.prototype ---&gt; null

var d = Object.create(null);
// d ---&gt; null
console.log(d.hasOwnProperty);
// undefined, because d doesn't inherit from Object.prototype
</pre>

<h3 id="delete_Operator_with_Object.create_and_new_operator"><code>delete</code> Operator with <code>Object.create</code> and <code>new</code> operator</h3>

<p>Using <code>Object.create</code> of another object demonstrates prototypical inheritance with the <code>delete</code> operation:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var a = {a: 1};

var b = Object.create(a);

console.log(a.a); // print 1
console.log(b.a); // print 1
b.a=5;
console.log(a.a); // print 1
console.log(b.a); // print 5
delete b.a;
console.log(a.a); // print 1
console.log(b.a); // print 1 (b.a value 5 is deleted but it showing value from its prototype chain)
delete a.a;       // This can also be done via 'delete Object.getPrototypeOf(b).a'
console.log(a.a); // print undefined
console.log(b.a); // print undefined</pre>

<p>In the following example, calling <code>new Graph()</code> creates a <code>Graph</code> instance that has its own <code>vertices</code> property, and that doesn’t inherit any <code>vertices</code> property. So when the <code>vertices</code> property is deleted from that <code>Graph</code> instance, the instance then has neither its own <code>vertices</code> property nor any inherited <code>vertices</code> property.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function Graph() {
  this.vertices = [4,4];
}

var g = new Graph();
console.log(g.vertices); // print [4,4]
console.log(g.__proto__.vertices) // print undefined
g.vertices = 25;
console.log(g.vertices); // print 25
delete g.vertices;
console.log(g.vertices); // print undefined
</pre>

<h3 id="With_the_class_keyword">With the <code>class</code> keyword</h3>

<p>ECMAScript 2015 introduced a new set of keywords implementing <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes">classes</a>. The new keywords include {{jsxref("Statements/class", "class")}}, {{jsxref("Classes/constructor", "constructor")}}, {{jsxref("Classes/static", "static")}}, {{jsxref("Classes/extends", "extends")}}, and {{jsxref("Operators/super", "super")}}.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">'use strict';

class Polygon {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
}

class Square extends Polygon {
  constructor(sideLength) {
    super(sideLength, sideLength);
  }
  get area() {
    return this.height * this.width;
  }
  set sideLength(newLength) {
    this.height = newLength;
    this.width = newLength;
  }
}

var square = new Square(2);
</pre>

<h3 id="Performance">Performance</h3>

<p>The lookup time for properties that are high up on the prototype chain can have a negative impact on the performance, and this may be significant in the code where performance is critical. Additionally, trying to access nonexistent properties will always traverse the full prototype chain.</p>

<p>Also, when iterating over the properties of an object, <strong>every</strong> enumerable property that is on the prototype chain will be enumerated. To check whether an object has a property defined on <em>itself</em> and not somewhere on its prototype chain, it is necessary to use the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty"><code>hasOwnProperty</code></a> method which all objects inherit from <code>Object.prototype</code>. To give you a concrete example, let's take the above graph example code to illustrate it:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">console.log(g.hasOwnProperty('vertices'));
// true

console.log(g.hasOwnProperty('nope'));
// false

console.log(g.hasOwnProperty('addVertex'));
// false

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(g).hasOwnProperty('addVertex'));
// true
</pre>

<p><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/hasOwnProperty"><code>hasOwnProperty</code></a> is the only thing in JavaScript which deals with properties and does <strong>not</strong> traverse the prototype chain.</p>

<p>Note: It is <strong>not</strong> enough to check whether a property is <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined"><code>undefined</code></a>. The property might very well exist, but its value just happens to be set to <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<h3 id="Summary_of_methods_for_extending_the_prototype_chain">Summary of methods for extending the prototype chain</h3>

<p>Here are all 4 ways and their pros/cons. All of the examples listed below create exactly the same resulting <code>inst</code> object (thus logging the same results to the console), except in different ways.</p>

<h2 id="prototype_and_Object.getPrototypeOf"><code>prototype</code> and <code>Object.getPrototypeOf</code></h2>

<p>JavaScript is a bit confusing for developers coming from Java or C++, as it's all dynamic, all runtime, and it has no classes at all. It's all just instances (objects). Even the "classes" we simulate are just a function object.</p>

<p>You probably already noticed that our <a href="#4_setting_the___proto___property">function A</a> has a special property called <code>prototype</code>. This special property works with the JavaScript <code>new </code>operator. The reference to the prototype object is copied to the internal <code>[[Prototype]]</code> property of the new instance. For example, when you do <code>var a1 = new A()</code>, JavaScript (after creating the object in memory and before running function <code>A()</code> with <code>this</code> defined to it) sets <code>a1.[[Prototype]] = A.prototype</code>. When you then access properties of the instance, JavaScript first checks whether they exist on that object directly, and if not, it looks in <code>[[Prototype]]</code>. This means that all the stuff you define in <code>prototype</code> is effectively shared by all instances, and you can even later change parts of <code>prototype</code> and have the changes appear in all existing instances, if you wanted to.</p>

<p>If, in the example above, you do <code>var a1 = new A(); var a2 = new A();</code> then <code>a1.doSomething</code> would actually refer to <code>Object.getPrototypeOf(a1).doSomething</code>, which is the same as the <code>A.prototype.doSomething</code> you defined, i.e. <code>Object.getPrototypeOf(a1).doSomething == Object.getPrototypeOf(a2).doSomething == A.prototype.doSomething</code>.</p>

<p>In short, <code>prototype</code> is for types, while <code>Object.getPrototypeOf()</code> is the same for instances.</p>

<p><code>[[Prototype]]</code> is looked at <em>recursively</em>, i.e. <code>a1.doSomething</code>, <code>Object.getPrototypeOf(a1).doSomething</code>, <code>Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf(a1)).doSomething</code> etc., until it's found or <code>Object.getPrototypeOf </code>returns null.</p>

<p>So, when you call</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var o = new Foo();</pre>

<p>JavaScript actually just does</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var o = new Object();
o.[[Prototype]] = Foo.prototype;
Foo.call(o);</pre>

<p>(or something like that) and when you later do</p>

<pre class="brush: js">o.someProp;</pre>

<p>it checks whether <code>o</code> has a property <code>someProp</code>. If not, it checks <code>Object.getPrototypeOf(o).someProp</code>, and if that doesn't exist it checks <code>Object.getPrototypeOf(Object.getPrototypeOf(o)).someProp</code>, and so on.</p>

<h2 id="In_conclusion">In conclusion</h2>

<p>It is essential to understand the prototypal inheritance model before writing complex code that makes use of it. Also, be aware of the length of the prototype chains in your code and break them up if necessary to avoid possible performance problems. Further, the native prototypes should <strong>never</strong> be extended unless it is for the sake of compatibility with newer JavaScript features.</p>
