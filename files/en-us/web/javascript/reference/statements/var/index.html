<p>The <strong><code>var</code> statement</strong> declares a function-scoped or
  globally-scoped variable, optionally initializing it to a value.</p>

<div>{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/statement-var.html")}}</div>


<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre
  class="brush: js">var <var>varname1</var> [= <var>value1</var>] [, <var>varname2</var> [= <var>value2</var>] ... [, <var>varname<strong>N</strong></var> [= <var>value<strong>N</strong></var>]]];</pre>

<dl>
  <dt><code><var>varname<strong>N</strong></var></code></dt>
  <dd>Variable name. It can be any legal identifier.</dd>
  <dt><code><var>value<strong>N</strong></var></code> {{optional_inline}}</dt>
  <dd>Initial value of the variable. It can be any legal expression. Default value is
    <code>undefined</code>. </dd>
</dl>

<p>Alternatively, the <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment">Destructuring
    Assignment </a>syntax can also be used to declare variables.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var <var>{ bar }</var> = <em>foo</em>; // where foo = { bar:10, baz:12 };
/* This creates a variable with the name 'bar', which has a value of 10 */</pre>

<h2 id="Description">Description</h2>

<p><code>var</code> declarations, wherever they occur, are processed before any code is
  executed. This is called <dfn>hoisting</dfn>, and is discussed further below.</p>

<p>The scope of a variable declared with <code>var</code> is its current <em>execution
    context and closures thereof</em>, which is either the enclosing function and
  functions declared within it, or, for variables declared outside any function, global.
  Duplicate variable declarations using <code>var</code> will not trigger an error, even
  in strict mode, and the variable will not lose its value, unless another assignment is
  performed.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">'use strict';
function foo() {
  var x = 1;
  function bar() {
    var y = 2;
    console.log(x); // 1 (function `bar` closes over `x`)
    console.log(y); // 2 (`y` is in scope)
  }
  bar();
  console.log(x); // 1 (`x` is in scope)
  console.log(y); // ReferenceError in strict mode, `y` is scoped to `bar`
}

foo();
</pre>

<p>Variables declared using <code>var</code> are created before any code is executed in a
  process known as hoisting. Their initial value is <code>undefined</code>.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">'use strict';
console.log(x);                // undefined (note: not ReferenceError)
console.log('still going...'); // still going...
var x = 1;
console.log(x);                // 1
console.log('still going...'); // still going...</pre>

<p>In the global context, a variable declared using <code>var</code> is added as a
  non-configurable property of the global object. This means its property descriptor
  cannot be changed and it cannot be deleted using {{JSxRef("Operators/delete", "delete")}}. The corresponding
  name is also added to a list on the internal <code>[[VarNames]]</code> slot on the <a
    href="https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/index.html#sec-global-environment-records">global
    environment record</a> (which forms part of the global lexical environment). The list
  of names in <code>[[VarNames]]</code> enables the runtime to distinguish between global
  variables and straightforward properties on the global object.</p>

<p>The property created on the global object for global variables, is set to be
  non-configurable because the identifier is to be treated as a variable, rather than a
  straightforward property of the global object. JavaScript has automatic memory
  management, and it would make no sense to be able to use the <code>delete</code>
  operator on a global variable.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">'use strict';
var x = 1;
globalThis.hasOwnProperty('x'); // true
delete globalThis.x; // TypeError in strict mode. Fails silently otherwise.
delete x;  // SyntaxError in strict mode. Fails silently otherwise.
</pre>

<p>Note that in both NodeJS <a href="http://www.commonjs.org/">CommonJS</a> modules and
  native <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules">ECMAScript modules</a>,
  top-level variable declarations are scoped to the module, and are not, therefore added
  as properties to the global object.</p>

<h3 id="Unqualified_identifier_assignments">Unqualified identifier assignments</h3>

<p>The global object sits at the top of the scope chain. When attempting to resolve a name
  to a value, the scope chain is searched. This means that properties on the global object
  are conveniently visible from every scope, without having to qualify the names with
  <code>globalThis.</code> or <code>window.</code> or <code>global.</code>.</p>

<p>So you can just type:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function foo() {
  String('s') // Note the function `String` is implicitly visible
}</pre>

<p>...because</p>

<pre class="brush: js">globalThis.hasOwnProperty('String') // true</pre>

<p>So the global object will ultimately be searched for unqualified identifiers. You don't
  have to type <code>globalThis.String</code>, you can just type the unqualified
  <code>String</code>. The corollary, in non-strict mode, is that assignment to
  unqualified identifiers will, if there is no variable of the same name declared in the
  scope chain, assume you want to create a property with that name on the global object.
</p>

<pre class="brush: js">foo = 'f' // In non-strict mode, assumes you want to create a property named `foo` on the global object
globalThis.hasOwnProperty('foo') // true
</pre>

<p>In ECMAScript 5, this behavior was changed for <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode">strict
    mode</a>. Assignment to an unqualified identifier in strict mode will result in a
  <code>ReferenceError</code>, to avoid the accidental creation of properties on the
  global object.</p>

<p>Note that the implication of the above, is that, contrary to popular misinformation,
  JavaScript does not have implicit or undeclared variables, it merely has a syntax that
  looks like it does.</p>

<h3 id="var_hoisting">var hoisting</h3>

<p>Because variable declarations (and declarations in general) are processed before any
  code is executed, declaring a variable anywhere in the code is equivalent to declaring
  it at the top. This also means that a variable can appear to be used before it's
  declared. This behavior is called "<dfn>hoisting</dfn>", as it appears that the variable
  declaration is moved to the top of the function or global code.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">bla = 2;
var bla;

// ...is implicitly understood as:

var bla;
bla = 2;
</pre>

<p>For that reason, it is recommended to always declare variables at the top of their
  scope (the top of global code and the top of function code) so it's clear which
  variables are function scoped (local) and which are resolved on the scope chain.</p>

<p>It's important to point out that the hoisting will affect the variable declaration, but
  not its value's initialization. The value will be indeed assigned when the assignment
  statement is reached:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function do_something() {
  console.log(bar); // undefined
  var bar = 111;
  console.log(bar); // 111
}

// ...is implicitly understood as:

function do_something() {
  var bar;
  console.log(bar); // undefined
  bar = 111;
  console.log(bar); // 111
}
</pre>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<h3 id="Declaring_and_initializing_two_variables">Declaring and initializing two variables
</h3>

<pre class="brush: js">var a = 0, b = 0;
</pre>

<h3 id="Assigning_two_variables_with_single_string_value">Assigning two variables with
  single string value</h3>

<pre class="brush: js">var a = 'A';
var b = a;

// ...is equivalent to:

var a, b = a = 'A';
</pre>

<p>Be mindful of the order:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var x = y, y = 'A';
console.log(x + y); // undefinedA
</pre>

<p>Here, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are declared before any code is executed, but
  the assignments occur later. At the time "<code>x = y</code>" is evaluated,
  <code>y</code> exists so no <code>ReferenceError</code> is thrown and its value is
  <code>undefined</code>. So, <code>x</code> is assigned the undefined value. Then,
  <code>y</code> is assigned the value <code>'A'</code>. Consequently, after the first
  line, <code>x === undefined &amp;&amp; y === 'A'</code>, hence the result.</p>

<h3 id="Initialization_of_several_variables">Initialization of several variables</h3>

<pre class="brush: js">var x = 0;
function f() {
  var x = y = 1; // Declares x locally; declares y globally.
}
f();

console.log(x, y); // 0 1

// In non-strict mode:
// x is the global one as expected;
// y is leaked outside of the function, though!</pre>

<p>The same example as above but with a strict mode:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">'use strict';

var x = 0;
function f() {
  var x = y = 1; // Throws a ReferenceError in strict mode.
}
f();

console.log(x, y);</pre>

<h3 id="Implicit_globals_and_outer_function_scope">Implicit globals and outer function
  scope</h3>

<p>Variables that appear to be implicit globals may be references to variables in an outer
  function scope:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var x = 0; // Declares x within file scope, then assigns it a value of 0.

console.log(typeof z); // "undefined", since z doesn't exist yet

function a() {
  var y = 2; // Declares y within scope of function a, then assigns it a value of 2.

  console.log(x, y); // 0 2

  function b() {
    x = 3; // Assigns 3 to existing file scoped x.
    y = 4; // Assigns 4 to existing outer y.
    z = 5; // Creates a new global variable z, and assigns it a value of 5.
           // (Throws a ReferenceError in strict mode.)
  }

  b(); // Creates z as a global variable.
  console.log(x, y, z); // 3 4 5
}

a(); // Also calls b.
console.log(x, z);     // 3 5
console.log(typeof y); // "undefined", as y is local to function a</pre>
