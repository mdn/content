{{jsSidebar("Statements")}}

The **`let`** statement declares a block-scoped local variable,
optionally initializing it to a value.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/statement-let.html")}}

## Syntax

```js
let name1 [= value1] [, name2 [= value2]] [, ..., nameN [= valueN];
```

### Parameters

- `nameN`
  - : The names of the variable or variables to declare. Each must be a legal JavaScript
    identifier.
- `valueN` {{optional_inline}}
  - : For each variable declared, you may optionally specify its initial value to any
    legal JavaScript expression.

Alternatively, the [Destructuring
Assignment ](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)syntax can also be used to declare variables.

```js
let { bar } = foo; // where foo = { bar:10, baz:12 };
/* This creates a variable with the name 'bar', which has a value of 10 */
```

## Description

**`let`** allows you to declare variables that are limited to
the scope of a {{jsxref("statements/block", "block", "", 1)}} statement, or expression
on which it is used, unlike the {{jsxref("statements/var", "var")}} keyword, which
declares a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block
scope. The other difference between {{jsxref("statements/var", "var")}} and
`let` is that the latter is initialized to a value only when a [parser evaluates it (see below)](#temporal_dead_zone_tdz).

Just like {{jsxref("statements/const", "const", "Description")}} the `let`
does _not_ create properties of the {{domxref("window")}} object when declared
globally (in the top-most scope).

An explanation of why the name "**let**" was chosen can be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37916940/why-was-the-name-let-chosen-for-block-scoped-variable-declarations-in-javascri).

## Examples

### Scoping rules

Variables declared by **`let`** have their scope in the block
for which they are declared, as well as in any contained sub-blocks. In this way,
**`let`** works very much like
**`var`**. The main difference is that the scope of a
**`var`** variable is the entire enclosing function:

```js
function varTest() {
  var x = 1;
  {
    var x = 2;  // same variable!
    console.log(x);  // 2
  }
  console.log(x);  // 2
}

function letTest() {
  let x = 1;
  {
    let x = 2;  // different variable
    console.log(x);  // 2
  }
  console.log(x);  // 1
}
```

At the top level of programs and functions,
**`let`**, unlike **`var`**, does not
create a property on the global object. For example:

```js
var x = 'global';
let y = 'global';
console.log(this.x); // "global"
console.log(this.y); // undefined
```

### Emulating private members

In dealing with {{Glossary("Constructor", "constructors")}} it is possible to use the
**`let`** bindings to share one or more private members without
using [closures](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures):

```js
var Thing;

{
  let privateScope = new WeakMap();
  let counter = 0;

  Thing = function() {
    this.someProperty = 'foo';

    privateScope.set(this, {
      hidden: ++counter,
    });
  };

  Thing.prototype.showPublic = function() {
    return this.someProperty;
  };

  Thing.prototype.showPrivate = function() {
    return privateScope.get(this).hidden;
  };
}

console.log(typeof privateScope);
// "undefined"

var thing = new Thing();

console.log(thing);
// Thing {someProperty: "foo"}

thing.showPublic();
// "foo"

thing.showPrivate();
// 1
```

The same privacy pattern with closures over local variables can be created with
`var`, but those need a function scope (typically an {{Glossary("IIFE")}} in
the module pattern) instead of just a block scope like in the example above.

### Redeclarations

Redeclaring the same variable within the same function or block scope raises a
{{jsxref("SyntaxError")}}.

```js example-bad
if (x) {
  let foo;
  let foo; // SyntaxError thrown.
}
```

You may encounter errors in {{jsxref("Statements/switch", "switch")}} statements
because there is only one block.

```js example-bad
let x = 1;
switch(x) {
  case 0:
    let foo;
    break;

  case 1:
    let foo; // SyntaxError for redeclaration.
    break;
}
```

However, it's important to point out that a block nested inside a case clause will
create a new block scoped lexical environment, which will not produce the redeclaration
errors shown above.

```js
let x = 1;

switch(x) {
  case 0: {
    let foo;
    break;
  }
  case 1: {
    let foo;
    break;
  }
}
```

### Temporal dead zone (TDZ)

`let` variables cannot be read/written until they have been fully
initialized, which happens when they are declared (if no initial value is specified on
declaration, the variable is initialized with a value of
`undefined`). Accessing the variable before the initialization results in a
{{jsxref("ReferenceError")}}.

> **Note:** This differs from {{jsxref("Statements/var", "var", "var_hoisting")}} variables,
> which will return a value of `undefined` if they are accessed before they
> are declared.

The variable is said to be in a "temporal dead zone" (TDZ) from the start of the block
until the initialization has completed.

```js example-bad
{ // TDZ starts at beginning of scope
  console.log(bar); // undefined
  console.log(foo); // ReferenceError
  var bar = 1;
  let foo = 2; // End of TDZ (for foo)
}
```

The term "temporal" is used because the zone depends on the order of execution (time)
rather than the order in which the code is written (position). For example, the code
below works because, even though the function that uses the `let` variable
appears before the variable is declared, the function is _called_ outside the
TDZ.

```js
{
    // TDZ starts at beginning of scope
    const func = () => console.log(letVar); // OK

    // Within the TDZ letVar access throws `ReferenceError`

    let letVar = 3; // End of TDZ (for letVar)
    func(); // Called outside TDZ!
}
```

#### The TDZ and `typeof`

Using the `typeof` operator for a `let` variable in its TDZ will
throw a {{jsxref("ReferenceError")}}:

```js example-bad
// results in a 'ReferenceError'
console.log(typeof i);
let i = 10;
```

This differs from using `typeof` for undeclared variables, and variables
that hold a value of `undefined`:

```js
// prints out 'undefined'
console.log(typeof undeclaredVariable);
```

#### TDZ combined with lexical scoping

The following code results in a `ReferenceError` at the line shown:

```js example-bad
function test(){
   var foo = 33;
   if(foo) {
      let foo = (foo + 55); // ReferenceError
   }
}
test();
```

The `if` block is evaluated because the outer `var foo` has a
value. However due to lexical scoping this value is not available inside the block: the
identifier `foo` _inside_ the `if` block is the
`let foo`. The expression `(foo + 55)` throws
a `ReferenceError` because initialization of `let foo` has not
completed — it is still in the temporal dead zone.

This phenomenon can be confusing in a situation like the following. The instruction
`let n of n.a` is already inside the private scope of the for loop's block.
So, the identifier `n.a` is resolved to the property '`a`' of the
'`n`' object located in the first part of the instruction itself
(`let n`).

This is still in the temporal dead zone as its declaration statement has not been
reached and terminated.

```js example-bad
function go(n) {
  // n here is defined!
  console.log(n); // Object {a: [1,2,3]}

  for (let n of n.a) { // ReferenceError
    console.log(n);
  }
}

go({a: [1, 2, 3]});
```

### Other situations

When used inside a block, **`let`** limits the variable's scope
to that block. Note the difference between **`var`**, whose
scope is inside the function where it is declared.

```js
var a = 1;
var b = 2;

if (a === 1) {
  var a = 11; // the scope is global
  let b = 22; // the scope is inside the if-block

  console.log(a);  // 11
  console.log(b);  // 22
}

console.log(a); // 11
console.log(b); // 2
```

However, this combination of **`var`** and
**`let`** declaration below is a {{jsxref("SyntaxError")}} due
to **`var`** being hoisted to the top of the block. This results
in an implicit re-declaration of the variable.

```js example-bad
let x = 1;

{
  var x = 2; // SyntaxError for re-declaration
}
```
