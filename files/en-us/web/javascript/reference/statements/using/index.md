{{jsSidebar("Statements")}}

The **`using`** declaration declares block-scoped local variables that implement explicit resource management. The semantics are similar to {{jsxref("Statements/const", "const")}}, but additionally, the resource's [well-known](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol#well-known_symbols) `Symbol.dispose` method is automatically run when it goes out of scope, even if an error was thrown.

This is useful for managing resources that need to be released when they are no longer needed, such as file handles, network connections, or database connections.

{{InteractiveExample("JavaScript Demo: using declaration")}}

```js interactive-example
{
  using resource = {
    [Symbol.dispose]() {
      console.log("dispose");
    },
  };

  console.log("end of scope");
}

// 1. logs "end of scope"
// 2. logs "dispose"
```

## Syntax

```js-nolint
using name1 = value1;
using name1 = value1, name2 = value2;
using name1 = value1, name2 = value2, /* â€¦, */ nameN = valueN;
```

- `nameN`
  - : The name of the variable to declare. Each must be a legal JavaScript [identifier](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#identifiers).
- `valueN`
  - : Initial value of the variable. It must have a `Symbol.dispose` method, which will be called when the variable goes out of scope.

## Description

The `using` declaration is similar to {{jsxref("Statements/const", "const")}}:

- `using` declarations are scoped to blocks as well as functions.
- `using` declarations can only be accessed after the place of declaration is reached (see [temporal dead zone](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#temporal_dead_zone_tdz)). For this reason, `const` declarations are commonly regarded as [non-hoisted](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Hoisting).
- `using` declarations do not create properties on {{jsxref("globalThis")}} when declared at the top level of a script.
- `using` declarations cannot be [redeclared](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#redeclarations) by any other declaration in the same scope.
- `using` begins [_declarations_, not _statements_](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements#difference_between_statements_and_declarations). That means you cannot use a lone `const` declaration as the body of a block (which makes sense, since there's no way to access the variable).

  ```js-nolint example-bad
  if (true) using a = 1; // SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier 'a'
  ```

An initializer is required. You must specify its value in the same declaration. (This makes sense, given that it can't be changed later.)

```js-nolint example-bad
using FOO; // SyntaxError: Missing initializer in using declaration
```

Unlike `const`, `using` declarations cannot be [destructured](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring) within the declaration itself:

```js-nolint example-bad
using { prop } = { /* ... */ }; // SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{'
```

If destructuring is needed, it must be done separately:

```js
using resource = {
  /* ... */
};
const { prop } = resource;
```

## Examples

### Reading a file with automatic cleanup

This simplified example simply logs file operations to the console. In a real-world scenario, you would use this pattern to manage file handles or other resources that need to be cleaned up after use.

```js
class FileHandle {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    console.log(`Opening file ${name}`);
  }

  async read() {
    console.log(`File ${this.name} read successfully!`);
  }

  [Symbol.dispose]() {
    console.log(`Closing file ${this.name}`);
  }
}

{
  using file = new FileHandle("example.txt");
  await file.read();
}
// Opening file example.txt
// File example.txt read successfully!
// Closing file example.txt
```

### Error during file reading

In this case, an error is thrown, but the cleanup code in the `Symbol.dispose` method is still executed.

```js
class FileHandle {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    console.log(`Opening file ${name}`);
  }

  async read() {
    throw new Error("There was an error reading the file!");
  }

  [Symbol.dispose]() {
    console.log(`Closing file ${this.name}`);
  }
}

{
  using file = new FileHandle("example.txt");
  await file.read();
}
// Opening file example.txt
// Closing file example.txt
// Uncaught Error: There was an error reading the file!
```
