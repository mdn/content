{{jsSidebar("Statements")}}

The **`continue` statement** terminates execution of the
statements in the current iteration of the current or labeled loop, and continues
execution of the loop with the next iteration.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/statement-continue.html")}}

## Syntax

```js
continue [label];
```

- `label` {{optional_inline}}
  - : Identifier associated with the label of the statement.

## Description

In contrast to the {{jsxref("Statements/break", "break")}} statement,
`continue` does not terminate the execution of the loop entirely: instead,

- In a {{jsxref("Statements/while", "while")}} loop, it jumps back to the condition.

<!---->

- In a {{jsxref("Statements/for", "for")}} loop, it jumps to the update expression.

The `continue` statement can include an optional label that allows the
program to jump to the next iteration of a labeled loop statement instead of the current
loop. In this case, the `continue` statement needs to be nested within this
labeled statement.

## Examples

### Using continue with while

The following example shows a {{jsxref("Statements/while", "while")}} loop that has a
`continue` statement that executes when the value of `i` is 3.
Thus, `n` takes on the values 1, 3, 7, and 12.

```js
var i = 0;
var n = 0;

while (i < 5) {
  i++;

  if (i === 3) {
    continue;
  }

  n += i;
}
```

### Using continue with a label

In the following example, a statement labeled `checkiandj` contains a
statement labeled `checkj`. If `continue` is encountered, the
program continues at the top of the `checkj` statement. Each time
`continue` is encountered, `checkj` reiterates until its condition
returns false. When false is returned, the remainder of the `checkiandj`
statement is completed.

If `continue` had a label of `checkiandj`, the program would
continue at the top of the `checkiandj` statement.

```js
var i = 0;
var j = 8;

checkiandj: while (i < 4) {
  console.log("i: " + i);
  i += 1;

  checkj: while (j > 4) {
    console.log("j: " + j);
    j -= 1;

    if (j % 2 == 0) continue checkj;
    console.log(j + " is odd.");
  }
  console.log("i = " + i);
  console.log("j = " + j);
}
```

Output:

```js
i: 0

// start checkj
j: 8
7 is odd.
j: 7
j: 6
5 is odd.
j: 5
// end checkj

i = 1
j = 4

i: 1
i = 2
j = 4

i: 2
i = 3
j = 4

i: 3
i = 4
j = 4
```
