> **Note:** Use of the `with` statement is not recommended, as it may be the source of confusing bugs and compatibility issues, makes optimization impossible, and is forbidden in [strict mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode). The recommended alternative is to assign the object whose properties you want to access to a temporary variable.

The **`with`** statement extends the scope chain for a statement.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
with (expression)
  statement
```

- `expression`
  - : Adds the given expression to the scope chain used when evaluating the statement. The parentheses around the expression are required.
- `statement`
  - : Any statement. To execute multiple statements, use a [block](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/block) statement (`{ ... }`) to group those statements.

## Description

There are two types of identifiers: a _qualified_ identifier and an _unqualified_ identifier. An unqualified identifier is one that does not indicate where it comes from.

```js
foo; // unqualified identifier
foo.bar; // bar is a qualified identifier
```

Normally, an unqualified identifier is resolved by searching the scope chain for a variable with that name, while a qualified identifier is resolved by searching the prototype chain of an object for a property with that name.

```js
const foo = { bar: 1 };
console.log(foo.bar);
// foo is found in the scope chain as a variable;
// bar is found in foo as a property
```

One exception to this is the [global object](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Global_object), which sits on top of the scope chain, and whose properties automatically become global variables that can be referred to without qualifiers.

```js
console.log(globalThis.Math === Math); // true
```

The `with` statement adds the given object to the head of this scope chain during the evaluation of its statement body. Every unqualified name would first be searched within the object (through a [`in`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/in) check) before searching in the upper scope chain.

Note that if the unqualified reference refers to a method of the object, the method is called with the object as its `this` value.

```js
with ([1, 2, 3]) {
  console.log(toString()); // 1,2,3
}
```

The object may have an [`@@unscopables`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/unscopables) property, which defines a list of properties that should not be added to the scope chain (for backward compatibility). See the [`Symbol.unscopables`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/unscopables) documentation for more information.

The reasons to use a `with` statement include saving one temporary variable and reducing file size by avoiding repeating a lengthy object reference. However, there are far more reasons why `with` statements are not desirable:

- Performance: The `with` statement forces the specified object to be searched first for all name lookups. Therefore, all identifiers that aren't members of the specified object will be found more slowly in a `with` block. Moreover, the optimizer cannot make any assumptions about what each unqualified identifier refers to, so it must repeat the same property lookup every time the identifier is used.
- Readability: The `with` statement makes it hard for a human reader or JavaScript compiler to decide whether an unqualified name will be found along the scope chain, and if so, in which object. For example:

  ```js
  function f(x, o) {
    with (o) {
      console.log(x);
    }
  }
  ```

  If you look just at the definition of `f`, it's impossible to tell what the `x` in the `with` body refers to. Only when `f` is called can `x` be determined to be `o.x` or `f`'s first formal parameter. If you forget to define `x` in the object you pass as the second parameter, you won't get an error — instead you'll just get unexpected results. It's also unclear what the actual intent of such code would be.

- Forward compatibility: Code using `with` may not be forward compatible, especially when used with something other than a plain object, which may gain more properties in the future. Consider this example:

  ```js
  function f(foo, values) {
    with (foo) {
      console.log(values);
    }
  }
  ```

  If you call `f([1, 2, 3], obj)` in an ECMAScript 5 environment, the `values` reference inside the `with` statement will resolve to `obj`. However, ECMAScript 2015 introduces a [`values`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/values) property on `Array.prototype` (so it will be available on every array). So, after upgrading the environment, the `values` reference inside the `with` statement resolves to `[1, 2, 3].values` instead, and is likely to cause bugs.

  In this particular example, `values` is defined as unscopable through [`Array.prototype[@@unscopables]`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/@@unscopables), so it still correctly resolves to the `values` parameter. If it were not defined as unscopable, one can see how this would be a difficult issue to debug.

## Examples

### Using the with statement

The following `with` statement specifies that the {{jsxref("Math")}} object is the default object. The statements following the `with` statement refer to the {{jsxref("Math.PI", "PI")}} property and the {{jsxref("Math.cos", "cos")}} and {{jsxref("Math.sin", "sin")}} methods, without specifying an object. JavaScript assumes the `Math` object for these references.

```js
let a, x, y;
const r = 10;

with (Math) {
  a = PI * r * r;
  x = r * cos(PI);
  y = r * sin(PI / 2);
}
```

### Avoiding the with statement by destructuring properties into the current scope

You can usually avoid using `with` through [property destructuring](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment). Here we create an extra block to mimic the behavior of `with` creating an extra scope — but in actual usage, this block can usually be omitted.

```js
let a, x, y;
const r = 10;

{
  const { PI, cos, sin } = Math;
  a = PI * r * r;
  x = r * cos(PI);
  y = r * sin(PI / 2);
}
```

### Creating dynamic namespaces using the with statement and a proxy

`with` will transform every variable lookup to a property lookup, while [Proxies](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) allow trapping every property lookup call. You can create a dynamic namespace by combining them.

```js
const namespace = new Proxy(
  {},
  {
    has(target, key) {
      // Avoid trapping global properties like `console`
      if (key in globalThis) {
        return false;
      }
      // Trap all property lookups
      return true;
    },
    get(target, key) {
      return key;
    },
  },
);

with (namespace) {
  console.log(a, b, c); // "a" "b" "c"
}
```
