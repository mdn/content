  <p><strong>Warning:</strong>Use of the <code>with</code> statement is not recommended, as it may
  be the source of confusing bugs and compatibility issues. See the "Ambiguity Contra"
  paragraph in the "Description" section below for details.</p>

<p>The <strong>with statement</strong> extends the scope chain for a statement.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">with (<var>expression</var>)
  <var>statement</var>

  <dt><code><var>expression</var></code></dt>

  <dt><code><var>statement</var></code></dt>
  <dd>Any statement. To execute multiple statements, use a <a

</dl>

<h2 id="Description">Description</h2>

<p>JavaScript looks up an unqualified name by searching a scope chain associated with the
  execution context of the script or function containing that unqualified name. The 'with'
  statement adds the given object to the head of this scope chain during the evaluation of
  its statement body. If an unqualified name used in the body matches a property in the
  scope chain, then the name is bound to the property and the object containing the
  property. Otherwise a {{jsxref("ReferenceError")}} is thrown.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Using <code>with</code> is not recommended, and is forbidden in
  ECMAScript 5 <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/Strict_mode">strict
    mode</a>. The recommended alternative is to assign the object whose properties you
  want to access to a temporary variable.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="Performance_pro_contra">Performance pro &amp; contra</h3>

<p><strong>Pro:</strong> The <code>with</code> statement can help reduce file size by
  reducing the need to repeat a lengthy object reference without performance penalty. The
  scope chain change required by 'with' is not computationally expensive. Use of 'with'
  will relieve the interpreter of parsing repeated object references. Note, however, that
  in many cases this benefit can be achieved by using a temporary variable to store a
  reference to the desired object.</p>

<p><strong>Contra:</strong> The <code>with</code> statement forces the specified object to
  be searched first for all name lookups. Therefore all identifiers that aren't members of
  the specified object will be found more slowly in a 'with' block. Where performance is
  important, 'with' should only be used to encompass code blocks that access members of
  the specified object.</p>

<h3 id="Ambiguity_contra">Ambiguity contra</h3>

<p><strong>Contra:</strong> The <code>with</code> statement makes it hard for a human
  reader or JavaScript compiler to decide whether an unqualified name will be found along
  the scope chain, and if so, in which object. So given this example:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function f(x, o) {
  with (o) {
    console.log(x);
  }
}</pre>

<p>Only when <code>f</code> is called is <code>x</code> either found or not, and if found,
  either in <code>o</code> or (if no such property exists) in <code>f</code>'s activation
  object, where <code>x</code> names the first formal argument. If you forget to define
  <code>x</code> in the object you pass as the second argument, or if there's some similar
  bug or confusion, you won't get an error -- just unexpected results.</p>

<p><strong>Contra:</strong> Code using <code>with</code> may not be forward compatible,
  especially when used with something other than a plain object. Consider this example:
</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function f(foo, values) {
  with (foo) {
    console.log(values);
  }
}
</pre>

<p>If you call <code>f([1,2,3], obj)</code> in an ECMAScript 5 environment, then the
  <code>values</code> reference inside the <code>with</code> statement will resolve to
  <code>obj</code>. However, ECMAScript 2015 introduces a <code>values</code> property
  on {{jsxref("Array.prototype")}} (so that it will be available on every array). So, in
  a JavaScript environment that supports ECMAScript 2015, the <code>values</code>
  reference inside the <code>with</code> statement could resolve to
  <code>[1,2,3].values</code>. However, in this particular example,
  {{jsxref("Array.prototype")}} has been defined with <code>values</code> in its
  {{jsxref("Symbol.unscopables")}} object. If it were not, one can see how this would be
  a difficult issue to debug.</p>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<h3 id="Using_with">Using with</h3>

<p>The following <code>with</code> statement specifies that the {{jsxref("Math")}} object
  is the default object. The statements following the <code>with</code> statement refer to
  the {{jsxref("Math.PI", "PI")}} property and the {{jsxref("Math.cos", "cos")}} and
  {{jsxref("Math.sin", "sin")}} methods, without specifying an object. JavaScript assumes
  the <code>Math</code> object for these references.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">let a, x, y;
const r = 10;

with (Math) {
  a = PI * r * r;
  x = r * cos(PI);
  y = r * sin(PI / 2);
}</pre>
