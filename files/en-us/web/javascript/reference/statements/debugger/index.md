The **`debugger`** statement invokes any available debugging
functionality, such as setting a breakpoint. If no debugging functionality is available,
this statement has no effect.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
debugger;
```

## Examples

### Using the debugger statement

The following example shows code where a `debugger` statement has been
inserted, to invoke a debugger (if one exists) when the function is called.

```js
function potentiallyBuggyCode() {
  debugger;
  // do potentially buggy stuff to examine, step through, etc.
}
```

When the debugger is invoked, execution is paused at the `debugger`
statement. It is like a breakpoint in the script source.
