## Strict Mode Overview

> **Note:** Sometimes you'll see the default, non-strict mode referred to as _[sloppy mode](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Sloppy_mode)_. This isn't an official term, but be aware of it, just in case.

JavaScript's strict mode is a way to _opt in_ to a restricted variant of JavaScript, thereby implicitly opting-out of "[sloppy mode](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Sloppy_mode)". Strict mode isn't just a subset: it _intentionally_ has different semantics from normal code. Browsers not supporting strict mode will run strict mode code with different behavior from browsers that do, so don't rely on strict mode without feature-testing for support for the relevant aspects of strict mode. Strict mode code and non-strict mode code can coexist, so scripts can opt into strict mode incrementally.

Strict mode makes several changes to normal JavaScript semantics:

1. Eliminates some JavaScript silent errors by changing them to throw errors.
2. Fixes mistakes that make it difficult for JavaScript engines to perform optimizations: strict mode code can sometimes be made to run faster than identical code that's not strict mode.
3. Prohibits some syntax likely to be defined in future versions of ECMAScript.

See [transitioning to strict mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode/Transitioning_to_strict_mode), if you want to change your code to work in the restricted variant of JavaScript.

## Invoking strict mode

Strict mode applies to _entire scripts_ or to _individual functions_. It doesn't apply to block statements enclosed in `{}` braces; attempting to apply it to such contexts does nothing. `eval` code, `Function` code, event handler attributes, strings passed to [`setTimeout()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout), and related functions are entire scripts, and invoking strict mode in them works as expected.

### Strict mode for scripts

To invoke strict mode for an entire script, put the _exact_ statement `"use strict";` (or `'use strict';`) before any other statements.

```js
// Whole-script strict mode syntax
'use strict';
const v = "Hi! I'm a strict mode script!";
```

### Strict mode for functions

Likewise, to invoke strict mode for a function, put the _exact_ statement `"use strict";` (or `'use strict';`) in the function's body before any other statements.

```js
function myStrictFunction() {
  // Function-level strict mode syntax
  'use strict';
  function nested() {
    return 'And so am I!';
  }
  return `Hi! I'm a strict mode function! ${nested()}`;
}
function myNotStrictFunction() {
  return "I'm not strict.";
}
```

In strict mode, starting with ES2015, functions inside blocks are scoped to that block. Prior to ES2015, block-level functions were forbidden in strict mode.

### Strict mode for modules

ECMAScript 2015 introduced [JavaScript modules](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export) and therefore a 3rd way to enter strict mode. The entire contents of JavaScript modules are automatically in strict mode, with no statement needed to initiate it.

```js
function myStrictFunction() {
  // because this is a module, I'm strict by default
}
export default myStrictFunction;
```

### Strict mode for classes

All parts of ECMAScript [classes](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) are strict mode code, including both [class declarations](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#class_declarations) and [class expressions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#class_expressions) — and so also including all parts of class bodies.

## Changes in strict mode

Strict mode changes both syntax and runtime behavior. Changes generally fall into these categories: changes converting mistakes into errors (as syntax errors or at runtime), changes simplifying how the particular variable for a given use of a name is computed, changes simplifying `eval` and `arguments`, changes making it easier to write "secure" JavaScript, and changes anticipating future ECMAScript evolution.

### Converting mistakes into errors

Strict mode changes some previously-accepted mistakes into errors. JavaScript was designed to be easy for novice developers, and sometimes it gives operations which should be errors non-error semantics. Sometimes this fixes the immediate problem, but sometimes this creates worse problems in the future. Strict mode treats these mistakes as errors so that they're discovered and promptly fixed.

First, strict mode makes it impossible to accidentally create global variables. In normal JavaScript mistyping a variable in an assignment creates a new property on the global object and continues to "work" (although future failure is possible: likely, in modern JavaScript). Assignments, which would accidentally create global variables, instead throw an error in strict mode:

```js
'use strict';
let mistypeVariable;

mistypeVarible = 17;  // Assuming no global variable mistypeVarible exists
                      // this line throws a ReferenceError due to the
                      // misspelling of "mistypeVariable" (lack of an "a")
```

Second, strict mode makes assignments which would otherwise silently fail to throw an exception. For example, `NaN` is a non-writable global variable. In normal code assigning to `NaN` does nothing; the developer receives no failure feedback. In strict mode assigning to `NaN` throws an exception. Any assignment that silently fails in normal code (assignment to a non-writable global or property, assignment to a getter-only property, assignment to a new property on a [non-extensible](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/preventExtensions) object) will throw in strict mode:

```js
'use strict';

// Assignment to a non-writable global
var undefined = 5; // throws a TypeError
var Infinity = 5; // throws a TypeError

// Assignment to a non-writable property
const obj1 = {};
Object.defineProperty(obj1, 'x', { value: 42, writable: false });
obj1.x = 9; // throws a TypeError

// Assignment to a getter-only property
const obj2 = { get x() { return 17; } };
obj2.x = 5; // throws a TypeError

// Assignment to a new property on a non-extensible object
const fixed = {};
Object.preventExtensions(fixed);
fixed.newProp = 'ohai'; // throws a TypeError
```

Third, attempts to delete undeletable properties throw in strict mode (where before the attempt would have no effect):

```js
'use strict';
delete Object.prototype; // throws a TypeError
```

Fourth, strict mode requires that function parameter names be unique. In normal code the last duplicated argument hides previous identically-named arguments. Those previous arguments remain available through `arguments[i]`, so they're not completely inaccessible. Still, this hiding makes little sense and is probably undesirable (it might hide a typo, for example), so in strict mode duplicate argument names are a syntax error:

```js example-bad
function sum(a, a, c) { // !!! syntax error
  'use strict';
  return a + a + c; // wrong if this code ran
}
```

Fifth, strict mode [forbids a `0`-prefixed octal literal or octal escape sequence](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Deprecated_octal). Outside strict mode, a number beginning with a `0`, such as `0644`, is interpreted as an octal number (`0644 === 420`), if all digits are smaller than 8. Octal escape sequences, such as `"\45"`, which is equal to `"%"`, can be used to represent characters by extended-ASCII character code numbers in octal. In strict mode, this is a syntax error. The standardized way to denote octal literals is via the `0o` prefix. For example:

```js
const a = 0o10;
```

Novice developers sometimes believe a leading zero prefix has no semantic meaning, so they might use it as an alignment device — but this changes the number's meaning! A leading zero syntax for the octal is rarely useful and can be mistakenly used, so strict mode makes it a syntax error:

```js example-bad
'use strict';
const sum = 015 + // !!! syntax error
            197 +
            142;

const sumWithOctal = 0o10 + 8;
console.log(sumWithOctal); // 16
```

Sixth, strict mode forbids setting properties on [primitive](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive) values. Without strict mode, setting properties is ignored (no-op), with strict mode, however, a {{jsxref("TypeError")}} is thrown.

```js
'use strict';

false.true = '';         // TypeError
(14).sailing = 'home';   // TypeError
'with'.you = 'far away'; // TypeError
```

Duplicate property names used to be considered a {{jsxref("SyntaxError")}} in strict mode. With the introduction of [computed property names](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer), making duplication possible at runtime, this restriction was removed in ES2015.

```js
'use strict';
const o = { p: 1, p: 2 }; // syntax error prior to ECMAScript 2015
```

> **Note:** Making code that used to error become non-errors is always considered backwards-compatible. This is a good part of the language being strict about throwing errors: it leaves room for future semantic changes.

### Simplifying variable uses

Strict mode simplifies how variable names map to particular variable definitions in the code. Many compiler optimizations rely on the ability to say that variable _X_ is stored in _that_ location: this is critical to fully optimizing JavaScript code. JavaScript sometimes makes this basic mapping of name to variable definition in the code impossible to perform until runtime. Strict mode removes most cases where this happens, so the compiler can better optimize strict mode code.

First, strict mode prohibits [`with`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/with). The problem with `with` is that any name inside the block might map either to a property of the object passed to it, or to a variable in surrounding (or even global) scope, at runtime; it's impossible to know which beforehand. Strict mode makes `with` a syntax error, so there's no chance for a name in a `with` to refer to an unknown location at runtime:

```js example-bad
'use strict';
const x = 17;
with (obj) { // !!! syntax error
  // If this weren't strict mode, would this be const x, or
  // would it instead be obj.x?  It's impossible in general
  // to say without running the code, so the name can't be
  // optimized.
  x;
}
```

The simple alternative of assigning the object to a short name variable, then accessing the corresponding property on that variable, stands ready to replace `with`.

Second, [`eval` of strict mode code does not introduce new variables into the surrounding scope](https://whereswalden.com/2011/01/10/new-es5-strict-mode-support-new-vars-created-by-strict-mode-eval-code-are-local-to-that-code-only/). In normal code `eval("var x;")` introduces a variable `x` into the surrounding function or the global scope. This means that, in general, in a function containing a call to `eval` every name not referring to an argument or local variable must be mapped to a particular definition at runtime (because that `eval` might have introduced a new variable that would hide the outer variable). In strict mode `eval` creates variables only for the code being evaluated, so `eval` can't affect whether a name refers to an outer variable or some local variable:

```js
var x = 17;
var evalX = eval("'use strict'; var x = 42; x;");
console.assert(x === 17);
console.assert(evalX === 42);
```

If the function `eval` is invoked by an expression of the form `eval(...)` in strict mode code, the code will be evaluated as strict mode code. The code may explicitly invoke strict mode, but it's unnecessary to do so.

```js
function strict1(str) {
  'use strict';
  return eval(str); // str will be treated as strict mode code
}
function strict2(f, str) {
  'use strict';
  return f(str); // not eval(...): str is strict if and only
                 // if it invokes strict mode
}
function nonstrict(str) {
  return eval(str); // str is strict if and only
                    // if it invokes strict mode
}

strict1("'Strict mode code!'");
strict1("'use strict'; 'Strict mode code!'");
strict2(eval, "'Non-strict code.'");
strict2(eval, "'use strict'; 'Strict mode code!'");
nonstrict("'Non-strict code.'");
nonstrict("'use strict'; 'Strict mode code!'");
```

Thus names in strict mode `eval` code behave identically to names in strict mode code not being evaluated as the result of `eval`.

Third, strict mode forbids deleting plain names. `delete name` in strict mode is a syntax error:

```js example-bad
'use strict';

var x;
delete x; // !!! syntax error

eval('var y; delete y;'); // !!! syntax error
```

### Making `eval` and `arguments` simpler

Strict mode makes `arguments` and `eval` less bizarrely magical. Both involve a considerable amount of magical behavior in normal code: `eval` to add or remove bindings and to change binding values, and `arguments` by its indexed properties aliasing named arguments. Strict mode makes great strides toward treating `eval` and `arguments` as keywords, although full fixes will not come until a future edition of ECMAScript.

First, the names `eval` and `arguments` can't be bound or assigned in language syntax. All these attempts to do so are syntax errors:

```js example-bad
'use strict';
eval = 17;
arguments++;
++eval;
const obj = { set p(arguments) { } };
let eval;
try { } catch (arguments) { }
function x(eval) { }
function arguments() { }
const y = function eval() { };
const f = new Function('arguments', "'use strict'; return 17;");
```

Second, strict mode code doesn't alias properties of `arguments` objects created within it. In normal code within a function whose first argument is `arg`, setting `arg` also sets `arguments[0]`, and vice versa (unless no arguments were provided or `arguments[0]` is deleted). `arguments` objects for strict mode functions store the original arguments when the function was invoked. `arguments[i]` does not track the value of the corresponding named argument, nor does a named argument track the value in the corresponding `arguments[i]`.

```js
function f(a) {
  'use strict';
  a = 42;
  return [a, arguments[0]];
}
const pair = f(17);
console.assert(pair[0] === 42);
console.assert(pair[1] === 17);
```

Third, `arguments.callee` is no longer supported. In normal code `arguments.callee` refers to the enclosing function. This use case is weak: name the enclosing function! Moreover, `arguments.callee` substantially hinders optimizations like inlining functions, because it must be made possible to provide a reference to the un-inlined function if `arguments.callee` is accessed. `arguments.callee` for strict mode functions is a non-deletable property which throws an error when set or retrieved:

```js
'use strict';
const f = function () {
  return arguments.callee;
};
f(); // throws a TypeError
```

### "Securing" JavaScript

Strict mode makes it easier to write "secure" JavaScript. Some websites now provide ways for users to write JavaScript which will be run by the website _on behalf of other users_. JavaScript in browsers can access the user's private information, so such JavaScript must be partially transformed before it is run, to censor access to forbidden functionality. JavaScript's flexibility makes it effectively impossible to do this without many runtime checks. Certain language functions are so pervasive that performing runtime checks has a considerable performance cost. A few strict mode tweaks, plus requiring that user-submitted JavaScript be strict mode code and that it be invoked in a certain manner, substantially reduce the need for those runtime checks.

First, the value passed as `this` to a function in strict mode is not forced into being an object (a.k.a. "boxed"). For a normal function, `this` is always an object: either the provided object if called with an object-valued `this`; the value, boxed, if called with a Boolean, string, or number `this`; or the global object if called with an `undefined` or `null` `this`. (Use [`call`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call), [`apply`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply), or [`bind`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind) to specify a particular `this`.) Not only is automatic boxing a performance cost, but exposing the global object in browsers is a security hazard because the global object provides access to functionality that "secure" JavaScript environments must restrict. Thus for a strict mode function, the specified `this` is not boxed into an object, and if unspecified, `this` will be `undefined`:

```js
'use strict';
function fun() { return this; }
console.assert(fun() === undefined);
console.assert(fun.call(2) === 2);
console.assert(fun.apply(null) === null);
console.assert(fun.call(undefined) === undefined);
console.assert(fun.bind(true)());
```

Second, in strict mode it's no longer possible to "walk" the JavaScript stack via commonly-implemented extensions to ECMAScript. In normal code with these extensions, when a function `fun` is in the middle of being called, `fun.caller` is the function that most recently called `fun`, and `fun.arguments` is the `arguments` for that invocation of `fun`. Both extensions are problematic for "secure" JavaScript because they allow "secured" code to access "privileged" functions and their (potentially unsecured) arguments. If `fun` is in strict mode, both `fun.caller` and `fun.arguments` are non-deletable properties which throw when set or retrieved:

```js
function restricted() {
  'use strict';
  restricted.caller;    // throws a TypeError
  restricted.arguments; // throws a TypeError
}
function privilegedInvoker() {
  return restricted();
}
privilegedInvoker();
```

## Strict mode in browsers

The major browsers have fully implemented strict mode since approximately 2012, including [IE since version 10, Firefox since version 4. Chrome since version 13, etc](https://caniuse.com/use-strict). If you still support very old JS environments prior to the roll-outs of strict mode support, be careful to test any of your code that declares strict mode code to verify that its expected behaviors aren't violated when running in non-strict mode conforming JS engines.

There are however some nuances to consider with how strict mode behaves in browsers.

Strict mode prohibits function statements that are not at the top level of a script or function. In normal mode in browsers, function statements are permitted "everywhere". _This is not part of ES5 (or even ES3)!_ It's an extension with incompatible semantics in different browsers. Note that function statements outside top level are permitted in ES2015.

For example, these block-level function declarations should be disallowed in strict mode by the specification's text proper:

```js
'use strict';
if (true) {
  function f() { } // !!! syntax error
  f();
}

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  function f2() { } // !!! syntax error
  f2();
}

function baz() { // kosher
  function eit() { } // also kosher
}
```

However, [Appendix B of the specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-additional-ecmascript-features-for-web-browsers) recognizes _on-the-ground reality_ of how code has behaved historically in the majority of JS engines/environments, particularly JS engines used by web browsers (including the engine used by Node.js). As such, while strict mode in the specification in proper restricts function declarations _not_ at the top level of a script or function, [Appendix B's "Block-Level Function Declarations Web Legacy Compatibility Semantics"](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-block-level-function-declarations-web-legacy-compatibility-semantics) modifies (reduces or removes) this restriction for the applicable JS environments.
