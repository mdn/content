This page describes JavaScript's lexical grammar. JavaScript source text is just a sequence of characters — in order for the interpreter to understand it, the string has to be _parsed_ to a more structured representation. The initial step of parsing is called [lexical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis), in which the text gets scanned from left to right and is converted into a sequence of individual, atomic input elements. Some input elements are insignificant to the interpreter, and will be stripped after this step — they include control characters, line terminators, [white space](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Whitespace), and comments. The others, such as identifiers and punctuators, will be used for further syntax analysis. ECMAScript also defines certain keywords and literals and has rules for automatic insertion of semicolons to make certain invalid token sequences become valid.

## Format-control characters

Format-control characters have no visual representation but are used to control the interpretation of the text.

| Code point | Name                  | Abbreviation | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------- | --------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `U+200C`   | Zero width non-joiner | \<ZWNJ>      | Placed between characters to prevent being connected into ligatures in certain languages ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_non-joiner)).                                                                   |
| `U+200D`   | Zero width joiner     | \<ZWJ>       | Placed between characters that would not normally be connected in order to cause the characters to be rendered using their connected form in certain languages ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-width_joiner)). |
| `U+FEFF`   | Byte order mark       | \<BOM>       | Used at the start of the script to mark it as Unicode and the text's byte order ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark)).                                                                                  |

In JavaScript source text, \<ZWNJ> and \<ZWJ> are treated as identifier parts, while \<BOM> (also called a zero-width no-break space \<ZWNBSP> when not at the start of text) is treated as whitespace.

## White space

[White space](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Whitespace) characters improve the readability of source text and separate tokens from each other. These characters are usually unnecessary for the functionality of the code. [Minification tools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_%28programming%29) are often used to remove whitespace in order to reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred.

| Code point | Name                           | Abbreviation | Description                                                                                               | Escape sequence |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| U+0009     | Character tabulation           | \<TAB>       | Horizontal tabulation                                                                                     | \t              |
| U+000B     | Line tabulation                | \<VT>        | Vertical tabulation                                                                                       | \v              |

| U+00A0     | No-break space                 | \<NBSP>      | Normal space, but no point at which a line may break                                                      |                 |
| Others     | Other Unicode space characters | \<USP>       | [Spaces in Unicode on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_%28punctuation%29#Spaces_in_Unicode) |                 |

## Line terminators

In addition to [white space](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Whitespace) characters, line terminator characters are used to improve the readability of the source text. However, in some cases, line terminators can influence the execution of JavaScript code as there are a few places where they are forbidden. Line terminators also affect the process of [automatic semicolon insertion](#automatic_semicolon_insertion). Line terminators are matched by the `\s` class in [regular expressions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions).

Only the following Unicode code points are treated as line terminators in ECMAScript, other line breaking characters are treated as white space (for example, Next Line, NEL, U+0085 is considered as white space).

| Code point | Name                | Abbreviation | Description                                            | Escape sequence |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| U+000A     | Line Feed           | \<LF>        | New line character in UNIX systems.                    | \n              |
| U+000D     | Carriage Return     | \<CR>        | New line character in Commodore and early Mac systems. | \r              |
| U+2028     | Line Separator      | \<LS>        | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline)     |                 |

## Comments

Comments are used to add hints, notes, suggestions, or warnings to JavaScript code. This can make it easier to read and understand. They can also be used to disable code to prevent it from being executed; this can be a valuable debugging tool.

JavaScript has two long-standing ways to add comments to code.

The first way is the `//` comment; this makes all text following it on the same line into a comment. For example:

```js
function comment() {
  // This is a one line JavaScript comment
  console.log('Hello world!');
}
comment();
```

The second way is the `/* */` style, which is much more flexible.

For example, you can use it on a single line:

```js
function comment() {
  /* This is a one line JavaScript comment */
  console.log('Hello world!');
}
comment();
```

You can also make multiple-line comments, like this:

```js
function comment() {
  /* This comment spans multiple lines. Notice
     that we don't need to end the comment until we're done. */
  console.log('Hello world!');
}
comment();
```

You can also use it in the middle of a line, if you wish, although this can make your code harder to read so it should be used with caution:

```js
function comment(x) {
  console.log('Hello ' + x /* insert the value of x */ + ' !');
}
comment('world');
```

In addition, you can use it to disable code to prevent it from running, by wrapping code in a comment, like this:

```js
function comment() {
  /* console.log('Hello world!'); */
}
comment();
```

In this case, the `console.log()` call is never issued, since it's inside a comment. Any number of lines of code can be disabled this way.

There's a special third comment syntax, the **hashbang comment**. A hashbang comment behaves exactly like a single line-only (`//`) comment, except that it begins with `#!` and **is only valid at the absolute start of a script or module**. Note also that no whitespace of any kind is permitted before the `#!`. The comment consists of all the characters after `#!` up to the end of the first line; only one such comment is permitted.

Hashbang comments in JavaScript resemble [shebangs in Unix](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>) which provide the path to a specific JavaScript interpreter that you want to use to execute the script. Before the hashbang comment became standardized, it had already been de-facto implemented in non-browser hosts like Node.js, where it was stripped from the source text before being passed to the engine. An example is as follows:

```js
#!/usr/bin/env node

console.log("Hello world");
```

The JavaScript interpreter will treat it as a normal comment — it only has semantic meaning to the shell if the script is directly run in a shell.

> **Warning:** If you want scripts to be runnable directly in a shell environment, encode them in UTF-8 without a [BOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark). Although a BOM will not cause any problems for code running in a browser, it is not advised to use a BOM with a hashbang in a script — because the BOM will prevent the script from working when you try to run it in a Unix/Linux shell environment. So if you want scripts to be runnable directly in a shell environment, encode them in UTF-8 without a BOM.

You must only use the `#!` comment style to specify a JavaScript interpreter. In all other cases just use a `//` comment (or multiline comment).

## Identifiers

An _identifier_ is used to link a value with a name. Identifiers can be used in various places:

```js
const decl = 1; // Variable declaration (may also be `let` or `var`)
function fn() {} // Function declaration
const obj = { key: 'value' }; // Object keys
class C { // Class declaration
  #priv = 'value'; // Private property
}
lbl: console.log(1); // Label
```

In JavaScript, identifiers are commonly made of alphanumeric characters, underscores (`_`), and dollar signs (`$`). Identifiers are not allowed to start with numbers. However, JavaScript identifiers are not only limited to ASCII — most Unicode codepoints are allowed as well.

> **Note:** If, for some reason, you need to parse some JavaScript source yourself, do not assume all identifiers follow the pattern `/[A-Za-z_$][\w$]*/` (i.e. ASCII-only)! The range of identifiers can be described by the regex `/[$_\p{ID_Start}][$\u200c\u200d\p{ID_Continue}]*/u` (excluding unicode escape sequences).

In addition, JavaScript allows using [Unicode escape sequences](#unicode_escape_sequences) in the form of `\u0000` or `\u{000000}` in identifiers, which encode the same string value as the actual Unicode characters. For example, `你好` and `\u4f60\u597d` are the same identifiers:

```js
const 你好 = "Hello";
console.log(\u4f60\u597d); // Hello
```

Not all places accept the full range of identifiers. Certain syntaxes, such as function declarations, function expressions, and variable declarations require using identifiers names that are not [reserved words](#reserved_words).

```js example-bad
function import() {} // Illegal: import is a reserved word.
```

Most notably, private properties and object properties allow reserved words.

```js
const obj = { import: "value" }; // Legal despite `import` being reserved
class C {
  #import = "value";
}
```

## Keywords

_Keywords_ are tokens that look like identifiers but have special meanings in JavaScript. For example, the keyword [`async`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) before a function declaration indicates that the function is asynchronous.

Some keywords are _reserved_, meaning that cannot be used as an identifier for variable declarations, function declarations, etc. They are often called _reserved words_. [A list of these reserved words](#reserved_words) is provided below. Not all keywords are reserved — for example, `async` can be used as an identifier anywhere. Some keywords are only _contextually reserved_ — for example, `await` is only reserved within the body of an async function, and `let` is only reserved in strict mode code, or `const`- and `let`-declarations.

Identifiers are always compared by _string value_, so escape sequences are interpreted. For example, this is still a syntax error:

```js example-bad
const els\u{65} = 1;
// `els\u{65}` encodes the same identifier as `else`
```

### Reserved words

These keywords cannot be used as identifiers for variables, functions, classes, etc. anywhere in JavaScript source.

- {{jsxref("Operators/yield", "yield")}}

The following are only reserved when they are found in strict mode code:

- {{jsxref("Statements/let", "let")}} (also reserved in `const`, `let`, and class declarations)
- {{jsxref("Operators/yield", "yield")}} (also reserved in generator function bodies)

The following are only reserved when they are found in module code or async function bodies:

- [`await`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await)

### Future reserved words

The following are reserved as future keywords by the ECMAScript specification. They have no special functionality at present, but they might at some future time, so they cannot be used as identifiers.

These are always reserved:

- `enum`

The following are only reserved when they are found in strict mode code:

- `implements`
- `interface`
- `package`
- `private`
- `protected`
- `public`

#### Future reserved words in older standards

The following are reserved as future keywords by older ECMAScript specifications (ECMAScript 1 till 3).

- `abstract`
- `boolean`
- `byte`
- `char`
- `double`
- `final`
- `float`
- `goto`
- `int`
- `long`
- `native`
- `short`
- `synchronized`
- `throws`
- `transient`
- `volatile`

### Identifiers with special meanings

A few identifiers have a special meaning in some contexts without being reserved words of any kind. They include:

- {{jsxref("Functions/arguments", "arguments")}} (not a keyword, but cannot be declared as identifier in strict mode)
- [`async`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)
- {{jsxref("Global_Objects/eval", "eval")}} (not a keyword, but cannot be declared as identifier in strict mode)
- {{jsxref("Functions/get", "get")}}
- {{jsxref("Functions/set", "set")}}

## Literals

### Null literal

See also [`null`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/null) for more information.

```js
null
```

### Boolean literal

See also [boolean type](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#boolean_type) for more information.

```js
true
false
```

### Numeric literals

The [Number](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#number_type) and [BigInt](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#bigint_type) types use numeric literals.

#### Decimal

```js
1234567890
42

// Caution when using with a leading zero:
0888 // 888 parsed as decimal
0777 // parsed as octal, 511 in decimal
```

Note that decimal literals can start with a zero (`0`) followed by another decimal digit, but if all digits after the leading `0` are smaller than 8, the number is interpreted as an octal number. Moreover, number literals prefixed with `0`, whether interpreted as octal or decimal, will cause a syntax error in strict mode — so, use the `0o` prefix instead.

##### Exponential

The decimal exponential literal is specified by the following format: `beN`; where `b` is a base number (integer or floating), followed by an `E` or `e` character (which serves as separator or _exponent indicator_) and `N`, which is _exponent_ or _power_ number – a signed integer.

```js
0e-5   // => 0
0e+5   // => 0
5e1    // => 50
175e-2 // => 1.75
1e3    // => 1000
1e-3   // => 0.001
1E3    // => 1000
```

#### Binary

Binary number syntax uses a leading zero followed by a lowercase or uppercase Latin letter "B" (`0b` or `0B`). If the digits after the `0b` are not 0 or 1, the following {{jsxref("SyntaxError")}} is thrown: "Missing binary digits after 0b".

```js
const FLT_SIGNBIT  = 0b10000000000000000000000000000000; // 2147483648
const FLT_EXPONENT = 0b01111111100000000000000000000000; // 2139095040
const FLT_MANTISSA = 0B00000000011111111111111111111111; // 8388607
```

#### Octal

Octal number syntax uses a leading zero followed by a lowercase or uppercase Latin letter "O" (`0o` or `0O)`. If the digits after the `0o` are outside the range (01234567), the following {{jsxref("SyntaxError")}} is thrown: "Missing octal digits after 0o".

```js
const n = 0O755; // 493
const m = 0o644; // 420
```

#### Hexadecimal

Hexadecimal number syntax uses a leading zero followed by a lowercase or uppercase Latin letter "X" (`0x` or `0X`). If the digits after 0x are outside the range (0123456789ABCDEF), the following {{jsxref("SyntaxError")}} is thrown: "Identifier starts immediately after numeric literal".

```js
0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF // 295147905179352830000
0x123456789ABCDEF   // 81985529216486900
0XA                 // 10
```

#### BigInt literal

The [BigInt](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#bigint_type) type is a numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with arbitrary precision. BigInt literals are created by appending `n` to the end of an integer.

```js
123456789123456789n     // 123456789123456789
0o777777777777n         // 68719476735
0x123456789ABCDEFn      // 81985529216486895
0b11101001010101010101n // 955733
```

Note that legacy octal numbers with just a leading zero won't work for `BigInt`:

```js example-bad
0755n
// SyntaxError: invalid BigInt syntax
```

For octal `BigInt` numbers, always use zero followed by the letter "o" (uppercase or lowercase):

```js example-good
0o755n
```

For more information about `BigInt`, see also [JavaScript data structures](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#bigint_type).

#### Numeric separators

To improve readability for numeric literals, underscores (`_`, `U+005F`) can be used as separators:

```js
// separators in decimal numbers
1_000_000_000_000
1_050.95

// separators in binary numbers
0b1010_0001_1000_0101

// separators in octal numbers
0o2_2_5_6

// separators in hex numbers
0xA0_B0_C0

// separators in BigInts
1_000_000_000_000_000_000_000n
```

Note these limitations:

```js example-bad
// More than one underscore in a row is not allowed
100__000; // SyntaxError

// Not allowed at the end of numeric literals
100_; // SyntaxError

// Can not be used after leading 0
0_1; // SyntaxError
```

### Object literals

See also {{jsxref("Object")}} and [Object initializer](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer) for more information.

```js
const o = { a: 'foo', b: 'bar', c: 42 };

// shorthand notation
const a = 'foo', b = 'bar', c = 42;
const o = { a, b, c };

// instead of
const o = { a: a, b: b, c: c };
```

### Array literals

See also {{jsxref("Array")}} for more information.

```js
[1954, 1974, 1990, 2014]
```

### String literals

A [string](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#string_type) literal is zero or more Unicode code points enclosed in single or double quotes. Unicode code points may also be represented by an escape sequence. All code points may appear literally in a string literal except for these closing quote code points:

- U+005C \ (backslash),
- U+000D \<CR>,
- and U+000A \<LF>.

Any code points may appear in the form of an escape sequence. String literals evaluate to ECMAScript String values. When generating these String values Unicode code points are UTF-16 encoded.

```js
'foo';
"bar";
```

#### Hexadecimal escape sequences

Hexadecimal escape sequences consist of `\x` followed by exactly two hexadecimal digits representing a code unit or code point in the range 0x0000 to 0x00FF.

```js
'\xA9' // "©"
```

#### Unicode escape sequences

A Unicode escape sequence consists of exactly four hexadecimal digits following `\u`. It represents a code unit in the UTF-16 encoding. For code points U+0000 to U+FFFF, the code unit is equal to the code point. Code points U+10000 to U+10FFFF require two escape sequences representing the two code units (a surrogate pair) used to encode the character; the surrogate pair is distinct from the code point.

See also {{jsxref("String.fromCharCode()")}} and {{jsxref("String.prototype.charCodeAt()")}}.

```js
'\u00A9' // "©" (U+A9)
```

#### Unicode code point escapes

A Unicode code point escape consists of `\u{`, followed by a code point in hexadecimal base, followed by `}`. The value of the hexadecimal digits must be in the range 0 and 0x10FFFF inclusive. Code points in the range U+10000 to U+10FFFF do not need to be represented as a surrogate pair.

See also {{jsxref("String.fromCodePoint()")}} and {{jsxref("String.prototype.codePointAt()")}}.

```js
'\u{2F804}' // CJK COMPATIBILITY IDEOGRAPH-2F804 (U+2F804)

// the same character represented as a surrogate pair
'\uD87E\uDC04'
```

### Regular expression literals

See also {{jsxref("RegExp")}} for more information.

```js
/ab+c/g;

// An "empty" regular expression literal
// The empty non-capturing group is necessary
// to avoid ambiguity with single-line comments.
/(?:)/;
```

### Template literals

See also [template strings](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) for more information.

```js
`string text`

`string text line 1
 string text line 2`

`string text ${expression} string text`

tag `string text ${expression} string text`
```

## Automatic semicolon insertion

Some [JavaScript statements](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements) must be terminated with semicolons and are therefore affected by automatic semicolon insertion (ASI):

- `let`, `const`, variable statement
- `import`, `export`, module declaration
- Expression statement
- `debugger`
- `continue`, `break`, `throw`
- `return`

There are three cases when semicolons are automatically inserted:

1\. When a token not allowed by the grammar is encountered, and it's separated from the previous token by at least one [line terminator](#line_terminators), or the token is "}", then a semicolon is inserted before the token.

```js
{ 1
2 } 3

// is transformed by ASI into:

{ 1
;2 ;} 3;

// Which is valid grammar encoding three statements,
// each consisting of a number literal
```

The ending ")" of [`do...while`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/do...while) is taken care of as a special case by this rule as well.

```js
do {
  // ...
} while (condition) /* ; */ // ASI here
const a = 1
```

2\. When the end of the input stream of tokens is reached, and the parser is unable to parse the single input stream as a complete program, a semicolon is inserted at the end.

```js
const a = 1 /* ; */ // ASI here
```

This rule is a complement to the previous rule, specifically for the case where there's no "offending token" but the end of input stream.

3\. When the grammar forbids line terminators in some place but a line terminator is found, a semicolon is inserted. These places include:

- `expr <here> ++`, `expr <here> --`
- `continue <here> lbl`
- `break <here> lbl`
- `return <here> expr`
- `throw <here> expr`
- `yield <here> expr`
- `yield <here> * expr`
- `(param) <here> => {}`
- `async <here> function`, `async <here> prop()`, `async <here> function*`, `async <here> *prop()`, `async <here> (param) <here> => {}`

Here `++` is not treated as a [postfix operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#increment) applying to variable `b`, because a line terminator occurs between `b` and `++`.

```js
a = b
++c

// is transformed by ASI into

a = b;
++c;
```

Here the `return` statement returns `undefined`, and the `a + b` becomes an unreachable statement.

```js
return
a + b

// is transformed by ASI into

return;
a + b;
```

Note that ASI would only be triggered if a line break separates tokens that would otherwise produce invalid syntax. If the next token can be parsed as part of a valid structure, semicolons would not be inserted. For example:

```js example-bad
const a = 1
(1).toString()

const b = 1
[1, 2, 3].forEach(console.log)
```

Because `()` can be seen as a function call, it would usually not trigger ASI. Similarly, `[]` may be a member access. The code above is equivalent to:

```js example-bad
const a = 1(1).toString()

const b = 1[1, 2, 3].forEach(console.log)
```

Therefore, you would get errors like "1 is not a function" and "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'forEach')" when running the code.

Within classes, class fields and generator methods can be a pitfall as well.

```js example-bad
class A {
  a = 1
  *gen() {}
}
```

It is seen as:

```js example-bad
class A {
  a = 1 * gen() {}
}
```

And therefore will be a syntax error around `{`.

There are the following rules-of-thumb for dealing with ASI, if you want to enforce semicolon-less style:

- Write postfix `++` and `--` on the same line as their operands.
- The expressions after `return`, `throw`, or `yield` should be on the same line as the keyword.
- Similarly, the label identifier after `break` or `continue` should be on the same line as the keyword.
- The `=>` of an arrow function should be on the same line as the end of its parameters.
- The `async` of async functions, methods, etc. cannot be directly followed by a line terminator.
- If a line starts with one of `(`, `[`, `` ` ``, `+`, `-`, `/` (as in regex literals), prefix it with a semicolon, or end the previous line with a semicolon.
- Class fields should preferably always be ended with semicolons — in addition to the previous rule (which includes a field declaration followed by a [computed property](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#computed_property_names), since the latter starts with `[`), semicolons are also required between a field declaration and a generator method.
