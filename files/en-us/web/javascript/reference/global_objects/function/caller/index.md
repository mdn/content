> **Note:** In [strict mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode), accessing `caller` of a function throws an error â€” the API is removed with no replacement. This is to prevent code from being able to "walk the stack", which both poses security risks and severely limits the possibility of optimizations like inlining and tail-call optimization. For more explanation, you can read [the rationale for the deprecation of `arguments.callee`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments/callee#description).

The **`caller`** accessor property of {{jsxref("Function")}} instances represents the function that invoked this function. For [strict](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode), arrow, async, and generator functions, accessing the `caller` property throws a {{jsxref("TypeError")}}.

## Description

If the function `f` was invoked by the top-level code, the value of `f.caller` is {{jsxref("Operators/null", "null")}}; otherwise it's the function that called `f`. If the function that called `f` is a strict mode function, the value of `f.caller` is also `null`.

Note that the only behavior specified by the ECMAScript specification is that `Function.prototype` has an initial `caller` accessor that unconditionally throws a {{jsxref("TypeError")}} for any `get` or `set` request (known as a "poison pill accessor"), and that implementations are not allowed to change this semantic for any function except non-strict plain functions, in which case it must not have the value of a strict mode function. The actual behavior of the `caller` property, if it's anything other than throwing an error, is implementation-defined. For example, Chrome defines it as an own data property, while Firefox and Safari extend the initial poison-pill `Function.prototype.caller` accessor to specially handle `this` values that are non-strict functions.

```js
(function f() {
  if (Object.hasOwn(f, "caller")) {
    console.log(
      "caller is an own property with descriptor",
      Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(f, "caller")
    );
  } else {
    console.log(
      "f doesn't have an own property named caller. Trying to get f.[[Prototype]].caller"
    );
    console.log(
      Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(
        Object.getPrototypeOf(f),
        "caller"
      ).get.call(f)
    );
  }
})();

// In Chrome:
// caller is an own property with descriptor {value: null, writable: false, enumerable: false, configurable: false}

// In Firefox:
// f doesn't have an own property named caller. Trying to get f.[[Prototype]].caller
// null
```

This property replaces the obsolete `arguments.caller` property of the {{jsxref("Functions/arguments", "arguments")}} object.

The special property `__caller__`, which returned the activation object of the caller thus allowing to reconstruct the stack, was removed for security reasons.

## Examples

### Checking the value of a function's caller property

The following code checks the value a function's `caller` property.

```js
function myFunc() {
  if (myFunc.caller === null) {
    return "The function was called from the top!";
  } else {
    return `This function's caller was ${myFunc.caller}`;
  }
}
```

### Reconstructing the stack and recursion

Note that in case of recursion, you can't reconstruct the call stack using this property. Consider:

```js
function f(n) {
  g(n - 1);
}
function g(n) {
  if (n > 0) {
    f(n);
  } else {
    stop();
  }
}
f(2);
```

At the moment `stop()` is called the call stack will be:

```plain
f(2) -> g(1) -> f(1) -> g(0) -> stop()
```

The following is true:

```js
stop.caller === g && f.caller === g && g.caller === f;
```

so if you tried to get the stack trace in the `stop()` function like this:

```js
let f = stop;
let stack = "Stack trace:";
while (f) {
  stack += `\n${f.name}`;
  f = f.caller;
}
```

the loop would never stop.

### Strict mode caller

If the caller is a strict mode function, the value of `caller` is `null`.

```js
function callerFunc() {
  calleeFunc();
}

function strictCallerFunc() {
  "use strict";
  calleeFunc();
}

function calleeFunc() {
  console.log(calleeFunc.caller);
}

(function () {
  callerFunc();
})();
// Logs [Function: callerFunc]

(function () {
  strictCallerFunc();
})();
// Logs null
```
