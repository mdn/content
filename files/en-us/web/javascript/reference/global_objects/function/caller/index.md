{{JSRef}} {{deprecated_header}}

A {{jsxref("Function")}} object's **`caller`** property returns the function that invoked the specified function. For [strict](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode), async function, and generator function callers, accessing the `caller` property throws an exception.

## Description

If the function `f` was invoked by the top-level code, the value of `f.caller` is {{jsxref("Operators/null", "null")}}, otherwise it's the function that called `f`.

This property replaces the obsolete `arguments.caller` property of the {{jsxref("Functions/arguments", "arguments")}} object.

The special property `__caller__`, which returned the activation object of the caller thus allowing to reconstruct the stack, was removed for security reasons.

Note that in case of recursion, you can't reconstruct the call stack using this property. Consider:

```js
function f(n) { g(n - 1); }
function g(n) { if (n > 0) { f(n); } else { stop(); } }
f(2);
```

At the moment `stop()` is called the call stack will be:

```plain
f(2) -> g(1) -> f(1) -> g(0) -> stop()
```

The following is true:

```js
stop.caller === g && f.caller === g && g.caller === f
```

so if you tried to get the stack trace in the `stop()` function like this:

```js
let f = stop;
let stack = 'Stack trace:';
while (f) {
  stack += '\n' + f.name;
  f = f.caller;
}
```

the loop would never stop.

In [strict mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode), accessing `caller` of a function throws an error. This is to prevent a function from being able to "walk the stack", which both poses security risks and severely limits the possibility of optimizations like inlining and tail-call optimization. For more explanation, you can read [the rationale for the deprecation of `arguments.callee`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments/callee#why_was_arguments.callee_removed_from_es5_strict_mode)

## Examples

### Checking the value of a function's caller property

The following code checks the value a function's `caller` property.

```js
function myFunc() {
  if (myFunc.caller == null) {
    return 'The function was called from the top!';
  } else {
    return 'This function\'s caller was ' + myFunc.caller;
  }
}
```
