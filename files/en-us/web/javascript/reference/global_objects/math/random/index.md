{{JSRef}}

The **`Math.random()`** function returns a floating-point,
pseudo-random number in the range 0 to less than 1 (inclusive of 0, but not 1) with
approximately uniform distribution over that range — which you can then scale to your
desired range. The implementation selects the initial seed to the random number
generation algorithm; it cannot be chosen or reset by the user.

## Syntax

```js
Math.random();
```

### Return value

A floating-point, pseudo-random number between `0` (inclusive) and 1
(exclusive).

## Examples

Note that as numbers in JavaScript are IEEE 754 floating point numbers with
round-to-nearest-even behavior, the ranges claimed for the functions below (excluding
the one for `Math.random()` itself) aren't exact. If extremely large bounds
are chosen (2^53 or higher), it's possible in _extremely_ rare cases to
calculate the usually-excluded upper bound.

### Getting a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive)

```js
function getRandom() {
  return Math.random();
}
```

### Getting a random number between two values

This example returns a random number between the specified values. The returned value
is no lower than (and may possibly equal) `min`, and is less than (and
not equal) `max`.

```js
function getRandomArbitrary(min, max) {
  return Math.random() * (max - min) + min;
}
```

### Getting a random integer between two values

This example returns a random _integer_ between the specified values. The value
is no lower than `min` (or the next integer greater than `min` if
`min` isn't an integer), and is less than (but not equal to)
`max`.

```js
function getRandomInt(min, max) {
  min = Math.ceil(min);
  max = Math.floor(max);
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min) + min); //The maximum is exclusive and the minimum is inclusive
}
```

> **Note:** It might be tempting to use `Math.round()` to accomplish that, but doing
> so would cause your random numbers to follow a non-uniform distribution, which may not
> be acceptable for your needs.

### Getting a random integer between two values, inclusive

While the `getRandomInt()` function above is inclusive at the minimum, it's
exclusive at the maximum. What if you need the results to be inclusive at both the
minimum and the maximum? The `getRandomIntInclusive()` function below
accomplishes that.

```js
function getRandomIntInclusive(min, max) {
  min = Math.ceil(min);
  max = Math.floor(max);
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1) + min); //The maximum is inclusive and the minimum is inclusive
}
```
