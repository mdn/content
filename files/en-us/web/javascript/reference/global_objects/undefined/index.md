{{jsSidebar("Objects")}}

The global **`undefined`** property represents the primitive
value `{{Glossary("Undefined", "undefined")}}`. It is one of JavaScript's
{{Glossary("Primitive", "primitive types")}}.

{{js_property_attributes(0,0,0)}}

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/globalprops-undefined.html")}}

## Syntax

```js
undefined;
```

## Description

`undefined` is a property of the _global object_. That is, it is a
variable in global scope. The initial value of `undefined` is the primitive
value `{{Glossary("Undefined", "undefined")}}`.

In modern browsers (JavaScript 1.8.5 / Firefox 4+), `undefined` is a
non-configurable, non-writable property, per the ECMAScript 5 specification. (Even when
this is not the case, avoid overriding it.)

A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type `undefined`. A
method or statement also returns `undefined` if the variable that is being
evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns `undefined` if
a value was not {{jsxref("Statements/return", "returned")}}.

> **Note:** While you can use `undefined` as an
> {{Glossary("identifier")}} (variable name) in any scope other than the global scope
> (because `undefined` is not a {{jsxref("Reserved_Words", "reserved word",

    "", 1)}}), doing so is a very bad idea that will make your code difficult to maintain

> and debug.

> (function () {
>   var undefined = "foo";
>   console.log(undefined, typeof undefined);
> })();
>
> //  logs "foo string"
> (function (undefined) {
>   console.log(undefined, typeof undefined);
> })("foo");
> ```

## Examples

### Strict equality and undefined

You can use `undefined` and the strict equality and inequality operators to
determine whether a variable has a value. In the following code, the variable
`x` is not initialized, and the `if` statement evaluates to true.

```js
var x;
if (x === undefined) {
  // these statements execute
} else {
  // these statements do not execute
}
```

> **Note:** The _strict equality_ operator (as opposed to the
> _standard equality_ operator) must be used here, because
> `x == undefined` also checks whether `x` is `null`,
> while strict equality doesn't. This is because `null` is not equivalent to
> `undefined`.

### typeof operator and undefined

Alternatively, {{jsxref("Operators/typeof", "typeof")}} can be used:

```js
var x;
if (typeof x === "undefined") {
  // these statements execute
}
```

One reason to use {{jsxref("Operators/typeof", "typeof")}} is that it does not throw an
error if the variable has not been declared.

```js
//  x has not been declared before
if (typeof x === "undefined") {
  //  evaluates to true without errors
  //  these statements execute
}

if (x === undefined) {
  //  throws a ReferenceError
}
```

However, there is another alternative. JavaScript is a statically scoped language, so
knowing if a variable is declared can be read by seeing whether it is declared in an
enclosing context.

The global scope is bound to the {{jsxref("globalThis", "global object", "", 1)}}, so
checking the existence of a variable in the global context can be done by checking the
existence of a property on the _global object_, using the
{{jsxref("Operators/in", "in")}} operator, for instance:

```js
if ("x" in window) {
  //  these statements execute only if x is defined globally
}
```

### void operator and undefined

The {{jsxref("Operators/void", "void")}} operator is a third alternative.

```js
var x;
if (x === void 0) {
  //  these statements execute
}

//  y has not been declared before
if (y === void 0) {
  //  throws Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined
}
```
