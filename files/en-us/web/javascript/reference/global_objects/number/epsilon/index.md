{{JSRef}}

The **`Number.EPSILON`** static data property represents the difference between 1 and the smallest floating point number greater than 1.

## Value

2<sup>-52</sup>, or approximately `2.2204460492503130808472633361816E-16`.

## Description

`Number.EPSILON` is the difference between 1 and the next greater number representable in the Number format, because [double precision floating point format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_precision_floating-point_format) only has 52 bits to represent the [mantissa](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number#number_encoding), and the lowest bit has a significance of 2<sup>-52</sup>.

Note that the absolute accuracy of floating numbers decreases as the number gets larger, because the exponent grows while the mantissa's accuracy stays the same. {{jsxref("Number.MIN_VALUE")}} is the smallest representable positive number, which is much smaller than `Number.EPSILON`.

Because `EPSILON` is a static property of {{jsxref("Number")}}, you always use it as `Number.EPSILON`, rather than as a property of a number value.

## Examples

### Testing equality

Any number encoding system occupying a finite number of bits, of whatever base you choose (e.g. decimal or binary), will _necessarily_ be unable to represent all numbers exactly, because you are trying to represent an infinite number of points on the number line using a finite amount of memory. For example, a base-10 (decimal) system cannot represent 1/3 exactly, and a base-2 (binary) system cannot represent `0.1` exactly. Thus, for example, `0.1 + 0.2` is not exactly equal to `0.3`:

```js
console.log(0.1 + 0.2); // 0.30000000000000004
console.log(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3); // false
```

For this reason, it is often advised that **floating point numbers should never be compared with `===`**. Instead, we can deem two numbers as equal if they are _close enough_ to each other. The `Number.EPSILON` constant is usually a reasonable threshold for errors if the arithmetic is around the magnitude of `1`, because `EPSILON`, in essence, specifies how accurate the number "1" is.

```js
function equal(x, y) {
  return Math.abs(x - y) < Number.EPSILON;
}

const x = 0.2;
const y = 0.3;
const z = 0.1;
console.log(equal(x + z, y)); // true
```

However, `Number.EPSILON` is inappropriate for any arithmetic operating on a larger magnitude. If your data is on the 10<sup>3</sup> order of magnitude, the decimal part will have a much smaller accuracy than `Number.EPSILON`:

```js
function equal(x, y) {
  return Math.abs(x - y) < Number.EPSILON;
}

const x = 1000.1;
const y = 1000.2;
const z = 2000.3;
console.log(x + y); // 2000.3000000000002; error of 10^-13 instead of 10^-16
console.log(equal(x + y, z)); // false
```

In this case, a larger tolerance is required. As the numbers compared have a magnitude of approximately `2000`, a multiplier such as `2000 * Number.EPSILON` creates enough tolerance for this instance.

```js
function equal(x, y, tolerance = Number.EPSILON) {
  return Math.abs(x - y) < tolerance;
}

const x = 1000.1;
const y = 1000.2;
const z = 2000.3;
console.log(equal(x + y, z, 2000 * Number.EPSILON)); // true
```

In addition to magnitude, it is important to consider the _accuracy_ of your input. For example, if the numbers are collected from a form input and the input value can only be adjusted by steps of `0.1` (i.e. [`<input type="number" step="0.1">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/step)), it usually makes sense to allow a much larger tolerance, such as `0.01`, since the data only has a precision of `0.1`.

> **Note:** Important takeaway: do not simply use `Number.EPSILON` as a threshold for equality testing. Use a threshold that is appropriate for the magnitude and accuracy of the numbers you are comparing.
