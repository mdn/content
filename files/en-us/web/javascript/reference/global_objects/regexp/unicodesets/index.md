{{JSRef}}

The **`unicodeSets`** accessor property of {{jsxref("RegExp")}} instances returns whether or not the `v` flag is used with this regular expression.

## Description

`RegExp.prototype.unicodeSets` has the value `true` if the `v` flag was used; otherwise, `false`. The `v` flag is an "upgrade" to the [`u`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/unicode) flag that enables more Unicode-related features. ("v" is the next letter after "u" in the alphabet.) Because `u` and `v` interpret the same regex in incompatible ways, using both flags results in a {{jsxref("SyntaxError")}}. With the `v` flag, you get all features mentioned in the `u` flag description, plus:

- The [`\p`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Unicode_character_class_escape) escape sequence can be additionally used to match properties of strings, instead of just characters.
- The [character class](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Character_class) syntax is upgraded to allow intersection, union, and subtraction syntaxes, as well as matching multiple Unicode characters.
- The character class complement syntax `[^...]` constructs a complement class instead of negating the match result, avoiding some confusing behaviors with case-insensitive matching. For more information, see [Complement classes and case-insensitive matching](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Character_class#complement_classes_and_case-insensitive_matching).

Some valid `u`-mode regexes become invalid in `v`-mode. Specifically, the character class syntax is different:

- In addition to `]` and `\`, the following characters must be escaped in character classes if they represent literal characters: `(`, `)`, `[`, `{`, `}`, `/`, `-`, `|`. This list is somewhat similar to the list of [syntax characters](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Literal_character), except that `^`, `$`, `*`, `+`, and `?` are not reserved inside character classes, while `/` and `-` are not reserved outside character classes (although `/` may delimit a regex literal and therefore still needs to be escaped). All these characters may also be optionally escaped in `u`-mode character classes.
- The following "double punctuator" sequences must be escaped in character classes (but they don't make much sense without the `v` flag anyway): `&&`, `!!`, `##`, `$$`, `%%`, `**`, `++`, `,,`, `..`, `::`, `;;`, `<<`, `==`, `>>`, `??`, `@@`, `^^`, ` `` `, `~~`. In `u` mode, some of these characters can only appear literally within character classes and cause a syntax error when escaped. In `v` mode, they must be escaped when appearing in pairs, but can be optionally escaped when appearing alone. For example, `/[\!]/u` is invalid because it's an [identity escape](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Character_escape), but both `/[\!]/v` and `/[!]/v` are valid, while `/[!!]/v` is invalid. The [literal character](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Literal_character) reference has a detailed table of which characters can appear escaped or unescaped.

> **Note:** The `v` mode does not interpret grapheme clusters as single characters; they are still multiple code points. For example, `/[ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡³]/v` is still able to match `"ðŸ‡º"`.

The set accessor of `unicodeSets` is `undefined`. You cannot change this property directly.

## Examples

### Using the unicodeSets property

```js
const regex = /[\p{Script_Extensions=Greek}&&\p{Letter}]/v;

console.log(regex.unicodeSets); // true
```
