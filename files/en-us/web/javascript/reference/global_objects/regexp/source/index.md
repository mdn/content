{{JSRef}}

The **`source`** accessor property is a string containing the source text of the regex object, without the two forward slashes on both sides or any flags.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/regexp-prototype-source.html")}}

## Description

Conceptually, the `source` property is the text between the two forward slashes in the regular expression literal. The language requires the returned string to be properly escaped, so that when the `source` is concatenated with a forward slash on both ends, it would form a parsable regex literal. For example, for `new RegExp("/")`, the `source` is `\\/`, because if it generates `/`, the resulting literal becomes `///`, which is a line comment. Similarly, all [line terminators](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#line_terminators) will be escaped because line terminator _characters_ would break up the regex literal. There's no requirement for other characters, as long as the result is parsable. For empty regular expressions, the string `(?:)` is returned.

## Examples

### Using source

```js
const regex = /fooBar/gi;

console.log(regex.source); // "fooBar", doesn't contain /.../ and "gi".
```

### Empty regular expressions and escaping

```js
new RegExp().source; // "(?:)"

new RegExp("\n").source === "\\n"; // true, starting with ES5
```
