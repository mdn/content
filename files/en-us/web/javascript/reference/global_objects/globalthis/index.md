{{jsSidebar("Objects")}}

The global **`globalThis`** property contains the global `this` value, which is akin to the [global object](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Global_object).

## Description

Historically, accessing the global object has required different syntax in different JavaScript environments. On the web you can use {{domxref("Window.window", "window")}}, {{domxref("Window.self", "self")}}, or {{domxref("Window.frames", "frames")}} - but in [Web Workers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Worker) only `self` will work. In Node.js none of these work, and you must instead use `global`.
The `this` keyword could be used inside functions running in non–strict mode, but `this` will be `undefined` in Modules and inside functions running in strict mode. You can also use `Function('return this')()`, but environments that disable {{jsxref("Global_Objects/eval", "eval()")}}, like {{Glossary("CSP")}} in browsers, prevent use of {{jsxref("Function")}} in this way.

The `globalThis` property provides a standard way of accessing the global `this` value (and hence the global object itself) across environments. Unlike similar properties such as `window` and `self`, it's guaranteed to work in window and non-window contexts. In this way, you can access the global object in a consistent manner without having to know which environment the code is being run in. To help you remember the name, just remember that in global scope the `this` value is `globalThis`.

### HTML and the WindowProxy

In many engines `globalThis` will be a reference to the actual global object, but in web browsers, due to iframe and cross-window security considerations, it references a {{jsxref("Proxy")}} around the actual global object (which you can't directly access). This distinction is rarely relevant in common usage, but important to be aware of.

### Naming

Several other popular name choices such as `self` and `global` were removed from consideration because of their potential to break compatibility with existing code. See the [language proposal's "naming" document](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-global/blob/master/NAMING.md) for more details.

## Examples

### Search for the global across environments

Prior to `globalThis`, the only reliable cross-platform way to get the global object for an environment was `Function('return this')()`. However, this causes [CSP](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) violations in some settings, so [es6-shim](https://github.com/paulmillr/es6-shim) uses a check like this, for example:

```js
var getGlobal = function () {
  if (typeof self !== "undefined") {
    return self;
  }
  if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
    return window;
  }
  if (typeof global !== "undefined") {
    return global;
  }
  throw new Error("unable to locate global object");
};

var globals = getGlobal();

if (typeof globals.setTimeout !== "function") {
  // no setTimeout in this environment!
}
```

With `globalThis` available, the additional search for the global across environments is not necessary anymore:

```js
if (typeof globalThis.setTimeout !== "function") {
  // no setTimeout in this environment!
}
```
