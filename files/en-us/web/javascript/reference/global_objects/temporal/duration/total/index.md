{{JSRef}}{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`total()`** method of {{jsxref("Temporal.Duration")}} instances returns a number representing the total duration in the given unit.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
total(unit)
total(options)
```

### Parameters

- `unit`
  - : A string representing the [`unit`](#unit_2) option. This is a convenience overload, so `total(unit)` is equivalent to `total({ unit })`, where `unit` is a string.
- `options`
  - : An object containing some or all of the following properties (in the order they are retrieved and validated):
    - `relativeTo` {{optional_inline}}
      - : A zoned or plain date(time) that provides the time and calendar information to resolve [calendar durations](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Temporal/Duration#calendar_durations) (see the link for the general interpretation of this option). Required if either `this` or `other` is a calendar duration, or `unit` is a calendar unit.
    - `unit`
      - : Any of the temporal units: `"year"`, `"month"`, `"week"`, `"day"`, `"hour"`, `"minute"`, `"second"`, `"millisecond"`, `"microsecond"`, `"nanosecond"`, or their plural forms.

### Return value

A floating-point number representing the total duration in the given unit. May be inexact due to floating point precision limits.

### Exceptions

- {{jsxref("RangeError")}}
  - : Thrown in one of the following cases:
    - `unit` is not provided or is not a valid unit.
    - Either `this` or `other` is a calendar duration, or `unit` is a calendar unit, and `relativeTo` is not provided.

## Description

If a `relativeTo` is provided, the result is calculated by adding the duration to the starting point, finding the difference between the result and the starting point (in nanoseconds), and then converting the difference to the requested unit by dividing by the appropriate number of nanoseconds per unit. Providing a zoned date-time allows daylight saving time and other time zone changes to be taken into account too; otherwise, 24-hour days are assumed.

If `relativeTo` is not provided, the result is calculated by converting the duration to nanoseconds and dividing by the appropriate number of nanoseconds per unit.

## Examples

### Using total()

```js
const d = Temporal.Duration.from({ hours: 1, minutes: 30 });

console.log(d.total("minutes")); // 90
console.log(d.total("hours")); // 1.5
```

### Total of a calendar duration

```js
const d = Temporal.Duration.from({ months: 1 });

console.log(
  d.total({ unit: "days", relativeTo: Temporal.PlainDate.from("2021-01-01") }),
); // 31
```
