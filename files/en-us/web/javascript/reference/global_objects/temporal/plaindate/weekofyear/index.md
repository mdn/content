{{JSRef}}

The **`weekOfYear`** accessor property of {{jsxref("Temporal.PlainDate")}} instances returns a positive integer representing the 1-based week index in the {{jsxref("Temporal/PlainDate/yearOfWeek", "yearOfWeek")}} of this date, or `undefined` if the calendar does not have a well-defined week system. The first week of the year is `1`, and the last week is the {{jsxref("Temporal/PlainDate/weeksInYear", "weeksInYear")}}. Note that for ISO 8601, the first and last few days of the year may be attributed to the last week of the previous year or the first week of the next year.
