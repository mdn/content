{{JSRef}}

The **`inLeapYear`** accessor property of {{jsxref("Temporal.PlainDate")}} instances returns a boolean indicating whether this date is in a leap year. A leap year is a year that has more days (a leap day or leap month) than a common year. For the ISO 8601 calendar, a leap year is a year that is evenly divisible by 4, except for years that are evenly divisible by 100, unless the year is also evenly divisible by 400.
