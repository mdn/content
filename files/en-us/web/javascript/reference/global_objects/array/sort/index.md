{{JSRef}}

The **`sort()`** method sorts the elements of an array _[in place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)_ and returns the reference to the same array, now sorted. The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values.

The time and space complexity of the sort cannot be guaranteed as it depends on the
implementation.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
sort()
sort(compareFn)
```

### Parameters

- `compareFn` {{optional_inline}}
  - : A function that defines the sort order. The return value should be a number whose positivity indicates the relative order of the two elements. The function is called with the following arguments:

    - `a`
      - : The first element for comparison. Will never be `undefined`.
    - `b`
      - : The second element for comparison. Will never be `undefined`.

    If omitted, the array elements are converted to strings, then sorted according to each character's Unicode code point value.

### Return value

The reference to the original array, now sorted. Note that the array is sorted _[in place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)_, and no copy is made.

## Description

If `compareFn` is not supplied, all non-`undefined` array
elements are sorted by converting them to strings and comparing strings in UTF-16 code
units order. For example, "banana" comes before "cherry". In a numeric sort, 9 comes
before 80, but because numbers are converted to strings, "80" comes before "9" in the
Unicode order. All `undefined` elements are sorted to the end of the array.

The `sort()` method preserves empty slots. If the source array is [sparse](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Indexed_collections#sparse_arrays), the empty slots are moved to the end of the array, and always come after all the `undefined`.

> **Note:** In UTF-16, Unicode characters above `\uFFFF` are
> encoded as two surrogate code units, of the range
> `\uD800` - `\uDFFF`. The value of each code unit is taken
> separately into account for the comparison. Thus the character formed by the surrogate
> pair `\uD855\uDE51` will be sorted before the character
> `\uFF3A`.

If `compareFn` is supplied, all non-`undefined` array
elements are sorted according to the return value of the compare function (all
`undefined` elements are sorted to the end of the array, with no call to
`compareFn`).

| `compareFn(a, b)` return value | sort order                         |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| > 0                            | sort `a` after `b`, e.g. `[b, a]`  |
| < 0                            | sort `a` before `b`, e.g. `[a, b]` |
| === 0                          | keep original order of `a` and `b` |

So, the compare function has the following form:

```js
function compareFn(a, b) {
  if (a is less than b by some ordering criterion) {
    return -1;
  }
  if (a is greater than b by the ordering criterion) {
    return 1;
  }
  // a must be equal to b
  return 0;
}
```

More formally, the comparator is expected to have the following properties, in order to ensure proper sort behavior:

- _Pure_: The comparator does not mutate the objects being compared or any external state. (This is important because there's no guarantee _when_ and _how_ the comparator will be called, so any particular call should not produce visible effects to the outside.)
- _Stable_: The comparator returns the same result with the same pair of input.
- _Reflexive_: `compareFn(a, a) === 0`.
- _Anti-symmetric_: `compareFn(a, b)` and `compareFn(b, a)` must both be `0` or have opposite signs.
- _Transitive_: If `compareFn(a, b)` and `compareFn(b, c)` are both positive, zero, or negative, then `compareFn(a, c)` has the same positivity as the previous two.

A comparator conforming to the constraints above will always be able to return all of `1`, `0`, and `-1`, or consistently return `0`. For example, if a comparator only returns `1` and `0`, or only returns `0` and `-1`, it will not be able to sort reliably because _anti-symmetry_ is broken. A comparator that always returns `0` will cause the array to not be changed at all, but is reliable nonetheless.

The default lexicographic comparator satisfies all constraints above.

To compare numbers instead of strings, the compare function can subtract `b`
from `a`. The following function will sort the array in ascending order (if
it doesn't contain `Infinity` and `NaN`):

```js
function compareNumbers(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}
```

The `sort()` method is [generic](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#generic_array_methods). It only expects the `this` value to have a `length` property and integer-keyed properties. Although strings are also array-like, this method is not suitable to be applied on them, as strings are immutable.

## Examples

### Creating, displaying, and sorting an array

The following example creates four arrays and displays the original array, then the
sorted arrays. The numeric arrays are sorted without a compare function, then sorted
using one.

```js
const stringArray = ["Blue", "Humpback", "Beluga"];
const numberArray = [40, 1, 5, 200];
const numericStringArray = ["80", "9", "700"];
const mixedNumericArray = ["80", "9", "700", 40, 1, 5, 200];

function compareNumbers(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}

stringArray.join(); // 'Blue,Humpback,Beluga'
stringArray.sort(); // ['Beluga', 'Blue', 'Humpback']

numberArray.join(); // '40,1,5,200'
numberArray.sort(); // [1, 200, 40, 5]
numberArray.sort(compareNumbers); // [1, 5, 40, 200]

numericStringArray.join(); // '80,9,700'
numericStringArray.sort(); // ['700', '80', '9']
numericStringArray.sort(compareNumbers); // ['9', '80', '700']

mixedNumericArray.join(); // '80,9,700,40,1,5,200'
mixedNumericArray.sort(); // [1, 200, 40, 5, '700', '80', '9']
mixedNumericArray.sort(compareNumbers); // [1, 5, '9', 40, '80', 200, '700']
```

### Sorting array of objects

Arrays of objects can be sorted by comparing the value of one of their properties.

```js
const items = [
  { name: "Edward", value: 21 },
  { name: "Sharpe", value: 37 },
  { name: "And", value: 45 },
  { name: "The", value: -12 },
  { name: "Magnetic", value: 13 },
  { name: "Zeros", value: 37 },
];

// sort by value
items.sort((a, b) => a.value - b.value);

// sort by name
items.sort((a, b) => {
  const nameA = a.name.toUpperCase(); // ignore upper and lowercase
  const nameB = b.name.toUpperCase(); // ignore upper and lowercase
  if (nameA < nameB) {
    return -1;
  }
  if (nameA > nameB) {
    return 1;
  }

  // names must be equal
  return 0;
});
```

### Sorting non-ASCII characters

For sorting strings with non-ASCII characters, i.e. strings with accented characters
(e, é, è, a, ä, etc.), strings from languages other than English, use
{{jsxref("String.prototype.localeCompare()")}}. This function can compare those characters so they
appear in the right order.

```js
const items = ["réservé", "premier", "communiqué", "café", "adieu", "éclair"];
items.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b));

// items is ['adieu', 'café', 'communiqué', 'éclair', 'premier', 'réservé']
```

### Sorting with map

The `compareFn` can be invoked multiple times per element within the
array. Depending on the `compareFn`'s nature, this may yield a high
overhead. The more work a `compareFn` does and the more elements there
are to sort, it may be more efficient to use [`map()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map) for
sorting. The idea is to traverse the array once to extract the actual values used for
sorting into a temporary array, sort the temporary array, and then traverse the
temporary array to achieve the right order.

```js
// the array to be sorted
const data = ["delta", "alpha", "charlie", "bravo"];

// temporary array holds objects with position and sort-value
const mapped = data.map((v, i) => {
  return { i, value: someSlowOperation(v) };
});

// sorting the mapped array containing the reduced values
mapped.sort((a, b) => {
  if (a.value > b.value) {
    return 1;
  }
  if (a.value < b.value) {
    return -1;
  }
  return 0;
});

const result = mapped.map((v) => data[v.i]);
```

There is an open source library available called [mapsort](https://github.com/Pimm/mapsort) which applies this approach.

### sort() returns the reference to the same array

The `sort()` method returns a reference to the original array, so mutating the returned array will mutate the original array as well.

```js
const numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5];
const sorted = numbers.sort((a, b) => a - b);
// numbers and sorted are both [1, 1, 3, 4, 5]
sorted[0] = 10;
console.log(numbers[0]); // 10
```

In case you want `sort()` to not mutate the original array, but return a [shallow-copied](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Shallow_copy) array like other array methods (e.g. [`map()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)) do, you can do a shallow copy before calling `sort()`, using the [spread syntax](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) or [`Array.from()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/from).

```js
const numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5];
// [...numbers] creates a shallow copy, so sort() does not mutate the original
const sorted = [...numbers].sort((a, b) => a - b);
sorted[0] = 10;
console.log(numbers[0]); // 3
```

### Sort stability

Since version 10 (or ECMAScript 2019), the [specification](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-array.prototype.sort) dictates that `Array.prototype.sort` is stable.

For example, say you had a list of students alongside their grades. Note that the list of students is already pre-sorted by name in alphabetical order:

```js
const students = [
  { name: "Alex", grade: 15 },
  { name: "Devlin", grade: 15 },
  { name: "Eagle", grade: 13 },
  { name: "Sam", grade: 14 },
];
```

After sorting this array by `grade` in ascending order:

```js
students.sort((firstItem, secondItem) => firstItem.grade - secondItem.grade);
```

The `students` variable will then have the following value:

```js
[
  { name: "Eagle", grade: 13 },
  { name: "Sam", grade: 14 },
  { name: "Alex", grade: 15 }, // original maintained for similar grade (stable sorting)
  { name: "Devlin", grade: 15 }, // original maintained for similar grade (stable sorting)
];
```

It's important to note that students that have the same grade (for example, Alex and Devlin), will remain in the same order as before calling the sort. This is what a stable sorting algorithm guarantees.

Before version 10 (or ECMAScript 2019), sort stability was not guaranteed, meaning that you could end up with the following:

```js
[
  { name: "Eagle", grade: 13 },
  { name: "Sam", grade: 14 },
  { name: "Devlin", grade: 15 }, // original order not maintained
  { name: "Alex", grade: 15 }, // original order not maintained
];
```

### Sorting with non-well-formed comparator

If a comparing function does not satisfy all of purity, stability, reflexivity, anti-symmetry, and transitivity rules, as explained in the [description](#description), the program's behavior is not well-defined.

For example, consider this code:

```js
const arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9];
const compareFn = (a, b) => (a > b ? 1 : 0);
arr.sort(compareFn);
```

The `compareFn` function here is not well-formed, because it does not satisfy anti-symmetry: if `a > b`, it returns `1`; but by swapping `a` and `b`, it returns `0` instead of a negative value. Therefore, the resulting array will be different across engines. For example, V8 (used by Chrome, Node.js, etc.) and JavaScriptCore (used by Safari) would not sort the array at all and return `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]`, while SpiderMonkey (used by Firefox) will return the array sorted ascendingly, as `[1, 1, 3, 4, 5, 9]`.

However, if the `compareFn` function is changed slightly so that it returns `-1` or `0`:

```js
const arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9];
const compareFn = (a, b) => (a > b ? -1 : 0);
arr.sort(compareFn);
```

Then V8 and JavaScriptCore sorts it descendingly, as `[9, 5, 4, 3, 1, 1]`, while SpiderMonkey returns it as-is: `[3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]`.

Due to this implementation inconsistency, you are always advised to make your comparator well-formed by following the five constraints.

### Using sort() on sparse arrays

Empty slots are moved to the end of the array.

```js
console.log(["a", "c", , "b"].sort()); // ['a', 'b', 'c', empty]
console.log([, undefined, "a", "b"].sort()); // ["a", "b", undefined, empty]
```

### Calling sort() on non-array objects

The `sort()` method reads the `length` property of `this`. It then collects all existing integer-keyed properties in the range of `0` to `length - 1`, sorts them, and writes them back. If there are missing properties in the range, the corresponding trailing properties are [deleted](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete), as if the non-existent properties are sorted towards the end.

```js
const arrayLike = {
  length: 3,
  unrelated: "foo",
  0: 5,
  2: 4,
};
console.log(Array.prototype.sort.call(arrayLike));
// { '0': 4, '1': 5, length: 3, unrelated: 'foo' }
```
