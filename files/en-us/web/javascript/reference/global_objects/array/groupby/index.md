{{JSRef}}

The **`groupBy()`** method groups the elements of the calling array according to the values returned by a provided testing function.
The returned object has separate properties for each group, containing arrays with the elements in the group.

<!-- {{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/array-groupby.html")}} -->

Note that the returned object references the _same_ elements as the original array (not {{glossary("deep copy","deep copies")}}).
Changing the internal structure of these elements will be reflected in both the original array and the returned object.

This method can be used when group names can be represented by strings.
If you need to group elements using a key that is some arbitrary object, use {{jsxref("Array.prototype.groupByToMap()")}} instead.

## Syntax

```js
// Arrow function
groupBy((element) => { /* ... */ } )
groupBy((element, index) => { /* ... */ } )
groupBy((element, index, array) => { /* ... */ } )

// Callback function
groupBy(callbackFn)
groupBy(callbackFn, thisArg)

// Inline callback function
groupBy(function(element) { /* ... */ })
groupBy(function(element, index) { /* ... */ })
groupBy(function(element, index, array){ /* ... */ })
groupBy(function(element, index, array) { /* ... */ }, thisArg)
```

### Parameters

- `callbackFn`

  - : Function to execute on each element in the array, taking 3 arguments:

    - `element`
      - : The value of the current element in the array.
    - `index` {{optional_inline}}
      - : The index (position) of the current element in the array.
    - `array` {{optional_inline}}
      - : The array that `groupBy()` was called on.

    The object returned from the callback indicates the group of the current element.
    It must be possible to coerce this returned callback value into a string (which will then be used as a property name in the final returned object).

- `thisArg` {{optional_inline}}
  - : Object to use as {{jsxref("Operators/this", "this")}} inside `callbackFn`.
      If not specified, `undefined` will be used.

### Return value

An [`Object`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) with properties for all groups, each assigned to an array containing the elements of the associated group.
The value is an object that does not inherit from `Object.prototype`.

### Exceptions

- `TypeError`
  - : The specified callback function is not callable.

## Description

The `groupBy()` method executes the `callbackFn` function once for each index of the array, returning a string (or value that can be coerced to a string) indicating the group of the element.
A new property and array is created in the result object for each unique group name that is returned by the callback.
Each element is added to the array in the property that corresponds to its group.

`callbackFn` is invoked for _every_ index of the array, not just those with assigned values.
This means it may be less efficient for sparse arrays, compared to methods that only visit assigned values.

If a `thisArg` parameter is provided to `groupBy()`, it will be used as the `this` value inside each invocation of the `callbackFn`.
If it is not provided, then {{jsxref("undefined")}} is used.

The `groupBy()` method does not mutate the array on which it is called, but the function provided to `callbackFn` can.
Note however that the elements processed by `groupBy()` are set _before_ the first invocation of `callbackFn`.
Therefore:

- `callbackFn` will not visit any elements added to the array after the call to `groupBy()` begins.
- Elements that are assigned to indexes already visited, or to indexes outside the range, will not be visited by `callbackFn`.
- If an existing, yet-unvisited element of the array is changed by `callbackFn`, its value passed to the `callbackFn` will be the value at the time `groupBy()` visits that element's index.
- Elements that are {{jsxref("Operators/delete", "deleted")}} are still visited.

> **Warning:** Concurrent modifications of the kind described above frequently lead to hard-to-understand code and are generally to be avoided (except in special cases).

## Examples

First we define an array containing objects representing an inventory of different foodstuffs.
Each food has a `type`, which might need to be stored differently, and a `quantity` that can be used to determine when we need to reorder each item.

```js
const inventory = [
  {name: 'apples', type: 'vegetables', quantity: 5},
  {name: 'bananas',  type: 'fruit', quantity: 0},
  {name: 'goat', type: 'meat', quantity: 23},
  {name: 'cherries', type: 'fruit', quantity: 5},
  {name: 'fish', type: 'meat', quantity: 22}
];
```

The code below groups the elements by the value of their `type` property.

```js
let result = inventory.groupBy( ({ type }) => type );

/* Result is:
{ 
  vegetables: [ 
    { name: "apples", type: "vegetables", quantity: 5 } 
  ],
  fruit: [
    { name: "bananas", type: "fruit", quantity: 0 },
    { name: "cherries", type: "fruit", quantity: 5 }
  ], 
  meat: [
    { name: "goat", type: "meat", quantity: 23 },
    { name: "fish", type: "meat", quantity: 22 }
  ] 
}
*/
```

The arrow function just returns the `type` of each array element each time it is called.
Note that the function argument `{ type }` is a basic example of [object destructuring syntax for function arguments](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#unpacking_fields_from_objects_passed_as_a_function_parameter).
This unpacks the `type` property of an object passed as a parameter, and assigns it to a variable named `type` in the body of the function.
This is a very succinct way to access the relevant values of elements within a function.

We can also create groups inferred from values in one or more properties of the elements.
Below is a very similar example that uses a callback function and the `quantity` field to define that an element is in the `ok` or `reorder` groups.

```js
function myCallback( { quantity } ) {
  return quantity > 5 ? 'ok' : 'reorder';
}

result = inventory.groupBy( myCallback );

/* Result is:
{ 
  reorder: [
    { name: "apples", type: "vegetables", quantity: 5 },
    { name: "bananas", type: "fruit", quantity: 0 },
    { name: "cherries", type: "fruit", quantity: 5 }
  ], 
  ok: [
    { name: "goat", type: "meat", quantity: 23 },
    { name: "fish", type: "meat", quantity: 22 }
  ] 
}
*/
```

The callback syntax provides access to the array and current index, so it is possible to implement grouping strategies based on th values of other elements in the array.
