The **`includes()`** method determines whether an array
includes a certain value among its entries, returning `true` or
`false` as appropriate.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/array-includes.html")}}

## Syntax

```js
includes(searchElement)
includes(searchElement, fromIndex)
```

### Parameters

- `searchElement`

  - : The value to search for.

    > **Note:** When comparing strings and characters,
    > `includes()` is _case-sensitive_.

- `fromIndex` {{optional_inline}}

  - : The position in this array at which to begin searching for
    `searchElement`.

    The first element to be searched is found at `fromIndex` for
    positive values of `fromIndex`, or at
    `arr.length + fromIndex` for negative values of
    `fromIndex` (using the {{interwiki("wikipedia", "absolute
    value")}} of `fromIndex` as the number of elementsÂ from the end
    of the array at which to start the search).

    Defaults to `0`.

### Return value

A {{jsxref("Boolean")}} which is `true` if the value
`searchElement` is found within the array (or the part of the array
indicated by the index `fromIndex`, if specified).

Values of zero are all considered to be equal, regardless of sign. (That is,
`-0` is considered to be equal to both `0` and `+0`),
but `false` is _not_ considered to be the same as `0`.

> **Note:** Technically speaking, `includes()` uses the
> [`sameValueZero`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness#Same-value-zero_equality)
> algorithm to determine whether the given element is found.

## Examples

```js
[1, 2, 3].includes(2)         // true
[1, 2, 3].includes(4)         // false
[1, 2, 3].includes(3, 3)      // false
[1, 2, 3].includes(3, -1)     // true
[1, 2, NaN].includes(NaN)     // true
["1", "2", "3"].includes(3)   // false
```

### `fromIndex` is greater than or equal to the array length

If `fromIndex` is greater than or equal to the length of the
array, `false` is returned. The array will not be searched.

```js
let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']

arr.includes('c', 3)    // false
arr.includes('c', 100)  // false
```

### Computed index is less than 0

If `fromIndex` is negative, the computed index is calculated to
be used as a position in the array at which to begin searching for
`searchElement`. If the computed index is less than or equal to
`0`, the entire array will be searched.

```js
// array length is 3
// fromIndex is -100
// computed index is 3 + (-100) = -97

let arr = ['a', 'b', 'c']

arr.includes('a', -100) // true
arr.includes('b', -100) // true
arr.includes('c', -100) // true
arr.includes('a', -2)   // false
```

### includes() used as a generic method

`includes()` method is intentionally generic. It does not require
`this` value to be an Array object, so it can be applied to other kinds of
objects (e.g. array-like objects).

The example below illustrates `includes()` method called on the function's
[arguments](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments) object.

```js
(function() {
  console.log(Array.prototype.includes.call(arguments, 'a'))  // true
  console.log(Array.prototype.includes.call(arguments, 'd'))  // false
})('a','b','c') 
```
