{{JSRef}}

The **`includes()`** method determines whether an array
includes a certain value among its entries, returning `true` or
`false` as appropriate.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/array-includes.html")}}

## Syntax

```js-nolint
includes(searchElement)
includes(searchElement, fromIndex)
```

### Parameters

- `searchElement`
  - : The value to search for.
- `fromIndex` {{optional_inline}}
  - : Zero-based index at which to start searching, [converted to an integer](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number#integer_conversion).
    - Negative index counts back from the end of the array â€” if `fromIndex < 0`, `fromIndex + array.length` is used. However, the array is still searched from front to back in this case.
    - If `fromIndex < -array.length` or `fromIndex` is omitted, `0` is used, causing the entire array to be searched.
    - If `fromIndex >= array.length`, the array is not searched and `false` is returned.

### Return value

A boolean value which is `true` if the value `searchElement` is found within the array (or the part of the array indicated by the index `fromIndex`, if specified).

## Description

The `includes()` method compares `searchElement` to elements of the array using the [SameValueZero](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Strict_equality) algorithm. Values of zero are all considered to be equal, regardless of sign. (That is, `-0` is equal to `0`), but `false` is _not_ considered to be the same as `0`. [`NaN`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN) can be correctly searched for.

When used on [sparse arrays](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Indexed_collections#sparse_arrays), the `includes()` method iterates empty slots as if they have the value `undefined`.

The `includes()` method is [generic](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#generic_array_methods). It only expects the `this` value to have a `length` property and integer-keyed properties.

## Examples

### Using includes()

```js
[1, 2, 3].includes(2); // true
[1, 2, 3].includes(4); // false
[1, 2, 3].includes(3, 3); // false
[1, 2, 3].includes(3, -1); // true
[1, 2, NaN].includes(NaN); // true
["1", "2", "3"].includes(3); // false
```

### fromIndex is greater than or equal to the array length

If `fromIndex` is greater than or equal to the length of the
array, `false` is returned. The array will not be searched.

```js
const arr = ["a", "b", "c"];

arr.includes("c", 3); // false
arr.includes("c", 100); // false
```

### Computed index is less than 0

If `fromIndex` is negative, the computed index is calculated to
be used as a position in the array at which to begin searching for
`searchElement`. If the computed index is less than or equal to
`0`, the entire array will be searched.

```js
// array length is 3
// fromIndex is -100
// computed index is 3 + (-100) = -97

const arr = ["a", "b", "c"];

arr.includes("a", -100); // true
arr.includes("b", -100); // true
arr.includes("c", -100); // true
arr.includes("a", -2); // false
```

### Using includes() on sparse arrays

You can search for `undefined` in a sparse array and get `true`.

```js
console.log([1, , 3].includes(undefined)); // true
```

### Calling includes() on non-array objects

The `includes()` method reads the `length` property of `this` and then accesses each integer index.

```js
const arrayLike = {
  length: 3,
  0: 2,
  1: 3,
  2: 4,
};
console.log(Array.prototype.includes.call(arrayLike, 2));
// true
console.log(Array.prototype.includes.call(arrayLike, 1));
// false
```
