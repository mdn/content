The static **`String.fromCharCode()`** method returns a string
created from the specified sequence of UTF-16 code units.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/string-fromcharcode.html","shorter")}}

## Syntax

```js
String.fromCharCode(num1)
String.fromCharCode(num1, num2)
String.fromCharCode(num1, num2, ..., numN)
```

### Parameters

- `num1, ..., numN`
  - : A sequence of numbers that are UTF-16 code units. The range is between
    `0` and `65535` (`0xFFFF`). Numbers greater than
    `0xFFFF` are truncated. No validity checks are performed.

### Return value

A string of length `N` consisting of the
`N` specified UTF-16 code units.

## Description

This method returns a string and not a {{jsxref("String")}} object.

Because `fromCharCode()` is a static method of {{jsxref("String")}}, you
always use it as `String.fromCharCode()`, rather than as a method of a
{{jsxref("String")}} object you created.

### Returning supplementary characters

In UTF-16, the most common characters can be represented by a single 16-bit value (i.e.
a code unit). However, this set of characters, known as the Base Multilingual Plane
(BMP), is only 1/17th of the total addressable Unicode
code points. The remaining code points, in the range of `65536`
(`0x010000`) to `1114111` (`0x10FFFF`) are known as
supplementary characters. In UTF-16, supplementary characters are represented by two
16-bit code units, known as surrogates, that were reserved for this purpose. A valid
combination of two surrogates used to represent a supplementary character is known as a
surrogate pair.

Because `fromCharCode()` only works with 16-bit values (same as the
`\u` escape sequence), a surrogate pair is required in order to return a
supplementary character. For example, both
`String.fromCharCode(0xD83C, 0xDF03)` and `\uD83C\uDF03` return
code point `U+1F303` "Night with Stars".

While there is a mathematical relationship between the supplementary code point value
(e.g. `0x1F303`) and both surrogate values that represent it
(e.g., `0xD83C` and `0xDF03`), it does require an extra step to
either calculate or look up the surrogate pair values every time a supplementary code
point is to be used. For this reason, it's more convenient to use
{{jsxref("String.fromCodePoint()")}} (part of the ES2015 standard), which allows for
returning supplementary characters based on their actual code point value. For example,
`String.fromCodePoint(0x1F303)` returns code point `U+1F303`
"Night with Stars".

## Examples

### Using fromCharCode()

BMP characters, in UTF-16, use a single code unit:

```js
String.fromCharCode(65, 66, 67);   // returns "ABC"
String.fromCharCode(0x2014);       // returns "—"
String.fromCharCode(0x12014);      // also returns "—"; the digit 1 is truncated and ignored
String.fromCharCode(8212);         // also returns "—"; 8212 is the decimal form of 0x2014
```

Supplementary characters, in UTF-16, require two code units (i.e. a surrogate pair):

```js
String.fromCharCode(0xD83C, 0xDF03); // Code Point U+1F303 "Night with
String.fromCharCode(55356, 57091);   // Stars" == "\uD83C\uDF03"

String.fromCharCode(0xD834, 0xDF06, 0x61, 0xD834, 0xDF07); // "\uD834\uDF06a\uD834\uDF07"
```
