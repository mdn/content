{{JSRef}}

The **`split()`** method divides a
{{jsxref("String")}} into an ordered list of substrings, puts these substrings into an
array, and returns the array.  The division is done by searching for a pattern; where
the pattern is provided as the first parameter in the method's call.

## Syntax

```js
split()
split(separator)
split(separator, limit)
```

### Parameters

- `separator` {{optional_inline}}

  - : The pattern describing where each split should occur.
     The `separator` can be a simple string or it can be a
    {{jsxref("Global_Objects/RegExp", "regular expression", "", 1)}}.

    - The simplest case is when `separator` is just a single
      character; this is used to split a delimited string.  For example, a string
      containing tab separated values (TSV) could be parsed by passing a tab character
      as the separator, like this: `myString.split("\t")`.
    - If `separator` contains multiple characters, that entire
      character sequence must be found in order to split.
    - If `separator` is omitted or does not occur in
      `str`, the returned array contains one element consisting of
      the entire string.
    - If `separator` appears at the beginning (or end) of the
      string, it still has the effect of splitting.  The result is an empty (i.e. zero
      length) string, which appears at the first (or last) position of the returned
      array.
    - If `separator` is an empty string (`""`),
      `str` is converted to an array of each of its UTF-16
      "characters".

    > **Warning:** When the empty string (`""`) is used as a
    > separator, the string is **not** split by _user-perceived
    > characters_ ([grapheme
    > clusters](https://unicode.org/reports/tr29/#Grapheme_Cluster_Boundaries)) or unicode characters (codepoints), but by UTF-16 codeunits. This
    > destroys [surrogate
    > pairs](https://unicode.org/faq/utf_bom.html#utf16-2). See [“How do you get a
    > string to a character array in JavaScript?” on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34717402).

- `limit` {{optional_inline}}

  - : A non-negative integer specifying a limit on the number of substrings to be
    included in the array. If provided, splits the string at each occurrence of the
    specified `separator`, but stops when
    `limit` entries have been placed in the array. Any leftover
    text is not included in the array at all.

    - The array may contain fewer entries than `limit` if the end of the
      string is reached before the limit is reached.
    - If `limit` is `0`, `[]` is returned.

### Return value

An {{jsxref("Array")}} of strings, split at each point where the
`separator` occurs in the given string.

## Description

When found, `separator` is removed from the string, and the
substrings are returned in an array.

If `separator` is a regular expression with capturing
parentheses, then each time `separator` matches, the results
(including any `undefined` results) of the capturing parentheses are spliced
into the output array.

If the separator is an array, then that Array is coerced to a String and used as a
separator.

## Examples

### Using `split()`

When the string is empty, `split()` returns an array containing one empty
string, rather than an empty array. If the string and separator are both empty
strings, an empty array is returned.

```js
const myString = ''
const splits = myString.split()

console.log(splits)

// ↪ [""]
```

The following example defines a function that splits a string into an array of strings
using `separator`. After splitting the string, the function logs
messages indicating the original string (before the split), the separator used, the
number of elements in the array, and the individual array elements.

```js
function splitString(stringToSplit, separator) {
  const arrayOfStrings = stringToSplit.split(separator)

  console.log('The original string is: ', stringToSplit)
  console.log('The separator is: ', separator)
  console.log('The array has ', arrayOfStrings.length, ' elements: ', arrayOfStrings.join(' / '))
}

const tempestString = 'Oh brave new world that has such people in it.'
const monthString = 'Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec'

const space = ' '
const comma = ','

splitString(tempestString, space)
splitString(tempestString)
splitString(monthString, comma)
```

This example produces the following output:

```plain
The original string is: "Oh brave new world that has such people in it."
The separator is: " "
The array has 10 elements: Oh / brave / new / world / that / has / such / people / in / it.

The original string is: "Oh brave new world that has such people in it."
The separator is: "undefined"
The array has 1 elements: Oh brave new world that has such people in it.

The original string is: "Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sep,Oct,Nov,Dec"
The separator is: ","
The array has 12 elements: Jan / Feb / Mar / Apr / May / Jun / Jul / Aug / Sep / Oct / Nov / Dec
```

### Removing spaces from a string

In the following example, `split()` looks for zero or more spaces, followed
by a semicolon, followed by zero or more spaces—and, when found, removes the spaces and
the semicolon from the string. `nameList` is the array returned as a result
of `split()`.

```js
const names = 'Harry Trump ;Fred Barney; Helen Rigby ; Bill Abel ;Chris Hand '

console.log(names)

const re = /\s*(?:;|$)\s*/
const nameList = names.split(re)

console.log(nameList)
```

This logs two lines; the first line logs the original string, and the second line logs
the resulting array.

```plain
Harry Trump ;Fred Barney; Helen Rigby ; Bill Abel ;Chris Hand
[ "Harry Trump", "Fred Barney", "Helen Rigby", "Bill Abel", "Chris Hand", "" ]
```

### Returning a limited number of splits

In the following example, `split()` looks for spaces in a string and returns
the first 3 splits that it finds.

```js
const myString = 'Hello World. How are you doing?'
const splits = myString.split(' ', 3)

console.log(splits)
```

This script displays the following:

```js
["Hello", "World.", "How"]
```

### Splitting with a `RegExp` to include parts of the separator in the result

If `separator` is a regular expression that contains capturing
parentheses ` (``) `, matched results are included in the array.

```js
const myString = 'Hello 1 word. Sentence number 2.'
const splits = myString.split(/(\d)/)

console.log(splits)
```

This script displays the following:

```js
[ "Hello ", "1", " word. Sentence number ", "2", "." ]
```

> **Note:** `\d` matches the [character
> class](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions/Character_Classes) for digits between 0 and 9.

### Reversing a String using `split()`

> **Warning:** This is not a robust way to reverse a string:
>
> ```js example-bad
> const str = 'asdfghjkl'
> const strReverse = str.split('').reverse().join('')
> // 'lkjhgfdsa'
>
> // split() returns an array on which reverse() and join() can be applied
> ```
>
> It doesn't work if the string contains grapheme clusters, even when using a
> unicode-aware split. (Use, for example, [esrever](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/esrever) instead.)
>
> ```js example-bad
> const str = 'mañana mañana'
> const strReverse = str.split('').reverse().join('')
> // => "anãnam anañam" // notice how the first word has an ã rather ñ
> ```
>
> **Bonus:** use {{jsxref("Operators", "===",
    "#Identity_strict_equality_(===)")}} operator to test if the original string was a
> palindrome.
