{{JSRef}}

The static **`Atomics.waitAsync()`** method waits asynchronously on a shared memory location and returns a {{jsxref("Promise")}}.

Unlike {{jsxref("Atomics.wait()")}}, `waitAsync` is non-blocking and usable on the main thread.

> **Note:** This operation only works with a shared {{jsxref("Int32Array")}} or {{jsxref("BigInt64Array")}}.

## Syntax

```js
Atomics.waitAsync(typedArray, index, value)
Atomics.waitAsync(typedArray, index, value, timeout)
```

### Parameters

- `typedArray`
  - : A shared {{jsxref("Int32Array")}} or {{jsxref("BigInt64Array")}}.
- `index`
  - : The position in the `typedArray` to wait on.
- `value`
  - : The expected value to test.
- `timeout` {{optional_inline}}
  - : Time to wait in milliseconds. {{jsxref("Infinity")}}, if no time is provided.

### Return value

A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that resolves to one of the following result objects:

```js
{ async: false, value: 'ok' }
{ async: false, value: 'not-equal' } 
{ async: false, value: 'timed-out' }
{ async: true, value: promise }
```

## Examples

### Using waitAsync()

Given a shared `Int32Array`.

```js
const sab = new SharedArrayBuffer(1024);
const int32 = new Int32Array(sab);
```

A reading thread is sleeping and waiting on location 0 which is expected to be 0. 
The `result` promise is returned immediately.

```js
const result = Atomics.waitAsync(int32, 0, 0, 1000);
// { async: true, value: promise }
```

In the reading thread or in another thread, the memory location 0 is called and the promise can be resolved with `"ok"`.

```js
Atomics.notify(int32, 0);
// { async: false, value: "ok" }
```

If it isn't resolving to `"ok"`, the value in the shared memory location wasn't the expected  (the promise will resolve to `"not-equal"`) or the timeout was reached (the promise will resolve to `"time-out"`).
