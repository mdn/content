{{JSRef}}

The **`Intl.Locale.prototype.collation`** accessor property returns the [collation type](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-collation.html#CLDR_Collation) for the `Locale`, which is used to order strings according to the locale's rules.

## Description

Collation is the process of ordering strings of characters. It is used whenever strings must be sorted and placed into a certain order, from search query results to ordering records in a database. While the idea of placing strings in order might seem trivial, the idea of order can vary from region to region and language to language. The `collation` property's value is set at construction time, either through the `co` key of the locale identifier or through the `collation` option of the {{jsxref("Intl/Locale/Locale", "Intl.Locale()")}} constructor. The latter takes priority if they are both present; and if neither is present, the property has value `undefined`.

For a list of supported collation types, see [`Intl.Locale.prototype.collations`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale/collations#supported_collation_types).

The set accessor of `collation` is `undefined`. You cannot change this property directly.

## Examples

Like other locale subtags, the collation type can be added to the {{jsxref("Intl.Locale")}} object via the locale string, or a configuration object argument to the constructor.

### Adding a collation type via the locale string

In the [Unicode locale string spec](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/), collation types are locale key "extension subtags". These subtags add additional data about the locale, and are added to locale identifiers by using the `-u` extension. Thus, the collation type can be added to the initial locale identifier string that is passed into the {{jsxref("Intl/Locale/Locale", "Intl.Locale()")}} constructor. To add the collation type, first add the `-u` extension to the string. Next, add the `-co` extension to indicate that you are adding a collation type. Finally, add the collation type to the string.

```js
const locale = new Intl.Locale("zh-Hant-u-co-zhuyin");
console.log(locale.collation); // "zhuyin"
```

### Adding a collation type via the configuration object argument

The {{jsxref("Intl/Locale/Locale", "Intl.Locale()")}} constructor has an optional configuration object argument, which can contain any of several extension types, including collation types. Set the `collation` property of the configuration object to your desired collation type, and then pass it into the constructor.

```js
const locale = new Intl.Locale("zh-Hant", { collation: "zhuyin" });
console.log(locale.collation); // "zhuyin"
```
