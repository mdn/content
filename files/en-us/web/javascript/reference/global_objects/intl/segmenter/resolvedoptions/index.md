## Syntax

```js-nolint
resolvedOptions()
```

### Parameters

None.

### Return value

A new object with properties reflecting the locale and collation options computed

## Description

The resulting object has the following properties:

- `locale`
  - : The BCP 47 language tag for the locale actually used. If any Unicode extension
    values were requested in the input BCP 47 language tag that led to this locale,
    the key-value pairs that were requested and are supported for this locale are
    included in `locale`.
- `granularity`
  - : The value provided for this property in the `options` argument or filled
    in as the default.

## Examples

### Basic usage

```js
const spanishSegmenter = new Intl.Segmenter("es", { granularity: "sentence" });
const options = spanishSegmenter.resolvedOptions();
console.log(options.locale); // "es"
console.log(options.granularity); // "sentence"
```

### Default granularity

```js
const spanishSegmenter = new Intl.Segmenter("es");
const options = spanishSegmenter.resolvedOptions();
console.log(options.locale); // "es"
console.log(options.granularity); // "grapheme"
```

### Fallback locale

```js
const banSegmenter = new Intl.Segmenter("ban");
const options = banSegmenter.resolvedOptions();
console.log(options.locale);
// "fr" on a runtime where the Balinese locale
// is not supported and French is the default locale
console.log(options.granularity); // "grapheme"
```
