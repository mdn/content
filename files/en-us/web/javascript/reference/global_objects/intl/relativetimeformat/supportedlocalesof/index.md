## Syntax

```js
Intl.RelativeTimeFormat.supportedLocalesOf(locales);
Intl.RelativeTimeFormat.supportedLocalesOf(locales, options);
```

### Parameters

- `locales`
  - : A string with a BCP 47 language tag, or an array of such strings. For the general form of the `locales` argument, see the {{jsxref("Intl", "Intl", "#Locale_identification_and_negotiation", 1)}} page.
- `options` {{optional_inline}}

  - : An object that may have the following property:

    - `localeMatcher`
      - : The locale matching algorithm to use. Possible values are "`lookup`" and "`best fit`"; the default is "`best fit`". For information about this option, see the {{jsxref("Intl", "Intl", "#Locale_negotiation", 1)}} page.

### Return value

An array of strings representing a subset of the given locale tags that are supported in date and time formatting without having to fall back to the runtime's default locale.

## Description

Returns an array with a subset of the language tags provided in `locales`. The language tags returned are those for which the runtime supports a locale in date and time formatting that the locale matching algorithm used considers a match, so that it wouldn't have to fall back to the default locale.

## Examples

### Using supportedLocalesOf()

Assuming a runtime that supports Indonesian and German but not Balinese in date and time formatting, `supportedLocalesOf` returns the Indonesian and German language tags unchanged, even though `pinyin` collation is neither relevant to date and time formatting nor used with Indonesian, and a specialized German for Indonesia is unlikely to be supported. Note the specification of the "`lookup`" algorithm here — a "`best fit`" matcher might decide that Indonesian is an adequate match for Balinese since most Balinese speakers also understand Indonesian, and therefore return the Balinese language tag as well.

```js
const locales = ["ban", "id-u-co-pinyin", "de-ID"];
const options = { localeMatcher: "lookup" };
console.log(
  Intl.RelativeTimeFormat.supportedLocalesOf(locales, options).join(", ")
);
// → "id-u-co-pinyin, de-ID"
```
