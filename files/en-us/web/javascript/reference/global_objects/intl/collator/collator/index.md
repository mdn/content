The **`Intl.Collator()`** constructor creates
{{jsxref("Intl/Collator", "Intl.Collator")}} objects that enable language-sensitive string
comparison.

## Syntax

```js
new Intl.Collator()
new Intl.Collator(locales)
new Intl.Collator(locales, options)
```

### Parameters

- `locales` {{optional_inline}}

  - : Optional. A string with a BCP 47 language tag, or an array of such strings. For
    the general form and interpretation of the `locales` argument, see
    the {{jsxref("Global_Objects/Intl", "Intl page",
			"#Locale_identification_and_negotiation", 1)}}.

    The following Unicode extension keys are allowed:

    > **Note:** These keys can usually also be set with `options` (as listed
    > below). When both are set, the `options` property takes
    > precedence.

    - `co`
      - : Variant collations for certain locales. Possible values include:
        "`big5han`", "`dict`", "`direct`",
        "`ducet`", "`gb2312`", "`phonebk`",
        "`phonetic`", "`pinyin`", "`reformed`",
        "`searchjl`", "`stroke`", "`trad`",
        "`unihan`". This option can be also be set through the
        `options` property
        "`collation`".
    - `kn`
      - : Whether numeric collation should be used, such that "1" < "2" <
        "10". Possible values are "`true`" and "`false`".
        This option can be also be set through the `options`
        property "`numeric`".
    - `kf`
      - : Whether upper case or lower case should sort first. Possible values are
        "`upper`", "`lower`", or "`false`" (use
        the locale's default). This option can be also be set through the
        `options` property
        "`caseFirst`".

- `options` {{optional_inline}}

  - : An object with some or all of the following properties:

    - `localeMatcher`
      - : The locale matching algorithm to use. Possible values are
        "`lookup`" and "`best fit`"; the default is
        "`best fit`". For information about this option, see the
        {{jsxref("Global_Objects/Intl", "Intl", "#Locale_negotiation", 1)}} page.
    - `usage`
      - : Whether the comparison is for sorting or for searching for matching
        strings. Possible values are "`sort`" and
        "`search`"; the default is "`sort`".
    - `sensitivity`

      - : Which differences in the strings should lead to non-zero result values.
        Possible values are:

        - "`base`": Only strings that differ in base letters
          compare as unequal. Examples: a ≠ b, a = á, a = A.
        - "`accent`": Only strings that differ in base letters or
          accents and other diacritic marks compare as unequal. Examples: a
          ≠ b, a ≠ á, a = A.
        - "`case`": Only strings that differ in base letters or
          case compare as unequal. Examples: a ≠ b, a = á, a ≠ A.
        - "`variant`": Strings that differ in base letters,
          accents and other diacritic marks, or case compare as unequal.
          Other differences may also be taken into consideration. Examples:
          a ≠ b, a ≠ á, a ≠ A.

        The default is "`variant`" for usage "`sort`";
        it's locale dependent for usage "`search`".

    - `ignorePunctuation`
      - : Whether punctuation should be ignored. Possible values are
        `true` and `false`; the default is
        `false`.
    - `numeric`

      - : Whether numeric collation should be used, such that "1" < "2" <
        "10". Possible values are `true` and `false`; the
        default is `false`.

        > **Note:** This option can also be set through the `kn` Unicode
        > extension key; if both are provided, this `options`
        > property takes precedence.

    - `caseFirst`

      - : Whether upper case or lower case should sort first. Possible values are
        "`upper`", "`lower`", or "`false`" (use
        the locale's default). This option can be set through an
        `options` property or through a Unicode extension
        key; if both are provided, the `options` property
        takes precedence.

        > **Note:** This option can also be set through the `kf` Unicode
        > extension key; if both are provided, this `options`
        > property takes precedence.

    - `collation`

      - : Variant collations for certain locales. Possible values include:
        "`big5han`", "`dict`", "`direct`",
        "`ducet`", "`gb2312`", "`phonebk`" (only
        supported in German), "`phonetic`", "`pinyin`",
        "`reformed`", "`searchjl`", "`stroke`",
        "`trad`", "`unihan`".

        > **Note:** This option can also be set through the `co` Unicode
        > extension key; if both are provided, this `options`
        > property takes precedence.

## Examples

### Using Collator

The following example demonstrates the different potential results for a string
occurring before, after, or at the same level as another:

```js
console.log(new Intl.Collator().compare('a', 'c')); // → a negative value
console.log(new Intl.Collator().compare('c', 'a')); // → a positive value
console.log(new Intl.Collator().compare('a', 'a')); // → 0
```

Note that the results shown in the code above can vary between browsers and browser
versions. This is because the values are implementation-specific. That is, the
specification requires only that the before and after values are negative and
positive.
