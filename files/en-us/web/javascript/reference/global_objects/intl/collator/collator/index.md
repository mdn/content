{{JSRef}}

The **`Intl.Collator()`** constructor creates {{jsxref("Intl.Collator")}} objects.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/intl-collator.html")}}

## Syntax

```js-nolint
new Intl.Collator()
new Intl.Collator(locales)
new Intl.Collator(locales, options)

Intl.Collator()
Intl.Collator(locales)
Intl.Collator(locales, options)
```

> **Note:** `Intl.Collator()` can be called with or without [`new`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/new). Both create a new `Intl.Collator` instance.

### Parameters

- `locales` {{optional_inline}}

  - : A string with a BCP 47 language tag or an {{jsxref("Intl.Locale")}} instance, or an array of such locale identifiers. The runtime's default locale is used when `undefined` is passed or when none of the specified locale identifiers is supported. For the general form and interpretation of the `locales` argument, see [the parameter description on the `Intl` main page](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl#locales_argument).

    The following Unicode extension keys are allowed:

    - `co`
      - : See [`collation`](#collation).
    - `kn`
      - : See [`numeric`](#numeric).
    - `kf`
      - : See [`caseFirst`](#casefirst).

    These keys can also be set with `options` (as listed below). When both are set, the `options` property takes precedence.

- `options` {{optional_inline}}

  - : An object containing the following properties, in the order they are retrieved (all of them are optional):

    - `usage`
      - : Whether the comparison is for sorting a list of strings or fuzzy (for the Latin script diacritic-insensitive and case-insensitive) filtering a list of strings by key. Possible values are:
        - `"sort"` (default)
          - : For sorting a list of strings.
        - `"search"`
          - : For filtering a list of strings by testing each list item for a full-string match against a key. With `"search"`, the caller should only pay attention to whether `compare()` returns zero or non-zero and should not distinguish the non-zero return values from each other. That is, it is inappropriate to use `"search"` for sorting/ordering.
    - `localeMatcher`
      - : The locale matching algorithm to use. Possible values are `"lookup"` and `"best fit"`; the default is `"best fit"`. For information about this option, see [Locale identification and negotiation](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl#locale_identification_and_negotiation).
    - `collation`
      - : Variant collations for certain locales, such as `"emoji"`, `"pinyin"`, `"stroke"`, and so on. For a list of supported collation types, see [`Intl.Locale.prototype.getCollations()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Locale/getCollations#supported_collation_types); the default is `"default"`. This option can also be set through the `co` Unicode extension key; if both are provided, this `options` property takes precedence.
    - `numeric`
      - : Whether numeric collation should be used, such that "1" < "2" < "10". Possible values are `true` and `false`; the default is `false`. This option can also be set through the `kn` Unicode extension key; if both are provided, this `options` property takes precedence.
    - `caseFirst`
      - : Whether upper case or lower case should sort first. Possible values are `"upper"`, `"lower"`, and `"false"` (use the locale's default); the default is `"false"`. This option can also be set through the `kf` Unicode extension key; if both are provided, this `options` property takes precedence.
    - `sensitivity`

      - : Which differences in the strings should lead to non-zero result values. Possible values are:

        - `"base"`
          - : Only strings that differ in base letters compare as unequal. Examples: a ≠ b, a = á, a = A.
        - `"accent"`
          - : Only strings that differ in base letters or accents and other diacritic marks compare as unequal. Examples: a ≠ b, a ≠ á, a = A.
        - `"case"`
          - : Only strings that differ in base letters or case compare as unequal. Examples: a ≠ b, a = á, a ≠ A.
        - `"variant"`
          - : Strings that differ in base letters, accents and other diacritic marks, or case compare as unequal. Other differences may also be taken into consideration. Examples: a ≠ b, a ≠ á, a ≠ A.

        The default is `"variant"` for usage `"sort"`; it's locale dependent for usage `"search"` per spec, but the core functionality of `"search"` is accent-insensitive and case-insensitive filtering, so `"base"` makes the most sense (and perhaps `"case"`).

    - `ignorePunctuation`
      - : Whether punctuation should be ignored. Possible values are `true` and `false`; the default is `false`.

### Exceptions

- {{jsxref("RangeError")}}
  - : Thrown if `locales` or `options` contain invalid values.

## Examples

### Using Collator

The following example demonstrates the different potential results for a string
occurring before, after, or at the same level as another:

```js
console.log(new Intl.Collator().compare("a", "c")); // -1, or some other negative value
console.log(new Intl.Collator().compare("c", "a")); // 1, or some other positive value
console.log(new Intl.Collator().compare("a", "a")); // 0
```

Note that the results shown in the code above can vary between browsers and browser
versions. This is because the values are implementation-specific. That is, the
specification requires only that the before and after values are negative and
positive.

When usage is `"search"`, the caller should only pay attention to whether the return value of `compare()` is zero or non-zero. It is inappropriate to use a `Collator` with usage `"search"` for sorting.
