{{JSRef}}

The **`cause`** data property of an {{jsxref("Error")}} instance indicates the specific original cause of the error.

It is used when catching and re-throwing an error with a more-specific or useful error message in order to still have access to the original error.

## Value

The value that was passed to the [`Error()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/Error) constructor in the `options.cause` argument. It may not be present.

{{js_property_attributes(1, 0, 1)}}

## Description

The value of `cause` can be of any type. You should not make assumptions that the error you caught has an `Error` as its `cause`, in the same way that you cannot be sure the variable bound in the `catch` statement is an `Error` either. The "Providing structured data as the error cause" example below shows a case where a non-error is deliberately provided as the cause.

## Examples

### Rethrowing an error with a cause

It is sometimes useful to catch an error and re-throw it with a new message.
In this case you should pass the original error into the constructor for the new `Error`, as shown.

```js
try {
  connectToDatabase();
} catch (err) {
  throw new Error('Connecting to database failed.', { cause: err });
}
```

For a more detailed example see [Error > Differentiate between similar errors](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error#differentiate_between_similar_errors).

### Providing structured data as the error cause

Error messages written for human consumption may be inappropriate for machine parsing — since they're subject to rewording or punctuation changes that may break any existing parsing written to consume them. So when throwing an error from a function, as an alternative to a human-readable error message, you can instead provide the cause as structured data, for machine parsing.

```js
function makeRSA(p, q) {
  if (!Number.isInteger(p) || !Number.isInteger(q)) {
    throw new Error('RSA key generation requires integer inputs.', {
      cause: { code: 'NonInteger', values: [p, q] },
    });
  }
  if (!areCoprime(p, q)) {
    throw new Error('RSA key generation requires two co-prime integers.', {
      cause: { code: 'NonCoprime', values: [p, q] },
    })
  }
  // rsa algorithm…
}
```
