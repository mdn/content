{{JSRef}}

The **`Promise.allSettled()`** static method takes an iterable of promises as input and returns a single {{jsxref("Promise")}}. This returned promise fulfills when all of the input's promises settle (including when an empty iterable is passed), with an array of objects that describe the outcome of each promise.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/promise-allsettled.html")}}

## Syntax

```js-nolint
Promise.allSettled(iterable)
```

### Parameters

- `iterable`
  - : An [iterable](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#the_iterable_protocol) (such as an {{jsxref("Array")}}) of promises.

### Return value

A {{jsxref("Promise")}} that is:

- **Already fulfilled**, if the `iterable` passed is empty.
- **Asynchronously fulfilled**, when all promises in the given `iterable` have settled (either fulfilled or rejected). The fulfillment value is an array of objects, each describing the outcome of one promise in the `iterable`, in the order of the promises passed, regardless of completion order. Each outcome object has the following properties:

  - `status`
    - : A string, either `"fulfilled"` or `"rejected"`, indicating the eventual state of the promise.
  - `value`
    - : Only present if `status` is `"fulfilled"`. The value that the promise was fulfilled with.
  - `reason`
    - : Only present if `status` is `"rejected"`. The reason that the promise was rejected with.

  If the `iterable` passed is non-empty but contains no pending promises, the returned promise is still asynchronously (instead of synchronously) fulfilled.

## Description

The `Promise.allSettled()` method is one of the [promise concurrency](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise#promise_concurrency) methods. `Promise.allSettled()` is typically used when you have multiple asynchronous tasks that are not dependent on one another to complete successfully, or you'd always like to know the result of each promise.

In comparison, the Promise returned by {{jsxref("Promise.all()")}} may be more appropriate if the tasks are dependent on each other, or if you'd like to immediately reject upon any of them rejecting.

## Examples

### Using Promise.allSettled()

```js
Promise.allSettled([
  Promise.resolve(33),
  new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve(66), 0)),
  99,
  Promise.reject(new Error("an error")),
]).then((values) => console.log(values));

// [
//   { status: 'fulfilled', value: 33 },
//   { status: 'fulfilled', value: 66 },
//   { status: 'fulfilled', value: 99 },
//   { status: 'rejected', reason: Error: an error }
// ]
```
