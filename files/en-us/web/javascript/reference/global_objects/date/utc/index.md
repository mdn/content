{{JSRef}}

The **`Date.UTC()`** static method accepts parameters similar to the
{{jsxref("Date")}} constructor, but treats them as UTC. It returns the number of
milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
Date.UTC(year)
Date.UTC(year, monthIndex)
Date.UTC(year, monthIndex, day)
Date.UTC(year, monthIndex, day, hour)
Date.UTC(year, monthIndex, day, hour, minute)
Date.UTC(year, monthIndex, day, hour, minute, second)
Date.UTC(year, monthIndex, day, hour, minute, second, millisecond)
```

- `year`

  - : Integer value representing the year.

    Values from `0` to `99` map to the years
    `1900` to `1999`. All other values are the actual year.
    See the [example](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date#interpretation_of_two-digit_years).

- `monthIndex` {{optional_inline}}
  - : An integer between `0` (January) and `11` (December)
    representing the month. Since ECMAScript 2017 it defaults to `0` if
    omitted. _(Up until ECMAScript 2016, `monthIndex` was a required
    parameter. As of ES2017, it no longer is.)_
- `day` {{optional_inline}}
  - : An integer between `1` and `31` representing the day of the
    month. If omitted, defaults to `1`.
- `hour` {{optional_inline}}
  - : An integer between `0` and `23` representing the hours. If
    omitted, defaults to `0`.
- `minute` {{optional_inline}}
  - : An integer between `0` and `59` representing the minutes. If
    omitted, defaults to `0`.
- `second` {{optional_inline}}
  - : An integer between `0` and `59` representing the seconds. If
    omitted, defaults to `0`.
- `millisecond` {{optional_inline}}
  - : An integer between `0` and `999` representing the
    milliseconds. If omitted, defaults to `0`.

### Return value

A number representing the number of milliseconds for the given date since January 1,
1970, 00:00:00, UTC.

## Description

`UTC()` takes comma-delimited date and time parameters and returns the
number of milliseconds between January 1, 1970, 00:00:00, universal time and the
specified date and time.

Years between `0` and `99` are converted to a year in the
20th century `(1900 + year)`. For example, `95` is
converted to the year `1995`.

The `UTC()` method differs from the {{jsxref("Date")}} constructor in two
ways:

1. `Date.UTC()` uses universal time instead of the local time.
2. `Date.UTC()` returns a time value as a number instead of creating a
   {{jsxref("Date")}} object.

If a parameter is outside of the expected range, the `UTC()` method updates
the other parameters to accommodate the value. For example, if `15` is used
for `monthIndex`, the year will be incremented by 1
`(year + 1)` and `3` will be used for the month.

`UTC()` is a static method of {{jsxref("Date")}}, so it's called as
`Date.UTC()` rather than as a method of a {{jsxref("Date")}} instance.

## Examples

### Using Date.UTC()

The following statement creates a {{jsxref("Date")}} object with the arguments treated
as UTC instead of local:

```js
const utcDate = new Date(Date.UTC(2018, 11, 1, 0, 0, 0));
```

### Compatibility notes

#### Date.UTC() with fewer than two arguments

When providing less than two arguments to `Date.UTC()`, ECMAScript 2017
requires that {{jsxref("NaN")}} is returned. Engines that weren't supporting this
behavior have been updated (see [bug 1050755](https://bugzil.la/1050755),
[ecma-262 #642](https://github.com/tc39/ecma262/pull/642)).

```js
Date.UTC();
Date.UTC(1);

// Safari: NaN
// Chrome/Opera/V8: NaN

// Firefox <54: non-NaN
// Firefox 54+: NaN

// IE: non-NaN
// Edge: NaN
```
