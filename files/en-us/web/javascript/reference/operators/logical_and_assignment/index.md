The **logical AND assignment (`x &&= y`)** operator only assigns if `x` is {{Glossary("truthy")}}.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/expressions-logical-and-assignment.html")}}

## Syntax

```js-nolint
x &&= y
```

## Description

Logical AND assignment [_short-circuits_](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence#short-circuiting), meaning that `x &&= y` is equivalent to:

```js
x && (x = y);
```

No assignment is performed if the left-hand side is not truthy, due to short-circuiting of the [logical AND](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND) operator. For example, the following does not throw an error, despite `x` being `const`:

```js
const x = 0;
x &&= 2;
```

Neither would the following trigger the setter:

```js
const x = {
  get value() {
    return 0;
  },
  set value(v) {
    console.log("Setter called");
  },
};

x.value &&= 2;
```

In fact, if `x` is not truthy, `y` is not evaluated at all.

```js
const x = 0;
x &&= console.log("y evaluated");
// Logs nothing
```

## Examples

### Using logical AND assignment

```js
let x = 0;
let y = 1;

x &&= 0; // 0
x &&= 1; // 0
y &&= 1; // 1
y &&= 0; // 0
```
