The exponentiation operator (`**`) returns the result of raising the first
operand to the power of the second operand. It is equivalent to `Math.pow`,
except it also accepts BigInts as operands.

## Syntax

```js
x ** y
```

## Description

The exponentiation operator is
right-associative: `a ** b ** c` is equal to
`a ** (b ** c)`.

In most languages, such as PHP, Python, and others that have an exponentiation operator
(`**`), the exponentiation operator is defined to have a higher precedence
than unary operators, such as unary `+` and unary `-`, but there
are a few exceptions. For example, in Bash, the `**` operator is defined to
have a lower precedence than unary operators.

In JavaScript, it is impossible to write an ambiguous exponentiation expression. That
is, you cannot put a unary operator (`+/-/~/!/delete/void/typeof`)
immediately before the base number; doing so will cause a SyntaxError.

```js
-2 ** 2;
// 4 in Bash, -4 in other languages.
// This is invalid in JavaScript, as the operation is ambiguous.

-(2 ** 2);
// -4 in JavaScript and the author's intention is unambiguous.
```

Note that some programming languages use the caret symbol <kbd>^</kbd> for
exponentiation, but JavaScript uses that symbol for the [bitwise
logical XOR operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_XOR).

## Examples

### Basic exponentiation

```js
2 ** 3   // 8
3 ** 2   // 9
3 ** 2.5 // 15.588457268119896
10 ** -1 // 0.1
NaN ** 2 // NaN
```

### Associativity

```js
2 ** 3 ** 2   // 512
2 ** (3 ** 2) // 512
(2 ** 3) ** 2 // 64
```

### Usage with unary operators

To invert the sign of the result of an exponentiation expression:

```js
-(2 ** 2) // -4
```

To force the base of an exponentiation expression to be a negative number:

```js
(-2) ** 2 // 4
```
