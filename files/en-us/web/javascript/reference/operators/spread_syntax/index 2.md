**Spread syntax** (`...`) allows an iterable such as an array
expression or string to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for
function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, or an object expression
to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are
expected.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/expressions-spreadsyntax.html")}}

## Description

Spread syntax can be used when all elements from an object or array need to be included
in a list of some kind.

In the above example, the defined function takes `x`, `y`, and
`z` as arguments and returns the sum of these values. An array value is also
defined.

When we invoke the function, we pass it all the values in the array using the spread
syntax and the array name — `...numbers`.

If the array contained more than three numbers, e.g. `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, then it
would still work fine, except that all four would be passed, but only the first three
would be used unless you added more arguments to the function, e.g.:

```js
function sum(x, y, z, n) {
  return x + y + z + n;
}
```

The above example is somewhat rigid; the real value in spread syntax is that it works
with the same value, no matter how many elements are contained in the object, array,
etc.

It is commonly used when you want to add a new item to a local data store, or display
all stored items plus a new addition. A very simple version of this kind of action
could look like so:

```js
let numberStore = [0, 1, 2];
let newNumber = 12;
numberStore = [...numberStore, newNumber];
```

In the above example you can rerun the last line as many times as you like, to keep
adding an additional 12 to the end of the array.

## Syntax

For function calls:

```js
myFunction(...iterableObj); // pass all elements of iterableObj as arguments to function myFunction
```

For array literals or strings:

```js
[...iterableObj, '4', 'five', 6]; // combine two arrays by inserting all elements from iterableObj
```

For object literals (new in ECMAScript 2018):

```js
let objClone = { ...obj }; // pass all key:value pairs from an object 
```

## Rest syntax (parameters)

Rest syntax looks exactly like spread syntax. In a way, rest syntax is the opposite of
spread syntax. Spread syntax "expands" an array into its elements, while rest syntax
collects multiple elements and "condenses" them into a single element. See
{{jsxref("Functions/rest_parameters", "rest parameters", "", 1)}}.

## Examples

### Spread in function calls

#### Replace apply()

It is common to use {{jsxref("Function.prototype.apply()")}} in cases where you want to
use the elements of an array as arguments to a function.

```js
function myFunction(x, y, z) { }
let args = [0, 1, 2];
myFunction.apply(null, args);
```

With spread syntax the above can be written as:

```js
function myFunction(x, y, z) { }
let args = [0, 1, 2];
myFunction(...args);
```

Any argument in the argument list can use spread syntax, and the spread syntax can be
used multiple times.

```js
function myFunction(v, w, x, y, z) { }
let args = [0, 1];
myFunction(-1, ...args, 2, ...[3]);
```

#### Apply for new operator

When calling a constructor with {{jsxref("Operators/new", "new")}} it's not possible to
**directly** use an array and `apply()` (`apply()`
does a `[[Call]]` and not a `[[Construct]]`). However, an array
can be easily used with `new` thanks to spread syntax:

```js
let dateFields = [1970, 0, 1];  // 1 Jan 1970
let d = new Date(...dateFields);
```

To use `new` with an array of parameters without spread syntax, you would
have to do it **indirectly** through partial application:

```js
function applyAndNew(constructor, args) {
   function partial () {
      return constructor.apply(this, args);
   };
   if (typeof constructor.prototype === "object") {
      partial.prototype = Object.create(constructor.prototype);
   }
   return partial;
}

function myConstructor () {
   console.log("arguments.length: " + arguments.length);
   console.log(arguments);
   this.prop1="val1";
   this.prop2="val2";
};

let myArguments = ["hi", "how", "are", "you", "mr", null];
let myConstructorWithArguments = applyAndNew(myConstructor, myArguments);

console.log(new myConstructorWithArguments);
//  (internal log of myConstructor):           arguments.length: 6
//  (internal log of myConstructor):           ["hi", "how", "are", "you", "mr", null]
//  (log of "new myConstructorWithArguments"): {prop1: "val1", prop2: "val2"}
```

### Spread in array literals

#### A more powerful array literal

Without spread syntax, to create a new array using an existing array as one part of it,
the array literal syntax is no longer sufficient and imperative code must be used
instead using a combination of {{jsxref("Array.prototype.push", "push()")}},
{{jsxref("Array.prototype.splice", "splice()")}}, {{jsxref("Array.prototype.concat",
   "concat()")}}, etc. With spread syntax this becomes much more succinct:

```js
let parts = ['shoulders', 'knees'];
let lyrics = ['head', ...parts, 'and', 'toes'];
//  ["head", "shoulders", "knees", "and", "toes"]
```

Just like spread for argument lists, `...` can be used anywhere in the array
literal, and may be used more than once.

#### Copy an array

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = [...arr]; // like arr.slice()

arr2.push(4);
//  arr2 becomes [1, 2, 3, 4]
//  arr remains unaffected
```

> **Note:** Spread syntax effectively goes one level deep while copying
> an array. Therefore, it may be unsuitable for copying multidimensional arrays, as
> the following example shows. (The same is true with {{jsxref("Object.assign()")}}
> and spread syntax.)
>
> ```js example-bad
> let a = [[1], [2], [3]];
> let b = [...a];
>
> b.shift().shift();
> //  1
>
> //  Oh no!  Now array 'a' is affected as well:
> a
> //  [[], [2], [3]]
> ```

#### A better way to concatenate arrays

{{jsxref("Array.prototype.concat()")}} is often used to concatenate an array to the end
of an existing array. Without spread syntax, this is done as:

```js
let arr1 = [0, 1, 2];
let arr2 = [3, 4, 5];

//  Append all items from arr2 onto arr1
arr1 = arr1.concat(arr2);
```

With spread syntax this becomes:

```js
let arr1 = [0, 1, 2];
let arr2 = [3, 4, 5];

arr1 = [...arr1, ...arr2];
//  arr1 is now [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// Note: Not to use const otherwise, it will give TypeError (invalid assignment)
```

{{jsxref("Array.prototype.unshift()")}} is often used to insert an array of values at
the start of an existing array. Without spread syntax, this is done as:

```js
let arr1 = [0, 1, 2];
let arr2 = [3, 4, 5];

//  Prepend all items from arr2 onto arr1
Array.prototype.unshift.apply(arr1, arr2)

//  arr1 is now [3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2]
```

With spread syntax, this becomes:

```js
let arr1 = [0, 1, 2];
let arr2 = [3, 4, 5];

arr1 = [...arr2, ...arr1];
//  arr1 is now [3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2]
```

> **Note:** Unlike `unshift()`, this creates a new
> `arr1`, and does not modify the original `arr1` array
> in-place.

### Spread in object literals

The [Rest/Spread
Properties for ECMAScript](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-object-rest-spread) proposal (ES2018) added spread properties to
{{jsxref("Operators/Object_initializer", "object literals", 1)}}. It copies own
enumerable properties from a provided object onto a new object.

Shallow-cloning (excluding prototype) or merging of objects is now possible using a
shorter syntax than {{jsxref("Object.assign()")}}.

```js
let obj1 = { foo: 'bar', x: 42 };
let obj2 = { foo: 'baz', y: 13 };

let clonedObj = { ...obj1 };
// Object { foo: "bar", x: 42 }

let mergedObj = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
// Object { foo: "baz", x: 42, y: 13 }
```

Note that {{jsxref("Object.assign()")}} triggers {{jsxref("Functions/set",
   "setters")}}, whereas spread syntax doesn't.

Note that you cannot replace or mimic the {{jsxref("Object.assign()")}} function:

```js
let obj1 = { foo: 'bar', x: 42 };
let obj2 = { foo: 'baz', y: 13 };
const merge = ( ...objects ) => ( { ...objects } );

let mergedObj1 = merge (obj1, obj2);
// Object { 0: { foo: 'bar', x: 42 }, 1: { foo: 'baz', y: 13 } }

let mergedObj2 = merge ({}, obj1, obj2);
// Object { 0: {}, 1: { foo: 'bar', x: 42 }, 2: { foo: 'baz', y: 13 } }
```

In the above example, the spread syntax does not work as one might expect: it spreads
an _array_ of arguments into the object literal, due to the rest parameter.

### Only for iterables

Objects themselves are not iterable, but they become iterable when used in an Array, or
with iterating functions such as `map()`, `reduce()`, and
`assign()`. When merging 2 objects together with the spread operator, it is
assumed another iterating function is used when the merging occurs.

Spread syntax (other than in the case of spread properties) can be applied only to [iterable](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol/iterator)
objects:

```js
let obj = {'key1': 'value1'};
let array = [...obj]; // TypeError: obj is not iterable
```

### Spread with many values

When using spread syntax for function calls, be aware of the possibility of exceeding
the JavaScript engine's argument length limit. See {{jsxref("Function.prototype.apply",
   "apply()")}} for more details.
