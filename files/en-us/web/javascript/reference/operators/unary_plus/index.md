{{jsSidebar("Operators")}}

The unary plus operator (`+`) precedes its operand and evaluates to its
operand but attempts to convert it into a number, if it isn't already.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/expressions-unary-plus.html", "taller")}}

## Syntax

```js
+x;
```

## Description

Although unary negation (`-`) also can convert non-numbers, unary plus is
the fastest and preferred way of converting something into a number, because it does not
perform any other operations on the number. It can convert string representations of
integers and floats, as well as the non-string values `true`,
`false`, and `null`. Integers in both decimal and hexadecimal
(`0x`-prefixed) formats are supported. Negative numbers are supported (though
not for hex). Using the operator on BigInt valuesÂ throws a TypeError. If it cannot parse
a particular value, it will evaluate to {{jsxref("NaN")}}.

## Examples

### Usage with numbers

```js
const x = 1;
const y = -1;

console.log(+x);
// 1
console.log(+y);
// -1
```

### Usage with non-numbers

```js
+true + // 1
  false + // 0
  null + // 0
  function (val) {
    return val;
  } + // NaN
  1n; // throws TypeError: Cannot convert BigInt value to number
```
