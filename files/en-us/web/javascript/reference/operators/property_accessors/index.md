**Property accessors** provide access to an
object's properties by using the dot notation or the bracket notation.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/expressions-propertyaccessors.html", "taller")}}

## Syntax

```js
object.property
object['property']
```

## Description

One can think of an object as an _associative array_ (a.k.a. _map_,
_dictionary_, _hash_, _lookup table_). The _keys_ in this
array are the names of the object's properties.

It's typical when speaking of an object's properties to make a distinction between
properties and methods. However, the property/method distinction is little more than a
convention. A method is a property that can be called (for example, if it has a
reference to a {{jsxref("Function")}} instance as its value).

There are two ways to access properties: _dot notation_ and _bracket
notation_.

### Dot notation

In the `object.property` syntax, the `property` must
be a valid JavaScript [identifier](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Identifier). (In the
ECMAScript standard, the names of properties are technically "IdentifierNames", not
"Identifiers", so reserved words can be used but are not recommended). For example,
`object.$1` is valid, while `object.1` is
not.

```js
const variable = object.property_name;

object.property_name = value;
```

```js
const object = {};

object.$1 = 'foo';
console.log(object.$1);  // 'foo'

object.1 = 'bar';        // SyntaxError
console.log(object.1);   // SyntaxError
```

Here, the method named `createElement` is retrieved from
`document` and is called.

```js
document.createElement('pre')
```

If you use a method for a numeric literal, and the numeric literal has no exponent and
no decimal point, you should leave [white-space(s)](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Whitespace) before the dot preceding the
method call, so that the dot is not interpreted as a decimal point.

```js
77 .toExponential()
// or
77
.toExponential()
// or
;(77).toExponential()
// or
77..toExponential()
// or
77.0.toExponential()
// because 77. === 77.0, no ambiguity
```

### Bracket notation

In the `object[property_name]` syntax,
the `property_name` is just a string or [Symbol](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Symbol). So, it can be any string, including
`'1foo'`, `'!bar!'`, or even `' '` (a space).

```js
const variable = object[property_name]
object[property_name] = value;
```

This does the exact same thing as the previous example.

```js
document['createElement']('pre')
```

A space before bracket notation is allowed.

```js
document ['createElement']('pre')
```

### Property names

Property names are string or [Symbol](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Symbol). Any
other value, including a number, is coerced to a string. This outputs
`'value'`, since `1` is coerced into `'1'`.

```js
let object = {}
object['1'] = 'value'
console.log(object[1])
```

This also outputs `'value'`, since both `foo` and
`bar` are converted to the same string.

```js
let foo = {unique_prop: 1}, bar = {unique_prop: 2}, object = {};
object[foo] = 'value'
console.log(object[bar])
```

In the [SpiderMonkey](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey) JavaScript
engine, this string would be "`[object Object]`".

### Method binding

A method is not bound to the object that it is a method of. Specifically,
`this` is not fixed in a method. Put another way, `this` does not
necessarily refer to the object containing a method. Instead, `this` is
"passed" by the function call. See [method
binding](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this#method_binding).

## Examples

### Bracket notation vs. `eval`

JavaScript novices often make the mistake of using {{jsxref("Global_Objects/eval", "eval()")}} where
the bracket notation can be used instead.

For example, the following syntax is often seen in many scripts.

```js
x = eval('document.forms.form_name.elements.' + strFormControl + '.value')
```

`eval()` is slow and should be avoided whenever possible. Also,
`strFormControl` would have to hold an identifier, which is not required for
names and `id`s of form controls. It is better to use bracket notation
instead:

```js
x = document.forms['form_name'].elements[strFormControl].value
```
