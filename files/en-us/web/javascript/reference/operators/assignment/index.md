{{jsSidebar("Operators")}}

The **assignment (`=`)** operator is used to assign a value to a
variable. The assignment operation evaluates to the assigned value. Chaining the
assignment operator is possible in order to assign a single value to multiple variables.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
x = y
```

## Examples

### Simple assignment and chaining

```js
let x = 5;
let y = 10;
let z = 25;

x = y; // x is 10
x = y = z; // x, y and z are all 25
```

### Value of assignment expressions

The assignment expression itself evaluates to the value of the right-hand side, so you can log the value and assign to a variable at the same time.

```js
let x;
console.log(x); // undefined
console.log(x = 2); // 2
console.log(x); // 2
```
