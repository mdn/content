{{jsSidebar("Operators")}}

The **conditional (ternary) operator** is the
only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: a condition followed by a
question mark (`?`), then an expression to execute if the condition is
{{Glossary("truthy")}} followed by a colon (`:`), and finally the
expression to execute if the condition is {{Glossary("falsy")}}. This
operator is frequently used as alternative to an [`if...else`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)
statement.

## Syntax

```js
condition ? exprIfTrue : exprIfFalse
```

### Parameters

- `condition`
  - : An expression whose value is used as a condition.
- `exprIfTrue`
  - : An expression which is evaluated if the `condition`
    evaluates to a {{Glossary("truthy")}} value (one which equals or can be converted
    to `true`).
- `exprIfFalse`
  - : An expression which is executed if the `condition` is
    {{Glossary("falsy")}} (that is, has a value which can be converted to
    `false`).

## Description

Besides `false`, possible falsy expressions are: `null`,
`NaN`, `0`, the empty string (`""`), and
`undefined`. If `condition` is any of these, the
result of the conditional expression will be the result of executing the expression
`exprIfFalse`.

## Examples

### A simple example

```js
var age = 26;
var beverage = (age >= 21) ? "Beer" : "Juice";
console.log(beverage); // "Beer"
```

### Handling null values

One common usage is to handle a value that may be `null`:

```js
let greeting = person => {
    let name = person ? person.name : `stranger`
    return `Howdy, ${name}`
}

console.log(greeting({name: `Alice`}));  // "Howdy, Alice"
console.log(greeting(null));             // "Howdy, stranger"
```

### Conditional chains

The ternary operator is right-associative, which means it can be "chained" in the
following way, similar to an `if … else if … else if … else` chain:

```js
function example(…) {
    return condition1 ? value1
         : condition2 ? value2
         : condition3 ? value3
         : value4;
}

// Equivalent to:

function example(…) {
    if (condition1) { return value1; }
    else if (condition2) { return value2; }
    else if (condition3) { return value3; }
    else { return value4; }
}
```
