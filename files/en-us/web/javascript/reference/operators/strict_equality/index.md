{{jsSidebar("Operators")}}

The **strict equality (`===`)** operator checks whether its two operands are
equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike the [equality](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality) operator,
the strict equality operator always considers operands of different types to be
different.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
x === y
```

## Description

The strict equality operators (`===` and `!==`) provide the [IsStrictlyEqual](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness#strict_equality_using) semantic.

- If the operands are of different types, return `false`.
- If both operands are objects, return `true` only if they refer to the
  same object.
- If both operands are `null` or both operands are `undefined`,
  return `true`.
- If either operand is `NaN`, return `false`.
- Otherwise, compare the two operand's values:

  - Numbers must have the same numeric values. `+0` and `-0`
    are considered to be the same value.
  - Strings must have the same characters in the same order.
  - Booleans must be both `true` or both `false`.

The most notable difference between this operator and the [equality](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Equality)
(`==`) operator is that if the operands are of different types, the
`==` operator attempts to convert them to the same type before comparing.

## Examples

### Comparing operands of the same type

```js
"hello" === "hello"; // true
"hello" === "hola"; // false

3 === 3; // true
3 === 4; // false

true === true; // true
true === false; // false

null === null; // true
```

### Comparing operands of different types

```js
"3" === 3; // false
true === 1; // false
null === undefined; // false
3 === new Number(3); // false
```

### Comparing objects

```js
const object1 = {
  key: "value",
};

const object2 = {
  key: "value",
};

console.log(object1 === object2); // false
console.log(object1 === object1); // true
```
