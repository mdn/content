{{jsSidebar("Operators")}}

The bitwise AND operator (`&`) returns a `1` in each bit
position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are `1`s.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/expressions-bitwise-and.html")}}

## Syntax

```js
a & b;
```

## Description

The operands are converted to 32-bit integers and expressed by a series of bits (zeroes
and ones). Numbers with more than 32 bits get their most significant bits discarded. For
example, the following integerÂ with more than 32 bits will be converted to a 32 bit
integer:

```js
Before: 11100110111110100000000000000110000000000001;
After: 10100000000000000110000000000001;
```

Each bit in the first operand is paired with the corresponding bit in the second
operand: _first bit_ to _first bit_, _second bit_ to _second
bit_, and so on.

The operator is applied to each pair of bits, and the result is constructed bitwise.

The truth table for the AND operation is:

| a   | b   | a AND b |
| --- | --- | ------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0       |
| 0   | 1   | 0       |
| 1   | 0   | 0       |
| 1   | 1   | 1       |

```js
.    9 (base 10) = 00000000000000000000000000001001 (base 2)
    14 (base 10) = 00000000000000000000000000001110 (base 2)
                   --------------------------------
14 & 9 (base 10) = 00000000000000000000000000001000 (base 2) = 8 (base 10)
```

Bitwise ANDing any number `x` with `0` yields
`0`.

## Examples

### Using bitwise AND

```js
// 5: 00000000000000000000000000000101
// 2: 00000000000000000000000000000010
5 & 2; // 0
```
