The **right shift operator (`>>`)** shifts the first
operand the specified number of bits to the right. Excess bits shifted off to the right
are discarded. Copies of the leftmost bit are shifted in from the left. Since the new
leftmost bit has the same value as the previous leftmost bit, the sign bit (the leftmost
bit) does not change. Hence the name "sign-propagating".

## Syntax

```js
a >> b
```

## Description

This operator shifts the first operand the specified number of bits to the right.
Excess bits shifted off to the right are discarded. Copies of the leftmost bit are
shifted in from the left. Since the new leftmost bit has the same value as the previous
leftmost bit, the sign bit (the leftmost bit) does not change. Hence the name
"sign-propagating".

For example, `9 >> 2` yields 2:

```js
.    9 (base 10): 00000000000000000000000000001001 (base 2)
                  --------------------------------
9 >> 2 (base 10): 00000000000000000000000000000010 (base 2) = 2 (base 10)
```

Likewise, `-9 >> 2` yields `-3`, because the sign is
preserved:

```js
.    -9 (base 10): 11111111111111111111111111110111 (base 2)
                   --------------------------------
-9 >> 2 (base 10): 11111111111111111111111111111101 (base 2) = -3 (base 10)
```

## Examples

### Using right shift

```js
 9 >> 2; //  2
-9 >> 2; // -3
```
