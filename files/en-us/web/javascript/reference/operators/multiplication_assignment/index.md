{{jsSidebar("Operators")}}

The **multiplication assignment (`*=`)** operator performs [multiplication](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Multiplication) on the two operands and assigns the result to the left operand.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/expressions-multiplication-assignment.html")}}

## Syntax

```js-nolint
x *= y
```

## Description

`x *= y` is equivalent to `x = x * y`, except that the expression `x` is only evaluated once.

## Examples

### Multiplication assignment using numbers

```js
let bar = 5;
bar *= 2; // 10
```

Other non-BigInt values are coerced to numbers:

```js
let bar = 5;
bar *= "foo"; // NaN
```

### Multiplication assignment using BigInts

```js
let foo = 3n;
foo *= 2n; // 6n
foo *= 1; // TypeError: Cannot mix BigInt and other types, use explicit conversions
```
