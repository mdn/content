{{jsSidebar("Operators")}}

The **decrement (`--`)** operator decrements (subtracts one from) its operand and returns the value before or after the decrement, depending on where the operator is placed.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/expressions-decrement.html")}}

## Syntax

```js-nolint
x--
--x
```

## Description

The `--` operator is overloaded for two types of operands: number and [BigInt](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt). It first [coerces the operand to a numeric value](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#numeric_coercion) and tests the type of it. It performs BigInt decrement if the operand becomes a BigInt; otherwise, it performs number decrement.

If used postfix, with operator after operand (for example, `x--`), the decrement operator decrements and returns the value before decrementing.

If used prefix, with operator before operand (for example, `--x`), the decrement operator decrements and returns the value after decrementing.

The decrement operator can only be applied on operands that are references (variables and object properties; i.e. valid [assignment targets](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Assignment)). `--x` itself evaluates to a value, not a reference, so you cannot chain multiple decrement operators together.

```js-nolint example-bad
--(--x); // SyntaxError: Invalid left-hand side expression in prefix operation
```

## Examples

### Postfix decrement

```js
let x = 3;
const y = x--;
// x is 2; y is 3

let x2 = 3n;
const y2 = x2--;
// x2 is 2n; y2 is 3n
```

### Prefix decrement

```js
let x = 3;
const y = --x;
// x is 2; y = 2

let x2 = 3n;
const y2 = --x2;
// x2 is 2n; y2 is 2n
```
