{{JSSidebar("Operators")}}

The **nullish coalescing (`??`)** operator is a logical
operator that returns its right-hand side operand when its left-hand side operand is
[`null`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/null) or {{jsxref("undefined")}}, and otherwise returns its left-hand side
operand.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
leftExpr ?? rightExpr
```

## Description

The nullish coalescing operator can be seen as a special case of the [logical OR (`||`) operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_OR). The latter returns the right-hand side operand if the left operand is _any_ {{Glossary("falsy")}} value, not only `null` or `undefined`. In other words, if you use `||` to provide some default value to another variable `foo`, you may encounter unexpected behaviors if you consider some falsy values as usable (e.g., `''` or `0`). See [below](#assigning_a_default_value_to_a_variable) for more examples.

The nullish coalescing operator has the fifth-lowest [operator precedence](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence), directly lower than `||` and directly higher than the [conditional (ternary) operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator).

It is not possible to combine both the AND (`&&`) and OR operators (`||`) directly with `??`. A [syntax error](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Errors/Cant_use_nullish_coalescing_unparenthesized) will be thrown in such cases.

```js example-bad
null || undefined ?? "foo"; // raises a SyntaxError
true && undefined ?? "foo"; // raises a SyntaxError
```

Instead, provide parenthesis to explicitly indicate precedence:

```js example-good
(null || undefined) ?? "foo"; // returns "foo"
```

## Examples

### Using the nullish coalescing operator

In this example, we will provide default values but keep values other than `null` or `undefined`.

```js
const nullValue = null;
const emptyText = ""; // falsy
const someNumber = 42;

const valA = nullValue ?? "default for A";
const valB = emptyText ?? "default for B";
const valC = someNumber ?? 0;

console.log(valA); // "default for A"
console.log(valB); // "" (as the empty string is not null or undefined)
console.log(valC); // 42
```

### Assigning a default value to a variable

Earlier, when one wanted to assign a default value to a variable, a common pattern was to use the logical OR operator ([`||`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_OR)):

```js
let foo;

// foo is never assigned any value so it is still undefined
const someDummyText = foo || "Hello!";
```

However, due to `||` being a boolean logical operator, the left-hand-side operand was coerced to a boolean for the evaluation and any _falsy_ value (including `0`, `''`, `NaN`, `false`, etc.) was not returned. This behavior may cause unexpected consequences if you consider `0`, `''`, or `NaN` as valid values.

```js
const count = 0;
const text = "";

const qty = count || 42;
const message = text || "hi!";
console.log(qty); // 42 and not 0
console.log(message); // "hi!" and not ""
```

The nullish coalescing operator avoids this pitfall by only returning the second operand when the first one evaluates to either `null` or `undefined` (but no other falsy values):

```js
const myText = ""; // An empty string (which is also a falsy value)

const notFalsyText = myText || "Hello world";
console.log(notFalsyText); // Hello world

const preservingFalsy = myText ?? "Hi neighborhood";
console.log(preservingFalsy); // '' (as myText is neither undefined nor null)
```

### Short-circuiting

Like the OR and AND logical operators, the right-hand side expression is not evaluated if the left-hand side proves to be neither `null` nor `undefined`.

```js
function A() {
  console.log("A was called");
  return undefined;
}
function B() {
  console.log("B was called");
  return false;
}
function C() {
  console.log("C was called");
  return "foo";
}

console.log(A() ?? C());
// Logs "A was called" then "C was called" and then "foo"
// as A() returned undefined so both expressions are evaluated

console.log(B() ?? C());
// Logs "B was called" then "false"
// as B() returned false (and not null or undefined), the right
// hand side expression was not evaluated
```

### Relationship with the optional chaining operator (?.)

The nullish coalescing operator treats `undefined` and `null` as specific values. So does the [optional chaining operator (`?.`)](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Optional_chaining), which is useful to access a property of an object which may be `null` or `undefined`. Combining them, you can safely access a property of an object which may be nullish and provide a default value if it is.

```js
const foo = { someFooProp: "hi" };

console.log(foo.someFooProp?.toUpperCase() ?? "not available"); // "HI"
console.log(foo.someBarProp?.toUpperCase() ?? "not available"); // "not available"
```
