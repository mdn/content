{{jsSidebar("Operators")}}

A function's **`this`** keyword behaves a little differently in JavaScript compared to other languages. It also has some differences between [strict mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode) and non-strict mode.

In most cases, the value of `this` is determined by how a function is called (runtime binding). It can't be set by assignment during execution, and it may be different each time the function is called. The {{jsxref("Function.prototype.bind()", "bind()")}} method can [set the value of a function's `this` regardless of how it's called](#the_bind_method), and [arrow functions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) don't provide their own `this` binding (it retains the `this` value of the enclosing lexical context).

## Syntax

```js-nolint
this
```

### Value

In non–strict mode, `this` is always a reference to an object. In strict mode, it can be any value. For more information on how the value is determined, see the description below.

## Description

The value of `this` depends on in which context it appears: function, class, or global.

### Function context

Inside a function, the value of `this` depends on how the function is called. Think about `this` as a hidden parameter of a function — just like the parameters declared in the function definition, `this` is a binding that the language creates for you when the function body is evaluated.

For a typical function, the value of `this` is the object that the function is accessed on. In other words, if the function call is in the form `obj.f()`, then `this` refers to `obj`. For example:

```js
function getThis() {
  return this;
}

const obj1 = { name: "obj1" };
const obj2 = { name: "obj2" };

obj1.getThis = getThis;
obj2.getThis = getThis;

console.log(obj1.getThis()); // { name: 'obj1', getThis: [Function: getThis] }
console.log(obj2.getThis()); // { name: 'obj2', getThis: [Function: getThis] }
```

Note how the function is the same, but based on how it's invoked, the value of `this` is different. This is analogous to how function parameters work.

The value of `this` is not the object that has the function as an own property, but the object that is used to call the function. You can prove this by calling a method of an object up in the [prototype chain](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain).

```js
const obj3 = {
  __proto__: obj1,
  name: "obj3",
};

console.log(obj3.getThis()); // { name: 'obj3' }
```

The value of `this` always changes based on how a function is called, even when the function was defined on an object at creation:

```js
const obj4 = {
  name: "obj4",
  getThis() {
    return this;
  },
};

const obj5 = { name: "obj5" };

obj5.getThis = obj4.getThis;
console.log(obj5.getThis()); // { name: 'obj5', getThis: [Function: getThis] }
```

If the value that the method is accessed on is a primitive, `this` will be a primitive value as well — but only if the function is in strict mode.

```js
function getThisStrict() {
  "use strict"; // Enter strict mode
  return this;
}

// Only for demonstration — you should not mutate built-in prototypes
Number.prototype.getThisStrict = getThisStrict;
console.log(typeof (1).getThisStrict()); // "number"
```

If the function is called without being accessed on anything, `this` will be `undefined` — but only if the function is in strict mode.

```js
console.log(typeof getThisStrict()); // "undefined"
```

In non-strict mode, a special process called [`this` substitution](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode#no_this_substitution) ensures that the value of `this` is always an object. This means:

- If a function is called with `this` set to `undefined` or `null`, `this` gets substituted with {{jsxref("globalThis")}}.
- If the function is called with `this` set to a primitive value, `this` gets substituted with the primitive value's wrapper object.

```js
function getThis() {
  return this;
}

// Only for demonstration — you should not mutate built-in prototypes
Number.prototype.getThis = getThis;
console.log(typeof (1).getThis()); // "object"
console.log(getThis() === globalThis); // true
```

In typical function calls, `this` is implicitly passed like a parameter through the function's prefix (the part before the dot). You can also explicitly set the value of `this` using the {{jsxref("Function.prototype.call()")}}, {{jsxref("Function.prototype.apply()")}}, or {{jsxref("Reflect.apply()")}} methods. Using {{jsxref("Function.prototype.bind()")}}, you can create a new function with a specific value of `this` that doesn't change regardless of how the function is called. When using these methods, the `this` substitution rules above still apply if the function is non-strict.

#### Callbacks

When a function is passed as a callback, the value of `this` depends on how the callback is called, which is determined by the implementor of the API. Callbacks are _typically_ called with a `this` value of `undefined` (calling it directly without attaching it to any object), which means if the function is non–strict, the value of `this` is the global object ({{jsxref("globalThis")}}). This is the case for [iterative array methods](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#iterative_methods), the [`Promise()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/Promise) constructor, etc.

```js
function logThis() {
  "use strict";
  console.log(this);
}

[1, 2, 3].forEach(logThis); // undefined, undefined, undefined
```

Some APIs allow you to set a `this` value for invocations of the callback. For example, all iterative array methods and related ones like {{jsxref("Set.prototype.forEach()")}} accept an optional `thisArg` parameter.

```js
[1, 2, 3].forEach(logThis, { name: "obj" });
// { name: 'obj' }, { name: 'obj' }, { name: 'obj' }
```

Occasionally, a callback is called with a `this` value other than `undefined`. For example, the `reviver` parameter of {{jsxref("JSON.parse()")}} and the `replacer` parameter of {{jsxref("JSON.stringify()")}} are both called with `this` set to the object that the property being parsed/serialized belongs to.

#### Arrow functions

In [arrow functions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), `this` retains the value of the enclosing lexical context's `this`. In other words, when evaluating an arrow function's body, the language does not create a new `this` binding.

For example, in global code, `this` is always `globalThis` regardless of strictness, because of the [global context](#global_context) binding:

```js
const globalObject = this;
const foo = () => this;
console.log(foo() === globalObject); // true
```

Arrow functions create a [closure](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures) over the `this` value of its surrounding scope, which means arrow functions behave as if they are "auto-bound" — no matter how it's invoked, `this` is set to what it was when the function was created (in the example above, the global object). The same applies to arrow functions created inside other functions: their `this` remains that of the enclosing lexical context. [See example below](#this_in_arrow_functions).

Furthermore, when invoking arrow functions using `call()`, `bind()`, or `apply()`, the `thisArg` parameter is ignored. You can still pass other arguments using these methods, though.

```js
const obj = { name: "obj" };

// Attempt to set this using call
console.log(foo.call(obj) === globalObject); // true

// Attempt to set this using bind
const boundFoo = foo.bind(obj);
console.log(boundFoo() === globalObject); // true
```

#### Constructors

When a function is used as a constructor (with the {{jsxref("Operators/new", "new")}} keyword), its `this` is bound to the new object being constructed, no matter which object the constructor function is accessed on. The value of `this` becomes the value of the `new` expression unless the constructor returns another non–primitive value.

```js
function C() {
  this.a = 37;
}

let o = new C();
console.log(o.a); // 37

function C2() {
  this.a = 37;
  return { a: 38 };
}

o = new C2();
console.log(o.a); // 38
```

In the second example (`C2`), because an object was returned during construction, the new object that `this` was bound to gets discarded. (This essentially makes the statement `this.a = 37;` dead code. It's not exactly dead because it gets executed, but it can be eliminated with no outside effects.)

#### super

When a function is invoked in the `super.method()` form, the `this` inside the `method` function is the same value as the `this` value around the `super.method()` call, and is generally not equal to the object that `super` refers to. This is because `super.method` is not an object member access like the ones above — it's a special syntax with different binding rules. For examples, see the [`super` reference](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/super#calling_methods_from_super).

### Class context

A [class](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) can be split into two contexts: static and instance. [Constructors](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor), methods, and instance field initializers ([public](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Public_class_fields) or [private](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_class_fields)) belong to the instance context. [Static](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/static) methods, static field initializers, and [static initialization blocks](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Static_initialization_blocks) belong to the static context. The `this` value is different in each context.

Class constructors are always called with `new`, so their behavior is the same as [function constructors](#constructors): the `this` value is the new instance being created. Class methods behave like methods in object literals — the `this` value is the object that the method was accessed on. If the method is not transferred to another object, `this` is generally an instance of the class.

Static methods are not properties of `this`. They are properties of the class itself. Therefore, they are generally accessed on the class, and `this` is the value of the class (or a subclass). Static initialization blocks are also evaluated with `this` set to the current class.

Field initializers are also evaluated in the context of the class. Instance fields are evaluated with `this` set to the instance being constructed. Static fields are evaluated with `this` set to the current class. This is why arrow functions in field initializers are [bound to the class](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#cannot_be_used_as_methods).

```js
class C {
  instanceField = this;
  static staticField = this;
}

const c = new C();
console.log(c.instanceField === c); // true
console.log(C.staticField === C); // true
```

#### Derived class constructors

Unlike base class constructors, derived constructors have no initial `this` binding. Calling {{jsxref("Operators/super", "super()")}} creates a `this` binding within the constructor and essentially has the effect of evaluating the following line of code, where `Base` is the base class:

```js
this = new Base();
```

> **Warning:** Referring to `this` before calling `super()` will throw an error.

Derived classes must not return before calling `super()`, unless the constructor returns an object (so the `this` value is overridden) or the class has no constructor at all.

```js
class Base {}
class Good extends Base {}
class AlsoGood extends Base {
  constructor() {
    return { a: 5 };
  }
}
class Bad extends Base {
  constructor() {}
}

new Good();
new AlsoGood();
new Bad(); // ReferenceError: Must call super constructor in derived class before accessing 'this' or returning from derived constructor
```

### Global context

In the global execution context (outside of any functions or classes; may be inside [blocks](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/block) or [arrow functions](#arrow_functions) defined in the global scope), the `this` value depends on what execution context the script runs in. Like [callbacks](#callbacks), the `this` value is determined by the runtime environment (the caller).

At the top level of a script, `this` refers to {{jsxref("globalThis")}} whether in strict mode or not. This is generally the same as the global object — for example, if the source is put inside an HTML [`<script>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script) element and executed as a script, `this === window`.

> **Note:** `globalThis` is generally the same concept as the global object (i.e. adding properties to `globalThis` makes them global variables) — this is the case for browsers and Node — but hosts are allowed to provide a different value for `globalThis` that's unrelated to the global object.

```js
// In web browsers, the window object is also the global object:
console.log(this === window); // true

this.b = "MDN";
console.log(window.b); // "MDN"
console.log(b); // "MDN"
```

If the source is loaded as a [module](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) (for HTML, this means adding `type="module"` to the `<script>` tag), `this` is always `undefined` at the top level.

If the source is executed with [`eval()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval), `this` is the same as the enclosing context for [direct eval](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval#direct_and_indirect_eval), or `globalThis` (as if it's run in a separate global script) for indirect eval.

```js
function test() {
  // Direct eval
  console.log(eval("this") === this);
  // Indirect eval, non-strict
  console.log(eval?.("this") === globalThis);
  // Indirect eval, strict
  console.log(eval?.("'use strict'; this") === globalThis);
}

test.call({ name: "obj" }); // Logs 3 "true"
```

Note that some source code, while looking like the global scope, is actually wrapped in a function when executed. For example, Node.js CommonJS modules are wrapped in a function and executed with the `this` value set to `module.exports`. [Event handler attributes](#this_in_inline_event_handlers) are executed with `this` set to the element they are attached to.

Object literals don't create a `this` scope — only functions (methods) defined within the object do. Using `this` in an object literal inherits the value from the surrounding scope.

```js
const obj = {
  a: this,
};

console.log(obj.a === window); // true
```

## Examples

### this in function contexts

The value of `this` depends on how the function is called, not how it's defined.

```js
// An object can be passed as the first argument to call
// or apply and this will be bound to it.
const obj = { a: "Custom" };

// Variables declared with var become properties of the global object.
var a = "Global";

function whatsThis() {
  return this.a; // The value of this is dependent on how the function is called
}

whatsThis(); // 'Global'; this in the function isn't set, so it defaults to the global/window object in non–strict mode
obj.whatsThis = whatsThis;
obj.whatsThis(); // 'Custom'; this in the function is set to obj
```

Using `call()` and `apply()`, you can pass the value of `this` as if it's an actual parameter.

```js
function add(c, d) {
  return this.a + this.b + c + d;
}

const o = { a: 1, b: 3 };

// The first parameter is the object to use as 'this'; subsequent
// parameters are used as arguments in the function call
add.call(o, 5, 7); // 16

// The first parameter is the object to use as 'this', the second is an
// array whose members are used as arguments in the function call
add.apply(o, [10, 20]); // 34
```

### this and object conversion

In non–strict mode, if a function is called with a `this` value that's not an object, the `this` value is substituted with an object. `null` and `undefined` become `globalThis`. Primitives like `7` or `'foo'` are converted to an object using the related constructor, so the primitive number `7` is converted to a {{jsxref("Number")}} wrapper class and the string `'foo'` to a {{jsxref("String")}} wrapper class.

```js
function bar() {
  console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(this));
}

bar.call(7); // [object Number]
bar.call("foo"); // [object String]
bar.call(undefined); // [object Window]
```

### The bind() method

Calling [`f.bind(someObject)`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind) creates a new function with the same body and scope as `f`, but the value of `this` is permanently bound to the first argument of `bind`, regardless of how the function is being called.

```js
function f() {
  return this.a;
}

const g = f.bind({ a: "azerty" });
console.log(g()); // azerty

const h = g.bind({ a: "yoo" }); // bind only works once!
console.log(h()); // azerty

const o = { a: 37, f, g, h };
console.log(o.a, o.f(), o.g(), o.h()); // 37,37, azerty, azerty
```

### this in arrow functions

Arrow functions create closures over the `this` value of the enclosing execution context. In the following example, we create `obj` with a method `getThisGetter` that returns a function that returns the value of `this`. The returned function is created as an arrow function, so its `this` is permanently bound to the `this` of its enclosing function. The value of `this` inside `getThisGetter` can be set in the call, which in turn sets the return value of the returned function.

```js
const obj = {
  getThisGetter() {
    const getter = () => this;
    return getter;
  },
};
```

We can call `getThisGetter` as a method of `obj`, which sets `this` inside the body to `obj`. The returned function is assigned to a variable `fn`. Now, when calling `fn`, the value of `this` returned is still the one set by the call to `getThisGetter`, which is `obj`. If the returned function is not an arrow function, such calls would cause the `this` value to be `globalThis` or `undefined` in strict mode.

```js
const fn = obj.getThisGetter();
console.log(fn() === obj); // true
```

But be careful if you unbind the method of `obj` without calling it, because `getThisGetter` is still a method that has a varying `this` value. Calling `fn2()()` in the following example returns `globalThis`, because it follows the `this` from `fn2`, which is `globalThis` since it's called without being attached to any object.

```js
const fn2 = obj.getThisGetter;
console.log(fn2()() === globalThis); // true
```

This behavior is very useful when defining callbacks. Usually, each function expression creates its own `this` binding, which shadows the `this` value of the upper scope. Now, you can define functions as arrow functions if you don't care about the `this` value, and only create `this` bindings where you do (e.g. in class methods). See [example with `setTimeout()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#using_call_bind_and_apply).

### this with a getter or setter

`this` in getters and setters is based on which object the property is accessed on, not which object the property is defined on. A function used as getter or setter has its `this` bound to the object from which the property is being set or gotten.

```js
function sum() {
  return this.a + this.b + this.c;
}

const o = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  c: 3,
  get average() {
    return (this.a + this.b + this.c) / 3;
  },
};

Object.defineProperty(o, "sum", {
  get: sum,
  enumerable: true,
  configurable: true,
});

console.log(o.average, o.sum); // 2, 6
```

### As a DOM event handler

When a function is used as an event handler, its `this` is set to the element on which the listener is placed (some browsers do not follow this convention for listeners added dynamically with methods other than {{domxref("EventTarget/addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}}).

```js
// When called as a listener, turns the related element blue
function bluify(e) {
  // Always true
  console.log(this === e.currentTarget);
  // true when currentTarget and target are the same object
  console.log(this === e.target);
  this.style.backgroundColor = "#A5D9F3";
}

// Get a list of every element in the document
const elements = document.getElementsByTagName("*");

// Add bluify as a click listener so when the
// element is clicked on, it turns blue
for (const element of elements) {
  element.addEventListener("click", bluify, false);
}
```

### this in inline event handlers

When the code is called from an inline [event handler attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes#event_handler_attributes), its `this` is set to the DOM element on which the listener is placed:

```html
<button onclick="alert(this.tagName.toLowerCase());">Show this</button>
```

The above alert shows `button`. Note, however, that only the outer code has its `this` set this way:

```html
<button onclick="alert((function () { return this; })());">
  Show inner this
</button>
```

In this case, the inner function's `this` isn't set, so it returns the global/window object (i.e. the default object in non–strict mode where `this` isn't set by the call).

### Bound methods in classes

Just like with regular functions, the value of `this` within methods depends on how they are called. Sometimes it is useful to override this behavior so that `this` within classes always refers to the class instance. To achieve this, bind the class methods in the constructor:

```js
class Car {
  constructor() {
    // Bind sayBye but not sayHi to show the difference
    this.sayBye = this.sayBye.bind(this);
  }
  sayHi() {
    console.log(`Hello from ${this.name}`);
  }
  sayBye() {
    console.log(`Bye from ${this.name}`);
  }
  get name() {
    return "Ferrari";
  }
}

class Bird {
  get name() {
    return "Tweety";
  }
}

const car = new Car();
const bird = new Bird();

// The value of 'this' in methods depends on their caller
car.sayHi(); // Hello from Ferrari
bird.sayHi = car.sayHi;
bird.sayHi(); // Hello from Tweety

// For bound methods, 'this' doesn't depend on the caller
bird.sayBye = car.sayBye;
bird.sayBye(); // Bye from Ferrari
```

> **Note:** Classes are always in strict mode. Calling methods with an undefined `this` will throw an error if the method tries to access properties on `this`.

Note, however, that auto-bound methods suffer from the same problem as [using arrow functions for class properties](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions#cannot_be_used_as_methods): each instance of the class will have its own copy of the method, which increases memory usage. Only use it where absolutely necessary. You can also mimic the implementation of [`Intl.NumberFormat.prototype.format()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/format#using_format_with_map): define the property as a getter that returns a bound function when accessed and saves it, so that the function is only created once and only created when necessary.

### this in with statements

Although [`with`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/with) statements are deprecated and not available in strict mode, they still serve as an exception to the normal `this` binding rules. If a function is called within a `with` statement and that function is a property of the scope object, the `this` value is set to the scope object, as if the `obj1.` prefix exists.

```js
const obj1 = {
  foo() {
    return this;
  },
};

with (obj1) {
  console.log(foo() === obj1); // true
}
```
