{{jsSidebar("Operators")}}

A **function's `this` keyword** behaves a little differently in
JavaScript compared to other languages. It also has some differences between [strict mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode) and non-strict
mode.

In most cases, the value of `this` is determined by how a function is called
(runtime binding). It can't be set by assignment during execution, and it may be
different each time the function is called. ES5 introduced the
{{jsxref("Function.prototype.bind()", "bind()")}} method to {{jsxref('Operators/this',
  "set the value of a function's <code>this</code> regardless of how it's called",
  'The_bind_method', 1)}}, and ES2015 introduced [arrow
functions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) which don't provide their own `this` binding (it retains the
`this` value of the enclosing lexical context).

## Syntax

```js
this
```

### Value

A property of an execution context (global, function or eval) that, in non–strict mode,
is always a reference to an object and in strict mode can be any value.

## Description

### Global context

In the global execution context (outside of any function), `this` refers to
the global object whether in strict mode or not.

```js
// In web browsers, the window object is also the global object:
console.log(this === window); // true

a = 37;
console.log(window.a); // 37

this.b = "MDN";
console.log(window.b)  // "MDN"
console.log(b)         // "MDN"
```

> **Note:** You can always easily get the global object using the global
> {{jsxref("globalThis")}} property, regardless of the current context in which your
> code is running.

### Function context

Inside a function, the value of `this` depends on how the function is
called.

Since the following code is not in [strict mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode), and because
the value of `this` is not set by the call, `this` will default to
the global object, which is {{domxref("Window", "window")}} in a browser.

```js
function f1() {
  return this;
}

// In a browser:
f1() === window; // true

// In Node:
f1() === globalThis; // true
```

In strict mode, however, if the value of `this` is not set when entering an
execution context, it remains as `undefined`, as shown in the following
example:

```js
function f2() {
  'use strict'; // see strict mode
  return this;
}

f2() === undefined; // true
```

> **Note:** In the second example, `this` should be
> {{jsxref("undefined")}}, because `f2` was called directly and not as a method
> or property of an object (e.g. `window.f2()`). This feature wasn't
> implemented in some browsers when they first started to support [strict mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode). As a result,
> they incorrectly returned the `window` object.

To set the value of `this` to a particular value when calling a function,
use {{jsxref("Function.prototype.call()", "call()")}}, or
{{jsxref("Function.prototype.apply()", "apply()")}} as in the examples below.

### Class context

The behavior of `this` in [classes](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) and functions is
similar, since classes are functions under the hood. But there are some differences and
caveats.

Within a class constructor, `this` is a regular object. All non-static
methods within the class are added to the prototype of `this`:

```js
class Example {
  constructor() {
    const proto = Object.getPrototypeOf(this);
    console.log(Object.getOwnPropertyNames(proto));
  }
  first(){}
  second(){}
  static third(){}
}

new Example(); // ['constructor', 'first', 'second']
```

> **Note:** Static methods are not properties of `this`. They
> are properties of the class itself.

### Derived classes

Unlike base class constructors, derived constructors have no initial `this`
binding. Calling  {{jsxref("Operators/super", "super()")}} creates a `this`
binding within the constructor and essentially has the effect of evaluating the
following line of code, where Base is the inherited class:

```js
this = new Base();
```

> **Warning:** Referring to `this` before calling
> `super()` will throw an error.

Derived classes must not return before calling `super()`, unless they return
an `Object` or have no constructor at all.

```js
class Base {}
class Good extends Base {}
class AlsoGood extends Base {
  constructor() {
    return {a: 5};
  }
}
class Bad extends Base {
  constructor() {}
}

new Good();
new AlsoGood();
new Bad(); // ReferenceError
```

## Examples

### this in function contexts

```js
// An object can be passed as the first argument to call or apply and this will be bound to it.
var obj = {a: 'Custom'};

// We declare a variable and the variable is assigned to the global window as its property.
var a = 'Global';

function whatsThis() {
  return this.a;  // The value of this is dependent on how the function is called
}

whatsThis();          // 'Global' as this in the function isn't set, so it defaults to the global/window object
whatsThis.call(obj);  // 'Custom' as this in the function is set to obj
whatsThis.apply(obj); // 'Custom' as this in the function is set to obj
```

### this and object conversion

```js
function add(c, d) {
  return this.a + this.b + c + d;
}

var o = {a: 1, b: 3};

// The first parameter is the object to use as
// 'this', subsequent parameters are passed as
// arguments in the function call
add.call(o, 5, 7); // 16

// The first parameter is the object to use as
// 'this', the second is an array whose
// members are used as the arguments in the function call
add.apply(o, [10, 20]); // 34
```

Note that in non–strict mode, with `call` and `apply`, if the
value passed as `this` is not an object, an attempt will be made to convert
it to an object. Values `null` and `undefined` become the global
object. Primitives like `7` or `'foo'` will be converted to an
Object using the related constructor, so the primitive number `7` is
converted to an object as if by `new Number(7)` and the string
`'foo'` to an object as if by `new String('foo')`, e.g.

```js
function bar() {
  console.log(Object.prototype.toString.call(this));
}

bar.call(7);     // [object Number]
bar.call('foo'); // [object String]
bar.call(undefined); // [object global]
```

### The `bind` method

ECMAScript 5 introduced {{jsxref("Function.prototype.bind()")}}. Calling
`f.bind(someObject)` creates a new function with the same body and scope as
`f`, but where `this` occurs in the original function, in the new
function it is permanently bound to the first argument of `bind`, regardless
of how the function is being used.

```js
function f() {
  return this.a;
}

var g = f.bind({a: 'azerty'});
console.log(g()); // azerty

var h = g.bind({a: 'yoo'}); // bind only works once!
console.log(h()); // azerty

var o = {a: 37, f: f, g: g, h: h};
console.log(o.a, o.f(), o.g(), o.h()); // 37,37, azerty, azerty
```

### Arrow functions

In [arrow
functions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions), `this` retains the value of the enclosing lexical context's
`this`. In global code, it will be set to the global object:

```js
var globalObject = this;
var foo = (() => this);
console.log(foo() === globalObject); // true
```

> **Note:** If `this` arg is passed to `call`, `bind`, or
> `apply` on invocation of an arrow function it will be ignored. You can
> still prepend arguments to the call, but the first argument (`thisArg`)
> should be set to `null`.

```js
// Call as a method of an object
var obj = {func: foo};
console.log(obj.func() === globalObject); // true

// Attempt to set this using call
console.log(foo.call(obj) === globalObject); // true

// Attempt to set this using bind
foo = foo.bind(obj);
console.log(foo() === globalObject); // true
```

No matter what, `foo`'s `this` is set to what it was when it was
created (in the example above, the global object). The same applies to arrow functions
created inside other functions: their `this` remains that of the enclosing
lexical context.

```js
// Create obj with a method bar that returns a function that
// returns its this. The returned function is created as
// an arrow function, so its this is permanently bound to the
// this of its enclosing function. The value of bar can be set
// in the call, which in turn sets the value of the
// returned function.
var obj = {
  bar: function() {
    var x = (() => this);
    return x;
  }
};

// Call bar as a method of obj, setting its this to obj
// Assign a reference to the returned function to fn
var fn = obj.bar();

// Call fn without setting this, would normally default
// to the global object or undefined in strict mode
console.log(fn() === obj); // true

// But caution if you reference the method of obj without calling it
var fn2 = obj.bar;
// Calling the arrow function's this from inside the bar method()
// will now return window, because it follows the this from fn2.
console.log(fn2()() == window); // true
```

In the above, the function (call it anonymous function A) assigned to
`obj.bar` returns another function (call it anonymous function B) that is
created as an arrow function. As a result, function B's `this` is permanently
set to the `this` of `obj.bar` (function A) when called. When the
returned function (function B) is called, its `this` will always be what it
was set to initially. In the above code example, function B's `this` is set
to function A's `this` which is `obj`, so it remains set to
`obj` even when called in a manner that would normally set its
`this` to `undefined` or the global object (or any other method as
in the previous example in the global execution context).

### As an object method

When a function is called as a method of an object, its `this` is set to the
object the method is called on.

In the following example, when `o.f()` is invoked, inside the function
`this` is bound to the `o` object.

```js
var o = {
  prop: 37,
  f: function() {
    return this.prop;
  }
};

console.log(o.f()); // 37
```

Note that this behavior is not at all affected by how or where the function was
defined. In the previous example, we defined the function inline as the `f`
member during the definition of `o`. However, we could have just as easily
defined the function first and later attached it to `o.f`. Doing so results
in the same behavior:

```js
var o = {prop: 37};

function independent() {
  return this.prop;
}

o.f = independent;

console.log(o.f()); // 37
```

This demonstrates that it matters only that the function was invoked from the
`f` member of `o`.

Similarly, the `this` binding is only affected by the most immediate member
reference. In the following example, when we invoke the function, we call it as a method
`g` of the object `o.b`. This time during execution,
`this` inside the function will refer to `o.b`. The fact that the
object is itself a member of `o` has no consequence; the most immediate
reference is all that matters.

```js
o.b = {g: independent, prop: 42};
console.log(o.b.g()); // 42
```

#### `this` on the object's prototype chain

The same notion holds true for methods defined somewhere on the object's prototype
chain. If the method is on an object's prototype chain, `this` refers to the
object the method was called on, as if the method were on the object.

```js
var o = {f: function() { return this.a + this.b; }};
var p = Object.create(o);
p.a = 1;
p.b = 4;

console.log(p.f()); // 5
```

In this example, the object assigned to the variable `p` doesn't have its
own `f` property, it inherits it from its prototype. But it doesn't matter
that the lookup for `f` eventually finds a member with that name on
`o`; the lookup began as a reference to `p.f`, so
`this` inside the function takes the value of the object referred to as
`p`. That is, since `f` is called as a method of `p`,
its `this` refers to `p`. This is an interesting feature of
JavaScript's prototype inheritance.

#### `this` with a getter or setter

Again, the same notion holds true when a function is invoked from a getter or a setter.
A function used as getter or setter has its `this` bound to the object from
which the property is being set or gotten.

```js
function sum() {
  return this.a + this.b + this.c;
}

var o = {
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  c: 3,
  get average() {
    return (this.a + this.b + this.c) / 3;
  }
};

Object.defineProperty(o, 'sum', {
    get: sum, enumerable: true, configurable: true});

console.log(o.average, o.sum); // 2, 6
```

### As a constructor

When a function is used as a constructor (with the {{jsxref("Operators/new", "new")}}
keyword), its `this` is bound to the new object being constructed.

> **Note:** While the default for a constructor is to return the object referenced by
> `this`, it can instead return some other object (if the return value isn't
> an object, then the `this` object is returned).

```js
/*
 * Constructors work like this:
 *
 * function MyConstructor(){
 *   // Actual function body code goes here.
 *   // Create properties on |this| as
 *   // desired by assigning to them.  E.g.,
 *   this.fum = "nom";
 *   // et cetera...
 *
 *   // If the function has a return statement that
 *   // returns an object, that object will be the
 *   // result of the |new| expression.  Otherwise,
 *   // the result of the expression is the object
 *   // currently bound to |this|
 *   // (i.e., the common case most usually seen).
 * }
 */

function C() {
  this.a = 37;
}

var o = new C();
console.log(o.a); // 37

function C2() {
  this.a = 37;
  return {a: 38};
}

o = new C2();
console.log(o.a); // 38
```

In the last example (`C2`), because an object was returned during
construction, the new object that `this` was bound to gets discarded. (This
essentially makes the statement "`this.a = 37;`" dead code. It's not exactly
dead because it gets executed, but it can be eliminated with no outside effects.)

### As a DOM event handler

When a function is used as an event handler, its `this` is set to the
element on which the listener is placed (some browsers do not follow this convention for
listeners added dynamically with methods other than
{{domxref("EventTarget/addEventListener", "addEventListener()")}}).

```js
// When called as a listener, turns the related element blue
function bluify(e) {
  // Always true
  console.log(this === e.currentTarget);
  // true when currentTarget and target are the same object
  console.log(this === e.target);
  this.style.backgroundColor = '#A5D9F3';
}

// Get a list of every element in the document
var elements = document.getElementsByTagName('*');

// Add bluify as a click listener so when the
// element is clicked on, it turns blue
for (var i = 0; i < elements.length; i++) {
  elements[i].addEventListener('click', bluify, false);
}
```

### In an inline event handler

When the code is called from an inline [on-event handler](/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Event_handlers), its
`this` is set to the DOM element on which the listener is placed:

```html
<button onclick="alert(this.tagName.toLowerCase());">
  Show this
</button>
```

The above alert shows `button`. Note however that only the outer code has
its `this` set this way:

```html
<button onclick="alert((function() { return this; })());">
  Show inner this
</button>
```

In this case, the inner function's `this` isn't set so it returns the
global/window object (i.e. the default object in non–strict mode where `this`
isn't set by the call).

### this in classes

Just like with regular functions, the value of `this` within methods depends
on how they are called. Sometimes it is useful to override this behavior so that
`this` within classes always refers to the class instance. To achieve this,
bind the class methods in the constructor:

```js
class Car {
  constructor() {
    // Bind sayBye but not sayHi to show the difference
    this.sayBye = this.sayBye.bind(this);
  }
  sayHi() {
    console.log(`Hello from ${this.name}`);
  }
  sayBye() {
    console.log(`Bye from ${this.name}`);
  }
  get name() {
    return 'Ferrari';
  }
}

class Bird {
  get name() {
    return 'Tweety';
  }
}

const car = new Car();
const bird = new Bird();

// The value of 'this' in methods depends on their caller
car.sayHi(); // Hello from Ferrari
bird.sayHi = car.sayHi;
bird.sayHi(); // Hello from Tweety

// For bound methods, 'this' doesn't depend on the caller
bird.sayBye = car.sayBye;
bird.sayBye();  // Bye from Ferrari
```

> **Note:** Classes are always strict mode code. Calling methods with an
> undefined `this` will throw an error.
