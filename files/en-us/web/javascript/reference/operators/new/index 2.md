{{jsSidebar("Operators")}}

The **`new` operator** lets developers
create an instance of a user-defined object type or of one of the built-in object
types that has a constructor function.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/js/expressions-newoperator.html")}}

## Syntax

```js
new constructor[([arguments])]
```

### Parameters

- `constructor`
  - : A class or function that specifies the type of the object instance.
- `arguments`
  - : A list of values that the `constructor` will be called with.

## Description

The **`new`** keyword does the following things:

1.  Creates a blank, plain JavaScript object.
2.  Adds a property to the new object (`__proto__`) that links to the constructor function's prototype object

    > **Note:** Properties/objects added to the construction function prototype are therefore accessible to all instances created from the constructor function (using `new`).

3.  Binds the newly created object instance as the `this` context
    (i.e. all references to `this` in the constructor function now refer to the object created in the first step).
4.  Returns `this` if the function doesn't return an object.

Creating a user-defined object requires two steps:

1.  Define the object type by writing a function that specifies its name and properties.
    For example, a constructor function to create an object `Foo`might look like this:

    ```js
    function Foo(bar1, bar2) {
      this.bar1 = bar1;
      this.bar2 = bar2;
    }
    ```

2.  Create an instance of the object with `new`.

    ```js
    var myFoo = new Foo('Bar 1', 2021);
    ```

> **Note:** An object can have a property that is itself another object. See the
> examples below.

When the code `new Foo(...)` is executed, the following things
happen:

1.  A new object is created, inheriting from `Foo.prototype`.
2.  The constructor function `Foo` is called with the specified
    arguments, and with
    [`this`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
    bound to the newly created object. `new Foo` is equivalent to
    `new Foo()`, i.e. if no argument list is specified,
    `Foo` is called without arguments.
3.  The object (not null, false, 3.1415 or other primitive types) returned by the
    constructor function becomes the result of the whole `new` expression. If
    the constructor function doesn't explicitly return an object, the object created in
    step 1 is used instead (normally constructors don't return a value, but they can
    choose to do so if they want to override the normal object creation process).

You can always add a property to a previously defined object instance. For example, the
statement `car1.color = "black"` adds a property `color` to
`car1`, and assigns it a value of "`black`".

However, this does not affect any other objects. To add the new property to all objects of the same type,
you must add the property to the definition of the `Car` object type.

You can add a shared property to a previously defined object type by using the
[`Function.prototype`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function)
property. This defines a property that is shared by all objects created with that
function, rather than by just one instance of the object type. The following code adds a
color property with value `"original color"` to all objects of type
`Car`, and then overwrites that value with the string "`black`"
only in the instance object `car1`. For more information, see [prototype](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_prototypes).

```js
function Car() {}
car1 = new Car();
car2 = new Car();

console.log(car1.color);    // undefined

Car.prototype.color = 'original color';
console.log(car1.color);    // 'original color'

car1.color = 'black';
console.log(car1.color);    // 'black'

console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(car1).color); // 'original color'
console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(car2).color); // 'original color'
console.log(car1.color);   // 'black'
console.log(car2.color);   // 'original color'
```

> **Note:** While the constructor function can be invoked like any regular function (i.e. without the `new` operator),
> in this case a new Object is not created and the value of `this` is also different.

## Examples

### Object type and object instance

Suppose you want to create an object type for cars. You want this type of object to be
called `Car`, and you want it to have properties for make, model, and year.
To do this, you would write the following function:

```js
function Car(make, model, year) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
}
```

Now you can create an object called `myCar` as follows:

```js
var myCar = new Car('Eagle', 'Talon TSi', 1993);
```

This statement creates `myCar` and assigns it the specified values for its
properties. Then the value of `myCar.make` is the string "Eagle",
`myCar.year` is the integer 1993, and so on.

You can create any number of `car` objects by calls to `new`. For
example:

```js
var kensCar = new Car('Nissan', '300ZX', 1992);
```

### Object property that is itself another object

Suppose you define an object called `Person` as follows:

```js
function Person(name, age, sex) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.sex = sex;
}
```

And then instantiate two new `Person` objects as follows:

```js
var rand = new Person('Rand McNally', 33, 'M');
var ken = new Person('Ken Jones', 39, 'M');
```

Then you can rewrite the definition of `Car` to include an
`owner` property that takes a `Person` object, as follows:

```js
function Car(make, model, year, owner) {
  this.make = make;
  this.model = model;
  this.year = year;
  this.owner = owner;
}
```

To instantiate the new objects, you then use the following:

```js
var car1 = new Car('Eagle', 'Talon TSi', 1993, rand);
var car2 = new Car('Nissan', '300ZX', 1992, ken);
```

Instead of passing a literal string or integer value when creating the new objects, the
above statements pass the objects `rand` and `ken` as the
parameters for the owners. To find out the name of the owner of `car2`, you
can access the following property:

```js
car2.owner.name
```
