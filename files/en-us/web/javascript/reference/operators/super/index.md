{{jsSidebar("Operators")}}

The **super** keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's
parent.

The `super.prop` and `super[expr]` expressions are valid in any
[method
definition](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions) in both [classes](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) and [object
literals](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer).

## Syntax

```js
super([arguments]); // calls the parent constructor.
super.functionOnParent([arguments]);
```

## Description

When used in a constructor, the `super` keyword appears alone and must be
used before the `this` keyword is used. The `super` keyword can
also be used to call functions on a parent object.

## Examples

### Using `super` in classes

This code snippet is taken from the [classes
sample](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/samples/blob/gh-pages/classes-es6/index.html) ([live demo](https://googlechrome.github.io/samples/classes-es6/index.html)).
Here `super()` is called to avoid duplicating the constructor parts' that are
common between `Rectangle` and `Square`.

```js
class Rectangle {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.name = "Rectangle";
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
  sayName() {
    console.log("Hi, I am a ", this.name + ".");
  }
  get area() {
    return this.height * this.width;
  }
  set area(value) {
    this._area = value;
  }
}

class Square extends Rectangle {
  constructor(length) {
    this.height; // ReferenceError, super needs to be called first!

    // Here, it calls the parent class's constructor with lengths
    // provided for the Rectangle's width and height
    super(length, length);

    // Note: In derived classes, super() must be called before you
    // can use 'this'. Leaving this out will cause a reference error.
    this.name = "Square";
  }
}
```

### Super-calling static methods

You are also able to call super on [static](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/static) methods.

```js
class Rectangle {
  static logNbSides() {
    return "I have 4 sides";
  }
}

class Square extends Rectangle {
  static logDescription() {
    return super.logNbSides() + " which are all equal";
  }
}
Square.logDescription(); // 'I have 4 sides which are all equal'
```

### Deleting super properties will throw an error

You cannot use the [delete operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/delete) and
`super.prop` or `super[expr]` to delete a parent class' property,
it will throw a {{jsxref("ReferenceError")}}.

```js
class Base {
  foo() {}
}
class Derived extends Base {
  delete() {
    delete super.foo; // this is bad
  }
}

new Derived().delete(); // ReferenceError: invalid delete involving 'super'.
```

### `super.prop` cannot overwrite non-writable properties

When defining non-writable properties with e.g. {{jsxref("Object.defineProperty")}},
`super` cannot overwrite the value of the property.

```js
class X {
  constructor() {
    Object.defineProperty(this, "prop", {
      configurable: true,
      writable: false,
      value: 1,
    });
  }
}

class Y extends X {
  constructor() {
    super();
  }
  foo() {
    super.prop = 2; // Cannot overwrite the value.
  }
}

var y = new Y();
y.foo(); // TypeError: "prop" is read-only
console.log(y.prop); // 1
```

### Using `super.prop` in object literals

Super can also be used in the [object
initializer / literal](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer) notation. In this example, two objects define a method. In
the second object, `super` calls the first object's method. This works with
the help of {{jsxref("Object.setPrototypeOf()")}} with which we are able to set the
prototype of `obj2` to `obj1`, so that `super` is able
to find `method1` on `obj1`.

```js
var obj1 = {
  method1() {
    console.log("method 1");
  },
};

var obj2 = {
  method2() {
    super.method1();
  },
};

Object.setPrototypeOf(obj2, obj1);
obj2.method2(); // logs "method 1"
```
