A **non-capturing group** groups a subpattern, allowing you to apply a [quantifier](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Quantifier) to the entire group or use [disjunctions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Disjunction) within it. It acts like the [grouping operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Grouping) in JavaScript expressions, and unlike [capturing groups](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Capturing_group), it does not memorize the matched text, allowing for better performance and avoiding confusion when the pattern also contains useful capturing groups.

## Syntax

```regex
(?:pattern)
```

### Parameters

- `pattern`
  - : A pattern consisting of anything you may use in a regex literal, including a [disjunction](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Disjunction).

## Examples

### Grouping a subpattern and applying a quantifier

In the following example, we test if a file path ends with `styles.css` or `styles.[a hex hash].css`. Because the entire `\.[\da-f]+` part is optional, in order to apply the `?` quantifier to it, we need to group it into a new atom. Using a non-capturing group improves performance by not creating the extra match information that we don't need.

```js
function isStylesheet(path) {
  return /styles(?:\.[\da-f]+)?\.css$/.test(path);
}

isStylesheet("styles.css"); // true
isStylesheet("styles.1234.css"); // true
isStylesheet("styles.cafe.css"); // true
isStylesheet("styles.1234.min.css"); // false
```

### Grouping a disjunction

A disjunction has the lowest precedence in a regular expression. If you want to use a disjunction as a part of a bigger pattern, you must group it. You are advised to use a non-capturing group unless you rely on the matched text of the disjunction. The following example matches file extensions, using the same code as the [input boundary assertion](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Input_boundary_assertion#matching_file_extensions) article:

```js
function isImage(filename) {
  return /\.(?:png|jpe?g|webp|avif|gif)$/i.test(filename);
}

isImage("image.png"); // true
isImage("image.jpg"); // true
isImage("image.pdf"); // false
```

### Avoiding refactoring hazards

Capturing groups are accessed by their position in the pattern. If you add or remove a capturing group, you must also update the positions of the other capturing groups, if you are accessing them through match results or [backreferences](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Backreference). This can be a source of bugs, especially if most groups are purely for syntactic purposes (to apply quantifiers or to group disjunctions). Using non-capturing groups avoids this problem, and allows the indices of actual capturing groups to be easily tracked.

For example, suppose we have a function that matches the `title='xxx'` pattern in a string (example taken from [capturing group](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Capturing_group#pairing_quotes)). To ensure the quotes match, we use a backreference to refer to the first quote.

```js
function parseTitle(metastring) {
  return metastring.match(/title=(["'])(.*?)\1/)[2];
}

parseTitle('title="foo"'); // 'foo'
```

If we later decided to add `name='xxx'` as an alias for `title=`, we will need to group the disjunction in another group:

```js example-bad
function parseTitle(metastring) {
  // Oops â€” the backreference and index access are now off by one!
  return metastring.match(/(title|name)=(["'])(.*?)\1/)[2];
}

parseTitle('name="foo"'); // Cannot read properties of null (reading '2')
// Because \1 now refers to the "name" string, which isn't found at the end.
```

Instead of locating all places where we are referring to the capturing groups' indices and updating them one-by-one, it's better to avoid using a capturing group:

```js example-good
function parseTitle(metastring) {
  // Do not capture the title|name disjunction
  // because we don't use its value
  return metastring.match(/(?:title|name)=(["'])(.*?)\1/)[2];
}

parseTitle('name="foo"'); // 'foo'
```

[Named capturing groups](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Regular_expressions/Named_capturing_group) are another way to avoid refactoring hazards. It allows capturing groups to accessed by a custom name, which is unaffected when other capturing groups are added or removed.
