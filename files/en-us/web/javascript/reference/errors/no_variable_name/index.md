{{jsSidebar("Errors")}}

The JavaScript exception "missing variable name" is a common error.
It is usually caused by omitting a variable name or a typographic error.

## Message

```
SyntaxError: missing variable name (Firefox)
SyntaxError: Unexpected token '='. Expected a parameter pattern or a ')' in parameter list. (Safari)
```

## Error type

{{jsxref("SyntaxError")}}

## What went wrong?

A variable is missing a name. The cause is most likely a typo or a forgotten variable name.
Make sure that you've provided the name of the variable before the `=` sign.

When declaring multiple variables at the same time, make sure that the previous lines/declaration does not end with a comma instead of a semicolon.

## Examples

### Missing a variable name

```js example-bad
const = "foo";
```

It is easy to forget to assign a name for your variable!

```js example-good
const description = "foo";
```

### Reserved keywords can't be variable names

There are a few variable names that are [reserved keywords](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#keywords).
You can't use these. Sorry :(

```js example-bad
const debugger = "whoop";
// SyntaxError: missing variable name
```

### Declaring multiple variables

Pay special attention to commas when declaring multiple variables.
Is there an excess comma, or did you use commas instead of semicolons?
Did you remember to assign values for all your `const` variables?

```js example-bad
let x, y = "foo",
const z, = "foo"

const first = document.getElementById("one"),
const second = document.getElementById("two"),

// SyntaxError: missing variable name
```

The fixed version:

```js example-good
let x,
  y = "foo";
const z = "foo";

const first = document.getElementById("one");
const second = document.getElementById("two");
```

### Arrays

{{jsxref("Array")}} literals in JavaScript need square brackets around the values.
This won't work:

```js example-bad
const arr = 1,2,3,4,5;
// SyntaxError: missing variable name
```

This would be correct:

```js example-good
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```
