{{jsSidebar("Errors")}}

The JavaScript [strict mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode)-only exception
"for-in loop head declarations may not have initializers"
occurs when the head of a [for...in](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) contains
an initializer expression, such as `for (var i = 0 in obj)`. This is not
allowed in for-in loops in strict mode. In addition, lexical declarations with initializers like `for (const i = 0 in obj)` are not allowed outside strict mode either.

## Message

```
SyntaxError: for-in loop variable declaration may not have an initializer. (V8-based)
SyntaxError: for-in loop head declarations may not have initializers (Firefox)
SyntaxError: a lexical declaration in the head of a for-in loop can't have an initializer (Firefox)
SyntaxError: Cannot assign to the loop variable inside a for-in loop header. (Safari)
```

## Error type

{{jsxref("SyntaxError")}}.

## What went wrong?

The head of a [for...in](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) loop contains an initializer expression.
That is, a variable is declared and assigned a value `for (var i = 0 in obj)`.
In non-strict mode, this head declaration is silently ignored and behaves like `for (var i in obj)`.
In [strict mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode), however, a `SyntaxError` is thrown. In addition, lexical declarations with initializers like `for (const i = 0 in obj)` are not allowed outside strict mode either, and will always produce a `SyntaxError`.

## Examples

This example throws a `SyntaxError`:

```js example-bad
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };

for (const i = 0 in obj) {
  console.log(obj[i]);
}

// SyntaxError: for-in loop head declarations may not have initializers
```

### Valid for-in loop

You can remove the initializer (`i = 0`) in the head of the for-in loop.

```js example-good
const obj = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 };

for (const i in obj) {
  console.log(obj[i]);
}
```

### Array iteration

The for...in loop [shouldn't be used for Array iteration](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in#array_iteration_and_for...in).
Did you intend to use a [`for`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for) loop
instead of a `for-in` loop to iterate an {{jsxref("Array")}}? The
`for` loop allows you to set an initializer then as well:

```js example-good
const arr = ["a", "b", "c"];

for (let i = 2; i < arr.length; i++) {
  console.log(arr[i]);
}

// "c"
```

  – also disallows an initializer in both strict and non-strict mode.
- [`for`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for) –
  preferred for array iteration, allows to define an initializer.
