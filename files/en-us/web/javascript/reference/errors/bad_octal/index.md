The JavaScript warning "08 (or 09) is not a legal ECMA-262 octal constant" occurs when
`08` or `09` number literals are used. They can't be interpreted
as an octal number.

## Message

```
Warning: SyntaxError: 08 is not a legal ECMA-262 octal constant.
```

## Error type

Warning. JavaScript execution won't be halted.

## What went wrong?

Decimal literals can start with a zero (`0`) followed by another decimal
digit, but If all digits after the leading `0` are smaller than 8, the number
is interpreted as an octal number. Because this is not the case with `08` and
`09`, JavaScript warns about it.

Note that octal literals and octal escape sequences are deprecated and will present an
additional deprecation warning. The standardized syntax for octal literals uses a leading
zero followed by a lowercase or uppercase Latin letter "O" (`0o` or
`0O)`. See the page about [lexical grammar](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#octal)
for more information.

## Examples

### Invalid octal numbers

```js example-bad
08;
09;
// SyntaxError: 08 is not a legal ECMA-262 octal constant
// SyntaxError: "0"-prefixed octal literals and octal escape sequences
// are deprecated
```

### Valid octal numbers

Use a leading zero followed by the letter "o";

```js-nolint example-good
0O755;
0o644;
```
