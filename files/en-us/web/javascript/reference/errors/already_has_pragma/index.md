{{jsSidebar("Errors")}}

The JavaScript warning "-file- is being assigned a //# sourceMappingURL, but already has one." occurs when a source map has been specified more than once for a given JavaScript source.

## Message

```
Warning: -file- is being assigned a //# sourceMappingURL, but already has one.
```

## Error type

A warning. JavaScript execution won't be halted.

## What went wrong?

A source map has been specified more than once for a given JavaScript source.

JavaScript sources are often combined and minified to make delivering them from the server more efficient. With [source maps](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/sourcemaps/), the debugger can map the code being executed to the original source files. There are two ways to assign a source map, either by using a comment or by setting a header to the JavaScript file.

## Examples

### Setting source maps

Setting a source map by using a comment in the file:

```js example-good
//# sourceMappingURL=http://example.com/path/to/your/sourcemap.map
```

Or, alternatively, you can set a header to your JavaScript file:

```http example-good
X-SourceMap: /path/to/file.js.map
```
