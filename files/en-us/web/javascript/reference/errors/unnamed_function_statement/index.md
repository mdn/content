The JavaScript exception "function statement requires a name" occurs when there is a [function statement](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)
in the code that requires a name.

## Message

```js
Syntax Error: Expected identifier (Edge)
SyntaxError: function statement requires a name [Firefox]
SyntaxError: Unexpected token ( [Chrome]
```

## Error type

{{jsxref("SyntaxError")}}

## What went wrong?

There is a [function
statement](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function) in the code that requires a name. You'll need to check how functions are
defined and if you need to provide a name for it, or if the function in question needs
to be a function expression, an [IIFE](/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE), or if the
function code is placed correctly in this context at all.

## Examples

### Statements vs expressions

A _[function
statement](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function)_ (or _function declaration_) requires a name, this won't
work:

```js example-bad
function () {
  return 'Hello world';
}
// SyntaxError: function statement requires a name
```

You can use a [function expression](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/function)
(assignment) instead:

```js example-good
var greet = function() {
  return 'Hello world';
};
```

Or, you function is maybe intended to be an [IIFE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately-invoked_function_expression)Â (Immediately
Invoked Function Expression), which is a function that runs as soon as it is defined.
You will need a few more braces in this case:

```js example-good
(function () {

})();
```

### Labeled functions

If you are using function [labels](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label), you will
still need to provide a function name after the `function` keyword. This
doesn't work:

```js example-bad
function Greeter() {
  german: function () {
    return "Moin";
  }
}
// SyntaxError: function statement requires a name
```

This would work, for example:

```js example-good
function Greeter() {
  german: function g() {
    return "Moin";
  }
}
```

### Object methods

If you intended to create a method of an object, you will need to create an object. The
following syntax without a name after the `function` keyword is valid then.

```js example-good
var greeter = {
  german: function () {
    return "Moin";
  }
};
```

### Callback syntax

Also, check your syntax when using callbacks. Brackets and commas can get difficult
easily.

```js example-bad
promise.then(
  function() {
    console.log("success");
  });
  function() {
    console.log("error");
}
// SyntaxError: function statement requires a name
```

Correct would be:

```json example-good
promise.then(
  function() {
    console.log("success");
  },
  function() {
    console.log("error");
  }
);
```
