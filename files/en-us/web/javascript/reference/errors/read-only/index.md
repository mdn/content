{{jsSidebar("Errors")}}

The JavaScript [strict mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode)-only exception
"is read-only" occurs when a global variable or object
property that was assigned to is a read-only property.

## Message

```
TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'x' of #<Object> (V8-based)
TypeError: "x" is read-only (Firefox)
TypeError: Attempted to assign to readonly property. (Safari)
```

## Error type

{{jsxref("TypeError")}} in [strict mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode) only.

## What went wrong?

The global variable or object property that was assigned to is a read-only property.
(Technically, it is a [non-writable data property](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/defineProperty#writable_attribute).)

This error happens only in [strict mode code](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode). In
non-strict code, the assignment is silently ignored.

## Examples

### Invalid cases

Read-only properties are not super common, but they can be created using
{{jsxref("Object.defineProperty()")}} or {{jsxref("Object.freeze()")}}.

```js example-bad
"use strict";
const obj = Object.freeze({ name: "Elsa", score: 157 });
obj.score = 0; // TypeError

("use strict");
Object.defineProperty(this, "LUNG_COUNT", { value: 2, writable: false });
LUNG_COUNT = 3; // TypeError

("use strict");
const frozenArray = Object.freeze([0, 1, 2]);
frozenArray[0]++; // TypeError
```

There are also a few read-only properties built into JavaScript. Maybe you tried to
redefine a mathematical constant.

```js example-bad
"use strict";
Math.PI = 4; // TypeError
```

Sorry, you can't do that.

The global variable `undefined` is also read-only, so you can't silence the
infamous "undefined is not a function" error by doing this:

```js example-bad
"use strict";
undefined = function () {}; // TypeError: "undefined" is read-only
```

### Valid cases

```js example-good
"use strict";
let obj = Object.freeze({ name: "Score", points: 157 });
obj = { name: obj.name, points: 0 }; // replacing it with a new object works
```
