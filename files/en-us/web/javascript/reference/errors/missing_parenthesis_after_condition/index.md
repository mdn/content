The JavaScript exception "missing ) after condition" occurs when there is an error with
how an
[`if`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)
condition is written. It must appear in parenthesis after the `if` keyword.

## Message

```js
SyntaxError: Expected ')' (Edge)
SyntaxError: missing ) after condition (Firefox)
```

## Error type

{{jsxref("SyntaxError")}}

## What went wrong?

There is an error with how an
[`if`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)
condition is written. In any programming language, code needs to make decisions and
carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs. The if statement executes a
statement if a specified condition is truthy. In JavaScript, this condition must appear
in parenthesis after the `if` keyword, like this:

```js
if (condition) {
  // do something if the condition is true
}
```

## Examples

### Missing parenthesis

It might just be an oversight, carefully check all you parenthesis in your code.

```js example-bad
if (3 > Math.PI {
  console.log("wait what?");
}

// SyntaxError: missing ) after condition
```

To fix this code, you would need to add a parenthesis that closes the condition.

```js example-good
if (3 > Math.PI) {
  console.log("wait what?");
}
```

### Misused `is` keyword

If you are coming from another programming language, it is also easy to add keywords
that don't mean the same or have no meaning at all in JavaScript.

```js example-bad
if (done is true) {
 console.log("we are done!");
}

// SyntaxError: missing ) after condition
```

Instead you need to use a correct [comparison
operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators). For example:

```js example-good
if (done === true) {
 console.log("we are done!");
}
```
