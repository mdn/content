{{jsSidebar("Errors")}}

The JavaScript exception "missing name after . operator" occurs when there is a problem
with how the dot operator (`.`) is used for [property
access](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_Accessors).

## Message

```js
SyntaxError: missing name after . operator
```

## Error type

{{jsxref("SyntaxError")}}

## What went wrong?

The dot operator (`.`) is used for [property
access](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_Accessors). You will have to specify the name of the property that you want to access.
For computed property access, you might need to change your property access from using a
dot to using square brackets. These will allow you to compute an expression. Maybe you
intended to do concatenation instead? A plus operator (`+`) is needed in that
case. Please see the examples below.

## Examples

### Property access

[Property
accessors](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Property_Accessors) in JavaScript use either the dot (.) or square brackets
(`[]`), but not both. Square brackets allow computed property access.

```js example-bad
var obj = { foo: { bar: "baz", bar2: "baz2" } };
var i = 2;

obj.[foo].[bar]
// SyntaxError: missing name after . operator

obj.foo."bar"+i;
// SyntaxError: missing name after . operator
```

To fix this code, you need to access the object like this:

```js example-good
obj.foo.bar; // "baz"
// or alternatively
obj["foo"]["bar"]; // "baz"

// computed properties require square brackets
obj.foo["bar" + i]; // "baz2"
```

### Property access vs. concatenation

If you are coming from another programming language (like [PHP](/en-US/docs/Glossary/PHP)), it is also easy to mix up the dot operator
(`.`) and the concatenation operator (`+`).

```js example-bad
console.log("Hello" . "world");

// SyntaxError: missing name after . operator
```

Instead you need to use a plus sign for concatenation:

```js example-good
console.log("Hello" + "World");
```
