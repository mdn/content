The JavaScript error "unterminated string literal" occurs when there is an unterminated
[string literal](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#string_literals) somewhere. String literals must be enclosed by single
(`'`) or double (`"`) quotes.

## Message

```js
SyntaxError: Unterminated string constant (Edge)
SyntaxError: unterminated string literal (Firefox)
```

## Error type

{{jsxref("SyntaxError")}}

## What went wrong?

There is an unterminated
[string literal](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#string_literals) somewhere. String literals must be
enclosed by single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes. JavaScript makes
no distinction between single-quoted strings and double-quoted strings. [Escape
sequences](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String#escape_notation) work in strings created with either single or double quotes. To fix this
error, check if:

- you have opening and closing quotes (single or double) for your string literal,
- you have escaped your string literal correctly,
- your string literalÂ isn't split across multiple lines.

## Examples

### Multiple lines

You can't split a string across multiple lines like this in JavaScript:

```js example-bad
var longString = 'This is a very long string which needs
                  to wrap across multiple lines because
                  otherwise my code is unreadable.';
// SyntaxError: unterminated string literal
```

Instead, use the [+
operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Addition), a backslash, or [template literals](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals).
The `+` operator variant looks like this:

```js example-good
var longString = 'This is a very long string which needs ' +
                 'to wrap across multiple lines because ' +
                 'otherwise my code is unreadable.';
```

Or you can use the backslash character ("\\") at the end of each line to indicate that
the string will continue on the next line. Make sure there is no space or any other
character after the backslash (except for a line break), or as an indent; otherwise it
will not work. That form looks like this:

```js example-good
var longString = 'This is a very long string which needs \
to wrap across multiple lines because \
otherwise my code is unreadable.';
```

Another possibility is to use [template literals](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals),
which are supported in ECMAScript 2015 environments:

```js example-good
var longString = `This is a very long string which needs
                  to wrap across multiple lines because
                  otherwise my code is unreadable.`;
```
