{{JSSidebar("Errors")}}

The JavaScript exception "can't access dead object" occurs when Firefox disallows
add-ons to keep strong references to DOM objects after their parent document has been
destroyed to improve in memory usage and to prevent memory leaks.

## Message

```js
TypeError: can't access dead object
```

## Error type

{{jsxref("TypeError")}}

## What went wrong?

To improve in memory usage and to prevent memory leaks, Firefox disallows add-ons to
keep strong references to DOM objects after their parent document has been destroyed. A
dead object, is holding a strong (keep alive) reference to a DOM element that persists
even after it was destroyed in the DOM. To avoid these issues, references to DOM nodes
in foreign document should instead be stored in an object which is specific to that
document, and cleaned up when the document is unloaded, or stored as [weak
references](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Language_Bindings/Components.utils.getWeakReference).

## Examples

### Checking if an object is dead

[Components.utils](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Tech/XPCOM/Language_Bindings/Components.utils)
offers a `isDeadWrapper()` method, which privileged code might use.

```js
if (Components.utils.isDeadWrapper(window)) {
  // dead
}
```

Unprivileged code has no access to Component.utils and might just be able catch the
exception.

```js
try {
  String(window);
} catch (e) {
  console.log("window is likely dead");
}
```
