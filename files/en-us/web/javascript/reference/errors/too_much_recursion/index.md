The JavaScript exception "too much recursion" or "Maximum call stack size exceeded"
occurs when there are too many function calls, or a function is missing a base case.

## Message

```js
Error: Out of stack space (Edge)
InternalError: too much recursion (Firefox)
RangeError: Maximum call stack size exceeded (Chrome)
```

## Error type

{{jsxref("InternalError")}}.

## What went wrong?

A function that calls itself is called a _recursive function_. Once a condition
is met, the function stops calling itself. This is called a _base case_.

In some ways, recursion is analogous to a loop. Both execute the same code multiple
times, and both require a condition (to avoid an infinite loop, or rather, infinite
recursion in this case). When there are too many function calls, or a function is
missing a base case, JavaScript will throw this error.

## Examples

This recursive function runs 10 times, as per the exit condition.

```js
function loop(x) {
  if (x >= 10) // "x >= 10" is the exit condition
    return;
  // do stuff
  loop(x + 1); // the recursive call
}
loop(0);
```

Setting this condition to an extremely high value, won't work:

```js example-bad
function loop(x) {
  if (x >= 1000000000000)
    return;
  // do stuff
  loop(x + 1);
}
loop(0);

// InternalError: too much recursion
```

This recursiveÂ function is missing a base case. As there is no exit condition, the
function will call itself infinitely.

```js example-bad
function loop(x) {
 // The base case is missing

loop(x + 1); // Recursive call
}

loop(0);

// InternalError: too much recursion
```

### Class error: too much recursion

```js example-bad
class Person{
	constructor(){}
	set name(name){
		this.name = name; // Recursive call
	}
}

const tony = new Person();
tony.name = "Tonisha"; // InternalError: too much recursion
```

When a value is assigned to the property name (this.name = name;) JavaScript needs to
set that property. When this happens, the setter function is triggered.

```js example-bad
set name(name){
	this.name = name; // Recursive call
}
```

> **Note:** In this example when the setter is triggered, it is told to do the same thing
> again: _to set the same property that it is meant to handle._ This causes
> the function to call itself, again and again, making it infinitely recursive.

This issue also appears if the same variable is used in the getter.

```js example-bad
get name(){
	return this.name; // Recursive call
}
```

To avoid this problem, make sure that the property being assigned to inside the setter
function is different from the one that initially triggered the setter.The same goes
for the getter.

```js
class Person{
	constructor(){}
	set name(name){
		this._name = name;
	}
	get name(){
		return this._name;
	}
}
const tony = new Person();
tony.name = "Tonisha";
console.log(tony);
```
