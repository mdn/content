{{jsSidebar("Errors")}}

The JavaScript exception "Permission denied to access property" occurs when there was
an attempt to access an object for which you have no permission.

## Message

```js
Error: Permission denied to access property "x"
```

## Error type

{{jsxref("Error")}}.

## What went wrong?

There was attempt to access an object for which you have no permission. This is likely
an {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} element loaded from a different domain for which you
violated the [same-origin
policy](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).

## Examples

### No permission to access document

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <iframe
      id="myframe"
      src="http://www1.w3c-test.org/common/blank.html"
    ></iframe>
    <script>
      onload = function () {
        console.log(frames[0].document);
        // Error: Permission denied to access property "document"
      };
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```
