{{jsSidebar("Errors")}}

The JavaScript exception "Permission denied to access property" occurs when there was
an attempt to access an object for which you have no permission.

## Message

```
DOMException: Blocked a frame with origin "x" from accessing a cross-origin frame. (Chromium-based)
DOMException: Permission denied to access property "x" on cross-origin object (Firefox)
SecurityError: Blocked a frame with origin "x" from accessing a cross-origin frame. Protocols, domains, and ports must match. (Safari)
```

## Error type

{{domxref("DOMException")}}.

## What went wrong?

There was attempt to access an object for which you have no permission. This is likely
an {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} element loaded from a different domain for which you
violated the [same-origin policy](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy).

## Examples

### No permission to access document

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-US">
  <head>
    <iframe
      id="myframe"
      src="http://www1.w3c-test.org/common/blank.html"></iframe>
    <script>
      onload = function () {
        console.log(frames[0].document);
        // Error: Permission denied to access property "document"
      };
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```
