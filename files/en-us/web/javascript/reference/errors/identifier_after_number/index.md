{{JSSidebar("Errors")}}

The JavaScript exception "identifier starts immediately after numeric literal" occurs
when an identifier started with a digit. Identifiers can only start with a letter,
underscore (\_), or dollar sign ($).

## Message

```js
SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier after numeric literal (Edge)
SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal (Firefox)
SyntaxError: Unexpected number (Chrome)
```

## Error type

{{jsxref("SyntaxError")}}

## What went wrong?

The names of variables, called [identifiers](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Identifier), conform to certain rules,
which your code mustÂ adhere to!

A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (\_), or dollar sign ($).
They can't start with a digit! Only subsequent characters can be digits (0-9).

## Examples

### Variable names starting with numeric literals

Variable names can't start with numbers in JavaScript. The following fails:

```js example-bad
var 1life = 'foo';
// SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

var foo = 1life;
// SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal

alert(1.foo);
// SyntaxError: identifier starts immediately after numeric literal
```

You will need to rename your variable to avoid the leading number.

```js example-good
var life1 = "foo";
var foo = life1;
```
