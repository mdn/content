{{jsSidebar("Errors")}}

The JavaScript warning "test for equality (==) mistyped as assignment (=)?" occurs when
there was an assignment (`=`) when you would normally expect a test for
equality (`==`).

## Message

```
Warning: SyntaxError: test for equality (==) mistyped as assignment (=)?
```

## Error type

(Firefox only) {{jsxref("SyntaxError")}} warning which is reported only if
`javascript.options.strict` preference is set to `true`.

## What went wrong?

There was an assignment (`=`) when you would normally expect a test for
equality (`==`). To help debugging, JavaScript (with strict warnings enabled)
warns about this pattern.

## Examples

### Assignment within conditional expressions

It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression (such as
[`if...else`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)),
because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For
example, do not use the following code:

```js-nolint example-bad
if (x = y) {
  // do the right thing
}
```

If you need to use an assignment in a conditional expression, a common practice is to
put additional parentheses around the assignment. For example:

```js
if ((x = y)) {
  // do the right thing
}
```

Otherwise, you probably meant to use a comparison operator (e.g. `==` or
`===`):

```js
if (x === y) {
  // do the right thing
}
```
