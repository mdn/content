<p>The JavaScript <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode">strict
    mode</a>-only exception "Assignment to undeclated variable" occurs when the value has
  been assigned to an undeclared variable.</p>

<h2 id="Message">Message</h2>

<pre class="brush: js">ReferenceError: assignment to undeclared variable "x" (Firefox)
ReferenceError: "x" is not defined (Chrome)
ReferenceError: Variable undefined in strict mode (Edge)
</pre>

<p>{{jsxref("ReferenceError")}} warning in <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode">strict mode</a> only.</p>

<h2 id="What_went_wrong">What went wrong?</h2>

<p>A value has been assigned to an undeclared variable. In other words, there was an
  assignment without the <code>var</code> keyword. There are some differences between
  declared and undeclared variables, which might lead to unexpected results and that's why
  JavaScript presents an error in strict mode.</p>

<p>Three things to note about declared and undeclared variables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Declared variables are constrained in the execution context in which they are
    declared. Undeclared variables are always global.</li>
  <li>Declared variables are created before any code is executed. Undeclared variables do
    not exist until the code assigning to them is executed.</li>
  <li>Declared variables are a non-configurable property of their execution context
    (function or global). Undeclared variables are configurable (e.g. can be deleted).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For more details and examples, see the
  <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var">var</a></code>
  reference page.</p>

<p>Errors about undeclared variable assignments occur in <a
    href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode">strict mode code</a> only. In
  non-strict code, they are silently ignored.</p>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<h3 id="Invalid_cases">Invalid cases</h3>

<p>In this case, the variable "bar" is an undeclared variable.</p>

<pre class="brush: js example-bad">function foo() {
  'use strict';
  bar = true;
}
foo(); // ReferenceError: assignment to undeclared variable bar
</pre>

<h3 id="Valid_cases">Valid cases</h3>

<p>To make "bar" a declared variable, you can add the
  <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var">var</a></code>
  keyword in front of it.</p>

<pre class="brush: js example-good">function foo() {
  'use strict';
  var bar = true;
}
foo();</pre>
