{{jsSidebar("Errors")}}

The JavaScript [strict
mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode)-only exception "Assignment to undeclated variable" occurs when the value has
been assigned to an undeclared variable.

## Message

```js
ReferenceError: assignment to undeclared variable "x" (Firefox)
ReferenceError: "x" is not defined (Chrome)
ReferenceError: Variable undefined in strict mode (Edge)
```

## Error type

{{jsxref("ReferenceError")}} warning in [strict mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode) only.

## What went wrong?

A value has been assigned to an undeclared variable. In other words, there was an
assignment without the `var` keyword. There are some differences between
declared and undeclared variables, which might lead to unexpected results and that's why
JavaScript presents an error in strict mode.

Three things to note about declared and undeclared variables:

- Declared variables are constrained in the execution context in which they are
  declared. Undeclared variables are always global.
- Declared variables are created before any code is executed. Undeclared variables do
  not exist until the code assigning to them is executed.
- Declared variables are a non-configurable property of their execution context
  (function or global). Undeclared variables are configurable (e.g. can be deleted).

For more details and examples, see the
[`var`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var)
reference page.

Errors about undeclared variable assignments occur in [strict mode code](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode) only. In
non-strict code, they are silently ignored.

## Examples

### Invalid cases

In this case, the variable "bar" is an undeclared variable.

```js example-bad
function foo() {
  "use strict";
  bar = true;
}
foo(); // ReferenceError: assignment to undeclared variable bar
```

### Valid cases

To make "bar" a declared variable, you can add the
[`var`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var)
keyword in front of it.

```js example-good
function foo() {
  "use strict";
  var bar = true;
}
foo();
```
