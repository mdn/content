{{jsSidebar("Errors")}}

The JavaScript warning "expression closures are deprecated" occurs when the
non-standard expression closure
syntax (shorthand function syntax) is used. This syntax is now removed and the warning message is obsolete.

## Message

```
Warning: expression closures are deprecated
```

## Error type

Warning. JavaScript execution won't be halted.

## What went wrong?

The non-standard expression closure
syntax (shorthand function syntax) is deprecated and shouldn't be used
anymore. This syntax has been removed entirely in [bug 1083458](https://bugzil.la/1083458) and
scripts using it will throw a {{jsxref("SyntaxError")}} in newer versions of Firefox.

## Examples

### Deprecated syntax

Expression closures omit curly braces or return statements from function declarations
or from method definitions in objects.

```js example-bad
var x = function () 1;

var obj = {
  count: function () 1
};
```

### Standard syntax

To convert the non-standard expression closures syntax to standard ECMAScript syntax,
you can add curly braces and return statements.

```js example-good
const x = function () {
  return 1;
};

const obj = {
  count() {
    return 1;
  },
};
```

### Standard syntax using arrow functions

Alternatively, you can use [arrow functions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions):

```js example-good
const x = () => 1;
```

### Standard syntax using shorthand method syntax

Expression closures can also be found with getter and setter, like this:

```js example-bad
var obj = {
  get x() 1,
  set x(v) this.v = v
};
```

With [method definitions](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions), this can be converted to:

```js example-good
const obj = {
  get x() {
    return 1;
  },
  set x(v) {
    this.v = v;
  },
};
```
