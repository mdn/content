<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Whereas <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a> defines a webpage's structure and content and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS">CSS</a> sets the formatting and appearance, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> adds interactivity to a webpage and creates rich web applications.</p>

<p>However, the umbrella term "JavaScript" as understood in a web browser context contains several very different elements. One of them is the core language (ECMAScript), another is the collection of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/API">Web APIs</a>, including the DOM (Document Object Model).</p>

<h2 id="JavaScript_the_core_language_ECMAScript">JavaScript, the core language (ECMAScript)</h2>

<p>The core language of JavaScript is standardized by the ECMA TC39 committee as a language named <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Language_Resources">ECMAScript</a>.</p>

<p>This core language is also used in non-browser environments, for example in <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>.</p>

<h3 id="What_falls_under_the_ECMAScript_scope">What falls under the ECMAScript scope?</h3>

<p>Among other things, ECMAScript defines:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Language syntax (parsing rules, keywords, control flow, object literal initialization, ...)</li>
 <li>Error handling mechanisms ({{jsxref("Statements/throw", "throw")}}, {{jsxref("Statements/try...catch", "try...catch")}}, ability to create user-defined {{jsxref("Error")}} types)</li>
 <li>Types (boolean, number, string, function, object, ...)</li>
 <li>The global object. In a browser, this global object is the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window" title="The Window interface represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window."><code>window</code></a> object, but ECMAScript only defines the APIs not specific to browsers, e.g. {{jsxref("parseInt")}}, {{jsxref("parseFloat")}}, {{jsxref("decodeURI")}}, {{jsxref("encodeURI")}}...</li>
 <li>A prototype-based inheritance mechanism</li>
 <li>Built-in objects and functions ({{jsxref("JSON")}}, {{jsxref("Math")}}, {{jsxref("Array.prototype", "Array.prototype", "Methods")}} methods, {{jsxref("Object")}} introspection methods, etc.)</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode">Strict mode</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Browser_support">Browser support</h3>

<p>As of October 2016, the current versions of the major Web browsers implement <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/ECMAScript_5_support_in_Mozilla">ECMAScript 5.1</a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/New_in_JavaScript/ECMAScript_2015_support_in_Mozilla">ECMAScript 2015</a>, but older versions (still in use) implement ECMAScript 5 only.</p>

<h3 id="Future">Future</h3>

<p>The major 6th Edition of ECMAScript was officially approved and published as a standard on June 17, 2015 by the ECMA General Assembly. Since then ECMAScript Editions are published on a yearly basis.</p>

<h3 id="Internationalization_API">Internationalization API</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/">ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification</a> is an addition to the ECMAScript Language Specification, also standardized by Ecma TC39. The internationalization API provides collation (string comparison), number formatting, and date-and-time formatting for JavaScript applications, letting the applications choose the language and tailor the functionality to their needs. The initial standard was approved in December 2012; the status of implementations in browsers is tracked in the documentation of the {{jsxref("Intl")}} object. The Internationalization specification is nowadays also ratified on a yearly basis and browsers constantly improve their implementation.</p>

<h3 id="WebIDL">WebIDL</h3>

<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/">WebIDL specification</a> provides the glue between the DOM technologies and ECMAScript.</p>

<h3 id="The_Core_of_the_DOM">The Core of the DOM</h3>

<p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform, <strong>language-independent convention</strong> for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML and XML documents. Objects in the <strong>DOM tree</strong> may be addressed and manipulated by using methods on the objects. The <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/W3C">W3C</a> standardizes the Core Document Object Model, which defines language-agnostic interfaces that abstract HTML and XML documents as objects, and also defines mechanisms to manipulate this abstraction. Among the things defined by the DOM, we can find:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The document structure, a tree model, and the DOM Event architecture in <a href="http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/domcore/raw-file/tip/Overview.html">DOM core</a>: <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node" title="Node is an interface from which various types of DOM API objects inherit, allowing those types to be treated similarly; for example, inheriting the same set of methods, or being testable in the same way."><code>Node</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element" title="Element is the most general base class from which all element objects (i.e. objects that represent elements) in a Document inherit. It only has methods and properties common to all kinds of elements. More specific classes inherit from Element."><code>Element</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentFragment" title="The DocumentFragment interface represents a minimal document object that has no parent. It is used as a lightweight version of Document that stores a segment of a document structure comprised of nodes just like a standard document."><code>DocumentFragment</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document" title="The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree."><code>Document</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMImplementation" title="The DOMImplementation interface represents an object providing methods which are not dependent on any particular document. Such an object is returned by the Document.implementation property."><code>DOMImplementation</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event" title="The Event interface represents an event which takes place in the DOM."><code>Event</code></a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget" title="EventTarget is a DOM interface implemented by objects that can receive events and may have listeners for them."><code>EventTarget</code></a>, …</li>
 <li>A less rigorous definition of the DOM Event Architecture, as well as specific events in <a href="http://dev.w3.org/2006/webapi/DOM-Level-3-Events/html/DOM3-Events.html">DOM events</a>.</li>
 <li>Other things such as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Traversal-Range/traversal.html">DOM Traversal</a> and <a href="http://html5.org/specs/dom-range.html">DOM Range</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the ECMAScript point of view, objects defined in the DOM specification are called "host objects".</p>

<h3 id="HTML_DOM">HTML DOM</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.whatwg.org/html">HTML</a>, the Web's markup language, is specified in terms of the DOM. Layered above the abstract concepts defined in DOM Core, HTML also defines the <em>meaning</em> of elements. The HTML DOM includes such things as the <code>className</code> property on HTML elements, or APIs such as <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/body" title="The Document.body property represents the &lt;body&gt; or &lt;frameset&gt; node of the current document, or null if no such element exists."><code>document.body</code></a>.</p>

<p>The HTML specification also defines restrictions on documents; for example, it requires all children of a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ul" title="The HTML &lt;ul&gt; element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list."><code>&lt;ul&gt;</code></a> element, which represents an unordered list, to be <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/li" title="The HTML &lt;li&gt; element is used to represent an item in a list."><code>&lt;li&gt;</code></a> elements, as those represent list items. In general, it also forbids using elements and attributes that aren't defined in a standard.</p>

<p>Looking for the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document" title="The Document interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree."><code>Document</code></a> object, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window" title="The Window interface represents a window containing a DOM document; the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window."><code>Window</code></a> object, and the other DOM elements? Read the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model">DOM documentation</a>.</p>

 <li>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout"><code>setTimeout</code></a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval"><code>setInterval</code></a> functions were first specified on the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window"><code>Window</code></a> interface in HTML Standard.</li>
 <li><a href="https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/xhr/raw-file/tip/Overview.html">XMLHttpRequest</a> makes it possible to send asynchronous HTTP requests.</li>
