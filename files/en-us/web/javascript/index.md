JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is best known as a scripting language for Web pages, it is also used in many non-browser environments such as [Node.js](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Node.js), [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/), and [Adobe Acrobat](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/acrobatsdk/). JavaScript is a dynamic, prototype-based language with garbage collection, supporting multiple programming paradigms, including imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming.

## Dynamic Features

JavaScript provides dynamic capabilities including:

- Creating objects at runtime
- Variadic functions
- Dynamic script generation (via [`eval`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval))
- Object introspection (using [`for...in`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) and [`Object.toString()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/toString))
- Source code recovery (functions store their source text and can be retrieved with [`Function.prototype.toString()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/toString))

This section focuses on the JavaScript language itself, not the environment-specific APIs. For Web-specific APIs, see [Web APIs](/en-US/docs/Web/API) and the [DOM](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model).

## Standards

The JavaScript language is standardized through the [ECMAScript specification (ECMA-262)](https://tc39.es/ecma262/) and the [Internationalization API specification (ECMA-402)](https://tc39.es/ecma402/). As soon as a browser implements a feature, MDN attempts to document it. For some new ECMAScript proposals, the documentation and examples may use features implemented in browsers before official specification publication.

## JavaScript vs Java

JavaScript is not "interpreted Java". Java and JavaScript are trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries, but they are distinct languages with different syntax, semantics, and use cases.
