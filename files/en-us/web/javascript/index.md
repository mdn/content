**JavaScript** (**JS**) is a lightweight, interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language with first-class functions. While it is best known as a scripting language for web pages, it is also used in many non-browser environments such as [Node.js](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Node.js), [Apache CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/), and [Adobe Acrobat](https://opensource.adobe.com/dc-acrobat-sdk-docs/acrobatsdk/). JavaScript is a dynamic, prototype-based language with garbage collection, supporting multiple programming paradigms, including imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming.

## Dynamic features

JavaScript provides a number of dynamic capabilities, including:

* Runtime object creation
* Variadic functions
* Dynamic script generation (via [`eval`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval))
* Object introspection (using [`for...in`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) and [`Object`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) utilities)
* Source code recovery (functions store their source text and can be retrieved using [`Function.prototype.toString()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/toString))

This documentation focuses on the JavaScript language itself and not on environment-specific APIs. For information about web-specific APIs, see [Web APIs](/en-US/docs/Web/API) and the [DOM](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model).

## Standards

The JavaScript language is standardized through the [ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262)](https://tc39.es/ecma262/) and the [ECMAScript Internationalization API Specification (ECMA-402)](https://tc39.es/ecma402/). As soon as a browser implements a feature, MDN attempts to document it. In some cases, documentation and examples may include features that have been implemented in browsers prior to final specification publication.

## JavaScript vs. Java

Do not confuse JavaScript with the [Java programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29). Although both are trademarks or registered trademarks of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries, JavaScript and Java are distinct languages with different syntax, semantics, and use cases.
