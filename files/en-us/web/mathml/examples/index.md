Below you'll find some examples you can look at to help you to understand how to use MathML to display increasingly complex mathematical concepts in Web content.

- [Pythagorean Theorem](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Examples/MathML_Pythagorean_Theorem)
  - : Small example showing a proof of the Pythagorean Theorem.
- [Deriving the Quadratic Formula](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Examples/Deriving_the_Quadratic_Formula)
  - : Outlines the derivation of the Quadratic Formula.
- [Mozilla MathML Test](https://fred-wang.github.io/MathFonts/mozilla_mathml_test/)
  - : Original test from the Mozilla MathML project. It contains examples from the [TeXbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers_and_Typesetting) with image references generated by TeX.
- [MathML Browser Test](http://eyeasme.com/Joe/MathML/MathML_browser_test.html )
  - : A similar test with concrete formulas taken from Wikipedia.
