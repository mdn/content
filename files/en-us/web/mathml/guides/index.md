This page lists guides for MathML to help you author MathML on your web pages, including guidance on writing, editors, fonts, and more.

- [Authoring MathML](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Authoring)
  - : This page explains how to write mathematics using the MathML language, which is described with tags and attributes in text format.
- [Fonts for MathML](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Fonts)
  - : Fonts with appropriate Unicode coverage and Open Font Format features are required for good math rendering. This page describes how users can install such math fonts to properly display MathML in browsers.

## Examples

To complement guides, the following pages demonstrate how MathML can be used in real derivations and proofs.

- [Proving the Pythagorean theorem](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Proving_the_Pythagorean_theorem)
  - : This page outlines the proof of the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) using MathML to structure each step visually.
- [Deriving the quadratic formula](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Deriving_the_quadratic_formula)
  - : This page outlines the derivation of the [quadratic formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_formula), showing how MathML can be used to present each transformation.
