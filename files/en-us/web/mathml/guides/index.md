The following guides provide a gentle beginning to your path towards MathML mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it inside HTML.

## Guides

- [Getting started with MathML](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Getting_started)
  - : In this article, we will take a simple HTML document and see how to add MathML formulas into it, introducing a few elements along the way.
- [Text containers](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Text_containers)
  - : Now that you get a better idea of MathML, we move on to text containers (variables, numbers, operators, ...) which are used as building blocks of MathML formulas.
- [Fractions and roots](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Fractions_and_roots)
  - : Relying on text containers, this article describes how to build more complex MathML expressions by nesting fractions and roots.
- [Scripts](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Scripts)
  - : We continue the review of basic math notations and focuses on building MathML elements with scripts.
- [Tables](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Tables)
  - : Once all basic math notations are known, it remains to consider tabular layout which can be used for matrix-like expressions and other advanced math layout.

## Challenges

- [Three famous mathematical formulas](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Three_famous_mathematical_formulas)
  - : With the things you have learned in the last few articles, you should already be able to write relatively sophisticated MathML formulas. This challenge gives you a chance to do that.
