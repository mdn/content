The following guides provide a gentle beginning to your path towards MathML mastery with the basics of how it works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it inside HTML.

## Guides

- [Getting started with MathML](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Getting_started)
  - : In this article, we will take a simple HTML document and see how to add MathML formulas into it, introducing a few elements along the way.
- [Text containers](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Text_containers)
  - : Now that you get a better idea of MathML, we move on to text containers (variables, numbers, operators, ...) which are used as building blocks of MathML formulas.
- [Fractions and roots](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Fractions_and_roots)
  - : Relying on text containers, this article describes how to build more complex MathML expressions by nesting fractions and roots.
- [Scripts](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Scripts)
  - : We continue the review of basic math notations and focuses on building MathML elements with scripts.
- [Tables](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Tables)
  - : Once all basic math notations are known, it remains to consider tabular layout which can be used for matrix-like expressions and other advanced math layout.

## Challenges

- [Three famous mathematical formulas](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Three_famous_mathematical_formulas)
  - : With the things you have learned in the last few articles, you should already be able to write relatively sophisticated MathML formulas. This challenge gives you a chance to do that.

## Examples

Below you'll find some examples you can look at to help you to understand how to use MathML.

### MathML formulas

The following demos display increasingly complex mathematical concepts in Web content.

- [Pythagorean Theorem](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Proving_the_Pythagorean_theorem)
  - : Small example showing a proof of the Pythagorean Theorem.
- [Deriving the Quadratic Formula](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Deriving_the_quadratic_formula)
  - : Outlines the derivation of the Quadratic Formula.
- [Mozilla MathML Test](https://fred-wang.github.io/MathFonts/mozilla_mathml_test/)
  - : Original test from the Mozilla MathML project. It contains examples from the [TeXbook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computers_and_Typesetting) with image references generated by TeX.
- [MathML Browser Test](http://eyeasme.com/Joe/MathML/MathML_browser_test.html)
  - : A similar test with concrete formulas taken from Wikipedia.

### Other Web technologies

The following demos mix MathML with other Web technologies to produce advanced content.

- [`<la-tex>` custom element](https://fred-wang.github.io/TeXZilla/examples/customElement.html)
  - : A [custom element](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_custom_elements) that accepts [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) content.
- [Magnetic field demo](https://fred-wang.github.io/TeXZilla/examples/toImageWebGL.html)
  - : A 3D representation of a magnetic field, using [SVG](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) and [WebGL](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API).
- [Συνάρτηση ζήτα Ρήμαν (el)](https://fred-wang.github.io/MathFonts/%CE%A3%CF%85%CE%BD%CE%AC%CF%81%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7_%CE%B6%CE%AE%CF%84%CE%B1_%CE%A1%CE%AE%CE%BC%CE%B1%CE%BD.html)
  - : A greek article about the Riemann zeta function, with [Web fonts](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Text_styling/Web_fonts) from the [Greek Font Society](https://greekfontsociety-gfs.gr/).
- [Pell's equation](https://people.igalia.com/fwang/pell-bigint-mathml/)
  - : A JavaScript program to solve Pell's equation using [`BigInt`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/BigInt).
- [Lovelace's program for Bernoulli numbers](https://people.igalia.com/fwang/lovelace-jsclass-mathml/)
  - : An emulator for Ada Lovelace's program to calculate Bernoulli numbers, using [Private properties](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Private_properties).
