**Mathematical Markup Language (MathML)** is an [XML](/en-US/docs/Web/XML)-based language for describing mathematical notation.

[MathML](https://w3c.github.io/mathml/) was originally designed as a general-purpose specification for browsers, office suites, [computer algebra systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system), [EPUB](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub33/) readers, [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)-based generators. However, this approach was not very adapted to the Web: the [subset focusing on semantics](https://w3c.github.io/mathml/#contm) has never been implemented in browsers while the [subset focusing on math layout](https://w3c.github.io/mathml/#presm) led to incomplete and inconsistent browser implementations.

[MathML Core](https://w3c.github.io/mathml-core/) is a subset with increased implementation details based on rules from [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) and the [Open Font Format](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/math). It is tailored for browsers and designed specifically to work well with other web standards including [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), [DOM](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model), [JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

Below you will find links to documentation, examples, and tools to work with MathML. MDN uses [MathML Core](https://w3c.github.io/mathml-core/) as a reference specification but, due to an erratic standardization history, legacy MathML features may still show up in existing implementations and web content.

> [!NOTE]
> It is highly recommended that developers and authors switch to MathML Core, perhaps relying on other web technologies to cover missing use cases. The Math WG is maintaining a set of [MathML polyfills](https://github.com/w3c/mathml-polyfills) to facilitate that transition.

## Beginner's tutorials

- [Getting started with MathML](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Getting_started)
  - : In this article, we will take a simple HTML document and see how to add MathML formulas into it, introducing a few elements along the way.
- [Text containers](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Text_containers)
  - : Now that you get a better idea of MathML, we move on to text containers (variables, numbers, operators, ...) which are used as building blocks of MathML formulas.
- [Fractions and roots](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Fractions_and_roots)
  - : Relying on text containers, this article describes how to build more complex MathML expressions by nesting fractions and roots.
- [Scripts](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Scripts)
  - : We continue the review of basic math notations and focuses on building MathML elements with scripts.
- [Tables](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Tables)
  - : Once all basic math notations are known, it remains to consider tabular layout which can be used for matrix-like expressions and other advanced math layout.
- [Three famous mathematical formulas](/en-US/docs/Web/MathML/Guides/Three_famous_mathematical_formulas) <sup>Challenge</sup>
  - : With the things you have learned in the last few articles, you should already be able to write relatively sophisticated MathML formulas. This challenge gives you a chance to do that.

## Guides
