**Mathematical Markup Language (MathML)** is an [XML](/en-US/docs/Web/XML)-based language for describing mathematical notation.

[MathML](https://w3c.github.io/mathml/) was originally designed as a general-purpose specification for browsers, office suites, [computer algebra systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system), [EPUB](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub32/) readers, [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX)-based generators. However, this approach was not very adapted to the Web: the [subset focusing on semantics](https://w3c.github.io/mathml/#contm) has never been implemented in browsers while the [subset focusing on math layout](https://w3c.github.io/mathml/#presm) led to incomplete and inconsistent browser implementations.

[MathML Core](https://w3c.github.io/mathml-core/) is a subset with increased implementation details based on rules from [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) and the [Open Font Format](https://docs.microsoft.com/typography/opentype/spec/math). It is tailored for browsers and designed specifically to work well with other web standards including [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), [DOM](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model), [JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).

Below you will find links to documentation, examples, and tools to work with MathML. Although many of these still use the [MathML Full](https://w3c.github.io/mathml/) specification as a reference, transition towards [MathML Core](https://w3c.github.io/mathml-core/) is in progress. It is highly recommended that developers and authors switch to that specification, perhaps relying on other web technologies to cover missing use cases from the legacy specification.
