<div class="blockIndicator obsolete">
<p><strong>Obsolete since Google Chrome 73</strong><br>
 This feature is obsolete. Although it may still work in some browsers, its use is discouraged since it could be removed at any time. Try to avoid using it.</p>
</div>

<div class="notecard warning">
<p>Firefox will not ship <em>HTML Imports</em> in its current form. See this <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2015/06/the-state-of-web-components/">status update</a> for more information. Until there is a consensus on the standard or alternative mechanisms are worked out, you can use a polyfill such as Google's <code><a href="https://github.com/webcomponents/webcomponentsjs">webcomponents.js</a></code>.</p>
</div>

<p><em>HTML Imports</em> is intended to be the packaging mechanism for <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components">web components</a>, but you can also use HTML Imports by itself.</p>

<p>You import an HTML file by using a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link"><code>&lt;link&gt;</code></a> tag in an HTML document like this:</p>

<pre>&lt;link rel="import" href="myfile.html"&gt;</pre>

<p>The <code>import</code> link type is new.</p>
