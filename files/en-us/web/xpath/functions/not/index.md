The `not` function evaluates a boolean expression and returns the opposite value.

### Syntax

    not(expression )

### Arguments

- `expression`
  - : The expression is evaluated exactly as if it were passed as an argument to the [boolean()](/en-US/docs/Web/XPath/Functions/boolean) function.

### Returns

True for an expression that evaluates to false; false for an expression that evaluates to true.

### Notes

- This function should behave similarly to the [boolean()](/en-US/docs/Web/XPath/Functions/boolean) function except that it returns the opposite value.
- You can test if an element doesn't have some attribute.

           either has no 'name' attribute at all, or it has one,
           but its value is not "badname". -->
