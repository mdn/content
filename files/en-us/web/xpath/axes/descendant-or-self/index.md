<p>The <code>descendant-or-self</code> axis indicates the context node and all of its descendants. Attribute and namespace nodes are <strong>not</strong> included - the <code>parent</code> of an <code>attribute</code> node is an element node, but <code>attribute</code> nodes are not the children of their parents.</p>
