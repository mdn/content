<p>The <code>descendant</code> axis indicates all of the children of the context node, and all of their children, and so forth. Attribute and namespace nodes are <strong>not</strong> included - the <code>parent</code> of an <code>attribute</code> node is an element node, but <code>attribute</code> nodes are not the children of their parents.</p>
