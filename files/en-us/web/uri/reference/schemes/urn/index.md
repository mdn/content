A Uniform Resource Name (URN) is a URI that identifies a resource by name in a particular namespace.
URNs provide globally-unique names for resources as opposed to providing information about their location (URL).

## Syntax

An URN minimally consists of a Namespace Identifier (NID) and a Namespace Specific String (NSS):

```url
urn:<NID>:<NSS>
```

## Components

- `<NID>`
  - : A NID (Namespace Identifier) is a case insensitive identifier for the namespace (e.g., `ISBN` and `isbn` are equivalent).
    NIDs are maintained by [registries such as IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/urn-namespaces/urn-namespaces.xhtml), and their resolution depends on the specific namespace.
    For instance, the `ISBN` NID resolution is handled by [International ISBN Agency](https://www.isbn-international.org/) systems.
- `<NSS>`
  - : The NSS (Namespace Specific String) is a string unique within a URN namespace.
    The combination of the NID (unique across the entire "urn" scheme) and the NSS ensures that the resulting URN is globally unique.

## Examples

### ISBN URN

This ISBN corresponds to the book [Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780141036144):

```url
urn:isbn:9780141036144
```

### IETF URN

This URN corresponds to the IETF specification {{rfc("7230", "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP/1.1): Message Syntax and Routing")}}:

```url
urn:ietf:rfc:7230
```
