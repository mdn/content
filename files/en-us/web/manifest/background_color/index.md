The `background_color` member defines a placeholder background color for the application page to display before its stylesheet is loaded. This value is used by the user agent to draw the background color of a shortcut when the manifest is available before the stylesheet has loaded.

Therefore `background_color` should match the {{cssxref("background-color")}} CSS property in the siteâ€™s stylesheet for a smooth transition between launching the web application and loading the site's content.

> **Note:** The `background_color` member is only meant to improve the user experience while the main stylesheet is loading from the network or the storage media; it is not used by the user agent as the {{cssxref("background-color")}} CSS property when the progressive web app stylesheet is available.

## Examples
