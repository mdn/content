The _`iarc_rating_id`_ member is a string that represents the [International Age Rating Coalition (IARC)](https://www.globalratings.com/) certification code of the web application. It is intended to be used to determine which ages the web application is appropriate for.

> **Note:** The same code can be shared across multiple participating storefronts, as long as the distributed product remains the same (i.e., doesnâ€™t serve totally different code paths on different storefronts).

## Examples

```json
"iarc_rating_id": "e84b072d-71b3-4d3e-86ae-31a8ce4e53b7"
