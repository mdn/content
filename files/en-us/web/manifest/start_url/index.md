The _`start_url`_ member is a string that represents the _start URL of the web application_ â€” the preferred URL that should be loaded when the user launches the web application (e.g., when the user taps on the web application's icon from a device's application menu or homescreen).

> **Note:** The `start_url` member is purely advisory, and a user agent may ignore it or allow the user to alter it at install time or afterwards.

## Examples

### Absolute URL

```json
"start_url": "https://example.com"
```

### Relative URL

If the URL is relative, the manifest URL is used as the base URL to resolve it.

```json
"start_url": "../startpoint.html"
```
