**XHTML** is a term that was historically used to describe [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) documents written to conform with {{Glossary("XML")}} syntax rules.

The following example shows an HTML document and corresponding "XHTML" document, and the accompanying {{Glossary("HTTP")}} {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}} headers they should be served with.

### HTML document

```html
Content-Type: text/html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang=en>
  <head>
    <meta charset=utf-8>
    <title>HTML</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I am a HTML document</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

### XHTML document

```xml
Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xml:lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>XHTML</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>I am a XHTML document</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

In practice, very few "XHTML" documents are served over the web with a `Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml` header. Instead, even though the documents are written to conform to XML syntax rules, they are served with a `Content-Type: text/html` header â€” so browsers parse those documents using HTML parsers rather than XML parsers, which can cause a variety of sometimes-very-surprising problems.
