This page provides solutions to the challenges posed in the [CSS Getting Started](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps) tutorial. These are not the only possible solutions. The sections below correspond to the titles of the tutorial sections.

## Why use CSS

The challenges on page [Why use CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/How_CSS_works) are:

### Colors

- Challenge
  - : Without looking up a reference, find five more color names that work in your stylesheet.
- Solution
  - : CSS supports common color names like `orange`, `yellow`, `blue`, `green`, or `black`. It also supports some more exotic color names like `chartreuse`, `fuschia`, or `burlywood`. See [CSS Color value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value) for a complete list as well as other ways of specifying colors.

## How CSS works

The challenges on page [How CSS works](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps/How_CSS_works) are:

### DOM inspector

- Challenge
  - : In DOMi, click on a STRONG node. Use DOMi's right-hand pane to find out where the node's color is set to red, and where its appearance is made bolder than normal text.
- Solution
  - : In the menu above the right-hand pane, choose **CSS Rules**.  You see two items listed, one that references an internal resource and one that references your stylesheet file. The internal resource defines the **font-weight** property as `bolder`; your stylesheet defines the **color** property as `red`.

## Cascading and inheritance

The challenges on page [Cascading and inheritance](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Cascade_and_inheritance) are:

### Inherited styles

- Challenge
  - : Change your stylesheet so that only the red letters are underlined.
- Solution

  - : Move the declaration for underlining from the rule for {{ HTMLElement("p") }} to the one for {{ HTMLElement("strong") }}. The resulting file looks like this:

    ```css
    p {color: blue; }
    strong {color: orange; text-decoration: underline;}
    ```

Later sections of this tutorial describe style rules and declarations in greater detail.

## Selectors

The challenges on page [Selectors](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors) are:

### Second paragraph blue

- Challenge
  - : Without changing your HTML file, add a single rule to your CSS file that keeps all the initial letters the same color as they are now, but makes all the other text in the second paragraph blue.
- Solution

  - : Add a rule with an ID selector of `#second` and a declaration `color: blue;`, as shown below:

    ```css
    #second { color: blue; }
    ```

    A more specific selector, `p#second` also works.

### Both paragraphs blue

- Challenge
  - : Now change the rule you have just added (without changing anything else), to make the first paragraph blue too.
- Solution

  - : Change the selector of the new rule to be a tag selector using `p`:

    ```css
    p { color: blue; }
    ```

The rules for the other colors all have more specific selectors, so they override the blue of the paragraph.

## Readable CSS

### Commenting out a rule

- Challenge
  - : Comment out part of your stylesheet, without changing anything else, to make the very first letter of your document red.
- Solution

  - : One way to do this is to put comment delimiters around the rule for `.carrot`:

    ```css
    /*
    .carrot {
      color: orange;
    }
    */
    ```

## Text styles

### Big initial letters

- Challenge
  - : Without changing anything else, make all six initial letters twice the size in the browser's default serif font.
- Solution

  - : Add the following style declaration to the `strong` rule:

    ```css
      font: 200% serif;
    ```

    If you use separate declarations for `font-size` and `font-family`, then the `font-style` setting on the first paragraph is _not_ overridden.

## Color

### Three-digit color codes

- Challenge
  - : In your CSS file, change all the color names to 3-digit color codes without affecting the result.
- Solution

  - : The following values are reasonable approximations of the named colors:

    ```css
    strong {
      color: #f00; /* red */
      background-color: #ddf; /* pale blue */
      font: 200% serif;
    }

    .carrot {
      color: #fa0; /* orange */
    }

    .spinach {
      color: #080; /* dark green */
    }

    p {
      color: #00f; /* blue */
    }
    ```

## Content

The challenges on page are:

### Add an image

- Challenge
  - : Add a one rule to your stylesheet so that it displays the image at the start of each line.
- Solution

  - : Add this rule to your stylesheet:

    ```css
    p:before{
      content: url("yellow-pin.png");
    }
    ```

## Lists

The challenges on page [Lists](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Styling_lists) are:

### Lower Roman numerals

- Challenge
  - : Add a rule to your stylesheet, to number the oceans using Roman numerals from i to v.
- Solution

  - : Define a rule for list items to use the `lower-roman` list style:

    ```css
    li {
      list-style: lower-roman;
    }
    ```

### Capital letters

- Challenge
  - : Change your stylesheet to identify the headings with capital letters in parentheses.
- Solution

  - : Add a rule to the body element (parent of the headings) to reset a new counter, and one to display and increment the counter on the headings:

    ```css
    /* numbered headings */
    body {counter-reset: headnum;}
    h3:before {
      content: "(" counter(headnum, upper-latin) ") ";
      counter-increment: headnum;
    }
    ```

## Boxes

The challenges on page [Boxes](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks) are:

### Ocean border

- Challenge
  - : Add one rule to your stylesheet, making a wide border all around the oceans in a color that reminds you of the sea.
- Solution

  - : The following rule achieves this effect:

    ```css
    ul {
      border: 10px solid lightblue;
      width:  100px;
    }
    ```

## Layout

The challenges on page [Layout](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout) are:

### Default image position

### Fixed image position

- Challenge
  - : Change your sample document, `doc2.html`, adding this tag to it near the end, just before `</BODY>`: `<IMG id="fixed-pin" src="Yellow-pin.png" alt="Yellow map pin">` Predict where the image will appear in your document. Then refresh your browser to see if you were correct.
- Solution
  - : The image appears to the right of the second list.
    ![](pin_placement.png)
- Challenge
  - : Add a rule to your stylesheet that places the image in the top right of your document.
- Solution

  - : The following rule achieves the desired result:

        #fixed-pin  {
          position:fixed;
          top: 3px;
          right: 3px;
        }

## Tables

The challenges on page [Tables](/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Styling_tables) are:

### Borders on data cells only

- Challenge
  - : Change the stylesheet to make the table have a green border around only the data cells.
- Solution

  - : The following rule puts borders around only {{ HTMLElement("td") }} elements that are inside the {{ HTMLElement("tbody") }} element of the table with `id=demo-table`:

        #demo-table tbody td {
          border:1px solid #7a7;
        }

## Media

The challenges on page [Media](/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Responsive/Media_types) are:

### Separate print style file

- Challenge
  - : Move the print-specific style rules to a separate CSS file and import them into your `style4.css` stylesheet.
- Solution

  - : Cut and paste the lines between `/* print only */` and `/* end print only */` into a file named `style4_print.css`. In style4.css, add the following line at the beginning of the file:

        @import url("style4_print.css") print;

### Heading hover color

- Challenge
  - : Make the headings turn blue when the mouse pointer is over them.
- Solution

  - : The following rule achieves the desired result:

        h1:hover {
          color: blue;
        }

## JavaScript

### Move box to the right

- Challenge
  - : Change the script so that the square jumps to the right by 20 em when its color changes, and jumps back afterwards.
- Solution

  - : Add lines to modify the `margin-left` property. Be sure to specify it as `marginLeft` in JavaScript. The following script achieves the desired result:

    ```js
    // JavaScript demonstration
    function doDemo (button) {
      var square = document.getElementById("square");
      square.style.backgroundColor = "#fa4";
      square.style.marginLeft = "20em";
      button.setAttribute("disabled", "true");
      setTimeout(clearDemo, 2000, button);
    }

    function clearDemo (button) {
      var square = document.getElementById("square");
      square.style.backgroundColor = "transparent";
      square.style.marginLeft = "0em";
      button.removeAttribute("disabled");
    }
    ```

## SVG and CSS

### Change color of inner petals

- Challenge
  - : Change the stylesheet so that the inner petals all turn pink when the mouse pointer is over any one of them, without changing the way the outer petals work.
- Solution

  - : Move the position of the :hover pseudo-class from a specific petal, to all petals

    ```css
    #inner-petals {
      --segment-fill-fill-hover: pink;
    }

    /* Non-standard way for some older browsers */
    #inner-petals:hover .segment-fill {
      fill: pink;
      stroke: none;
    }
    ```
