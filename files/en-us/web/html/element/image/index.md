{{HTMLSidebar}}{{deprecated_header}}{{Non-standard_header}}

The **`<image>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element is an ancient and poorly supported precursor to the {{HTMLElement("img")}} element.
**It should not be used**.

Some browsers will attempt to automatically convert this into an {{HTMLElement("img")}} element, and may succeed if the [`src`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#src) attribute is specified as well.

## Specifications

This does not appear to have been part of any formal specification.
It was mentioned in [HTML+ Discussion Document - Dave Raggett, November 8, 1993](https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/HTMLPlus/htmlplus_21.html) (Section 5.9 - Images), but was not part of the first revision of [HyperText Markup Language Specification - 2.0](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-html-spec-00) in 1994.
