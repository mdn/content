{{HTMLRef}}

The **`<col>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element defines a column within a table and is used for defining common semantics on all common cells. It is generally found within a {{HTMLElement("colgroup")}} element.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/tabbed/col.html","tabbed-taller")}}

`<col>` allows styling columns using CSS, but only a few properties will have an effect on the column ([see the CSS 2.1 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/tables.html#columns) for a list).

<table class="properties">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">
        <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories"
          >Content categories</a
        >
      </th>
      <td>None.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Permitted content</th>
      <td>None, it is an {{Glossary("empty element")}}.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Tag omission</th>
      <td>It must have start tag, but must not have an end tag.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Permitted parents</th>
      <td>
        {{HTMLElement("colgroup")}} only, though it can be implicitly
        defined as its start tag is not mandatory. The
        {{HTMLElement("colgroup")}} must not have a
        {{htmlattrxref("span", "colgroup")}} attribute.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Implicit ARIA role</th>
      <td>
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#dfn-no-corresponding-role"
          >No corresponding role</a
        >
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Permitted ARIA roles</th>
      <td>No <code>role</code> permitted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">DOM interface</th>
      <td>{{domxref("HTMLTableColElement")}}</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

- {{htmlattrdef("span")}}
  - : This attribute contains a positive integer indicating the number of consecutive columns the `<col>` element spans. If not present, its default value is `1`.

### Deprecated attributes

The following attributes are deprecated and should not be used. They are documented below for reference when updating existing code and for historical interest only.

- {{htmlattrdef("align")}} {{deprecated_inline}}

  - : This enumerated attribute specifies how horizontal alignment of each column cell content will be handled. Possible values are:

    - `left`, aligning the content to the left of the cell
    - `center`, centering the content in the cell
    - `right`, aligning the content to the right of the cell
    - `justify`, inserting spaces into the textual content so that the content is justified in the cell

    If this attribute is not set, its value is inherited from the {{htmlattrxref("align", "colgroup")}} of the {{HTMLElement("colgroup")}} element this `<col>` element belongs too. If there are none, the `left` value is assumed.

    > **Note:** To achieve the same effect as the `left`, `center`, `right` or `justify` values, do not try to set the {{cssxref("text-align")}} property on a selector giving a `<col>` element. Because {{HTMLElement("td")}} elements are not descendant of the `<col>` element, they won't inherit it.
    >
    > If the table doesn't use a {{htmlattrxref("colspan", "td")}} attribute, use the `td:nth-child(an+b)` CSS selector. Set `a` to zero and `b `to the position of the column in the table, e.g. `td:nth-child(2) { text-align: right; }` to right-align the second column.
    >
    > If the table does use a {{htmlattrxref("colspan", "td")}} attribute, the effect can be achieved by combining adequate CSS attribute selectors like `[colspan=n]`, though this is not trivial.

- {{htmlattrdef("bgcolor")}} {{Deprecated_inline}}

  - : The background color of the table. It is a [6-digit hexadecimal RGB code](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#rgb_colors), prefixed by a '`#`'. One of the predefined [color kewords](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#color_keywords) can also be used.

    To achieve a similar effect, use the CSS {{cssxref("background-color")}} property.

- {{htmlattrdef("char")}} {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : This attribute is used to set the character to align the cells in a column on. Typical values for this include a period (.) when attempting to align numbers or monetary values. If {{htmlattrxref("align", "col")}} is not set to `char`, this attribute is ignored.
- {{htmlattrdef("charoff")}} {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : This attribute is used to indicate the number of characters to offset the column data from the alignment characters specified by the `char` attribute.
- {{htmlattrdef("valign")}} {{deprecated_inline}}

  - : This attribute specifies the vertical alignment of the text within each cell of the column. Possible values for this attribute are:

    - `baseline`, which will put the text as close to the bottom of the cell as it is possible, but align it on the [baseline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseline_%28typography%29) of the characters instead of the bottom of them. If characters are all of the size, this has the same effect as `bottom`.
    - `bottom`, which will put the text as close to the bottom of the cell as it is possible;
    - `middle`, which will center the text in the cell;
    - and `top`, which will put the text as close to the top of the cell as it is possible.

    > **Note:** Do not try to set the {{cssxref("vertical-align")}} property on a selector giving a `<col>` element. Because {{HTMLElement("td")}} elements are not descendant of the `<col>` element, they won't inherit it.
    >
    > If the table doesn't use a {{htmlattrxref("colspan", "td")}} attribute, use the `td:nth-child(an+b)` CSS selector where a is the total number of the columns in the table and b is the ordinal position of the column in the table. Only after this selector the `vertical-align` property can be used.
    >
    > If the table does use a {{htmlattrxref("colspan", "td")}} attribute, the effect can be achieved by combining adequate CSS attribute selectors like `[colspan=n]`, though this is not trivial.

- {{htmlattrdef("width")}} {{deprecated_inline}}
  - : This attribute specifies a default width for each column in the current column group. In addition to the standard pixel and percentage values, this attribute might take the special form `0*`, which means that the width of each column in the group should be the minimum width necessary to hold the column's contents. Relative widths such as `5*` also can be used.

## Examples

- CSS properties and pseudo-classes that may be specially useful to style the `<col>` element:

  - the {{cssxref("width")}} property to control the width of the column;
  - the {{cssxref(":nth-child")}} pseudo-class to set the alignment on the cells of the column;
  - the {{cssxref("text-align")}} property to align all cells content on the same character, like '.'.
