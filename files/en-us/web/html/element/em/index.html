<h2 id="Usage_notes">Usage notes</h2>

<p>The <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> element is for words that have a stressed emphasis compared to surrounding text, which is often limited to a word or words of a sentence and affects the meaning of the sentence itself.</p>

<p>Typically this element is displayed in italic type. However, it should not be used to apply italic styling; use the CSS {{cssxref("font-style")}} property for that purpose. Use the {{HTMLElement("cite")}} element to mark the title of a work (book, play, song, etc.). Use the {{HTMLElement("i")}} element to mark text that is in an alternate tone or mood, which covers many common situations for italics such as scientific names or words in other languages. Use the {{HTMLElement("strong")}} element to mark text that has greater importance than surrounding text.</p>

<h3 id="&lt;i&gt;_vs._&lt;em&gt;">&lt;i&gt; vs. &lt;em&gt;</h3>

<p>New developers are often confused at seeing multiple elements that produce similar results. <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> are a common example, since they both italicize text. What's the difference? Which should you use?</p>

<p>By default, the visual result is the same. However, the semantic meaning is different. The <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> element represents stress emphasis of its contents, while the <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> element represents text that is set off from the normal prose, such a foreign word, fictional character thoughts, or when the text refers to the definition of a word instead of representing its semantic meaning. (The title of a work, such as the name of a book or movie, should use <code>&lt;cite&gt;</code>.)</p>

<p>This means the right one to use depends on the situation. Neither is for purely decorative purposes, that's what CSS styling is for.</p>

<p>An example for <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> could be: "Just <em>do</em> it already!", or: "We <em>had</em> to do something about it". A person or software reading the text would pronounce the words in italics with an emphasis, using verbal stress.</p>

<p>An example for <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> could be: "The <em>Queen Mary</em> sailed last night". Here, there is no added emphasis or importance on the word "Queen Mary". It is merely indicated that the object in question is not a queen named Mary, but a ship named <em>Queen Mary</em>. Another example for <code>&lt;i&gt;</code> could be: "The word <em>the</em> is an article".</p>

<p>The <code>&lt;em&gt;</code> element is often used to indicate an implicit or explicit contrast.</p>

  In HTML 5, what was previously called
  &lt;em&gt;block-level&lt;/em&gt; content is now called
  &lt;em&gt;flow&lt;/em&gt; content.
