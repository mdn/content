{{HTMLSidebar}}

The **`<picture>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element contains zero or more {{HTMLElement("source")}} elements and one {{HTMLElement("img")}} element to offer alternative versions of an image for different display/device scenarios.

The browser will consider each child `<source>` element and choose the best match among them. If no matches are found—or the browser doesn't support the `<picture>` element—the URL of the `<img>` element's [`src`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#src) attribute is selected. The selected image is then presented in the space occupied by the `<img>` element.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/tabbed/picture.html", "tabbed-standard")}}

To decide which URL to load, the {{Glossary("user agent")}} examines each `<source>`'s [`srcset`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source#srcset), [`media`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source#media), and [`type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source#type) attributes to select a compatible image that best matches the current layout and capabilities of the display device.

The `<img>` element serves two purposes:

1. It describes the size and other attributes of the image and its presentation.
2. It provides a fallback in case none of the offered `<source>` elements are able to provide a usable image.

Common use cases for `<picture>`:

- **Art direction.** Cropping or modifying images for different `media` conditions (for example, loading a simpler version of an image which has too many details, on smaller displays).
- **Offering alternative image formats**, for cases where certain formats are not supported.

  > **Note:** For example, newer formats like [AVIF](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#avif_image) or [WEBP](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types#webp_image) have many advantages, but might not be supported by the browser. A list of supported image formats can be found in: [Image file type and format guide](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types).

- **Saving bandwidth and speeding page load times** by loading the most appropriate image for the viewer's display.

If providing higher-density versions of an image for high-DPI (Retina) display, use [`srcset`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#srcset) on the `<img>` element instead. This lets browsers opt for lower-density versions in data-saving modes, and you don't have to write explicit `media` conditions.

## Attributes

This element includes only [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

## Usage notes

You can use the {{cssxref("object-position")}} property to adjust the positioning of the image within the element's frame, and the {{cssxref("object-fit")}} property to control how the image is resized to fit within the frame.

> **Note:** Use these properties on the child `<img>` element, **not** the `<picture>` element.

## Examples

These examples demonstrate how different attributes of the {{HTMLElement("source")}} element change the selection of the image inside `<picture>`.

### The media attribute

The `media` attribute specifies a media condition (similar to a media query) that the user agent will evaluate for each {{HTMLElement("source")}} element.

If the {{HTMLElement("source")}}'s media condition evaluates to `false`, the browser skips it and evaluates the next element inside `<picture>`.

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="mdn-logo-wide.png" media="(min-width: 600px)" />
  <img src="mdn-logo-narrow.png" alt="MDN" />
</picture>
```

### The srcset attribute

The [srcset](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source#srcset) attribute is used to offer list of possible images _based on size_.

It is composed of a comma-separated list of image descriptors. Each image descriptor is composed of a URL of the image, and _either_:

- a _width descriptor_, followed by a `w` (such as `300w`);
  _OR_
- a _pixel density descriptor_, followed by an `x` (such as `2x`) to serve a high-res image for high-DPI screens.

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="logo-768.png, logo-768-1.5x.png 1.5x" />
  <img src="logo-320.png" alt="logo" />
</picture>
```

### The type attribute

The `type` attribute specifies a [MIME type](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types) for the resource URL(s) in the {{HTMLElement("source")}} element's `srcset` attribute. If the user agent does not support the given type, the {{HTMLElement("source")}} element is skipped.

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="photo.avif" type="image/avif" />
  <source srcset="photo.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <img src="photo.jpg" alt="photo" />
</picture>
```
