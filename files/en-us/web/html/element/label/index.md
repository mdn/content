{{HTMLSidebar}}

The **`<label>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) element represents a caption for an item in a user interface.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/tabbed/label.html", "tabbed-shorter")}}

Associating a `<label>` with a form control, such as {{htmlelement("input")}} or {{htmlelement("textarea")}} offers some major advantages:

- The label text is not only visually associated with its corresponding text input; it is programmatically associated with it too. This means that, for example, a screen reader will read out the label when the user is focused on the form input, making it easier for an assistive technology user to understand what data should be entered.
- When a user clicks or touches/taps a label, the browser passes the focus to its associated input (the resulting event is also raised for the input). That increased hit area for focusing the input provides an advantage to anyone trying to activate it — including those using a touch-screen device.

To explicitly associate a `<label>` element with an `<input>` element, you first need to add the `id` attribute to the `<input>` element. Next, you add the `for` attribute to the `<label>` element, where the value of `for` is the same as the `id` in the `<input>` element.

Alternatively, you can nest the `<input>` directly inside the `<label>`, in which case the `for` and `id` attributes are not needed because the association is implicit:

```html
<label>
  Do you like peas?
  <input type="checkbox" name="peas" />
</label>
```

The form control that a label is labeling is called the _labeled control_ of the label element. Multiple labels can be associated with the same form control:

```html
<label for="username">Enter your username:</label>
<input id="username" name="username" type="text" />
<label for="username">Forgot your username?</label>
```

Elements that can be associated with a `<label>` element include {{HTMLElement('button')}}, {{HTMLElement('input')}} (except for `type="hidden"`), {{HTMLElement('meter')}}, {{HTMLElement('output')}}, {{HTMLElement('progress')}}, {{HTMLElement('select')}} and {{HTMLElement('textarea')}}.

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes).

- `for`

  - : The value of the `for` attribute must be a single [`id`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes#id) for a [labelable](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Content_categories#labelable) form-related element in the same document as the `<label>` element. So, any given `label` element can be associated with only one form control.

    > **Note:** To programmatically set the `for` attribute, use [`htmlFor`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLLabelElement/htmlFor).

    The first element in the document with an `id` attribute matching the value of the `for` attribute is the _labeled control_ for this `label` element — if the element with that `id` is actually a [labelable element](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#category-label). If it is _not_ a labelable element, then the `for` attribute has no effect. If there are other elements that also match the `id` value, later in the document, they are not considered.

    Multiple `label` elements can be given the same value for their `for` attribute; doing so causes the associated form control (the form control that `for` value references) to have multiple labels.

    > **Note:** A `<label>` element can have both a `for` attribute and a contained control element, as long as the `for` attribute points to the contained control element.

## Styling with CSS

There are no special styling considerations for `<label>` elements — structurally they are simple inline elements, and so can be styled in much the same way as a {{htmlelement("span")}} or {{htmlelement("a")}} element. You can apply styling to them in any way you want, as long as you don't cause the text to become difficult to read.

## Examples

### Defining an implicit label

```html
<label>Click me <input type="text" /></label>
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Simple_label_example', '200', '50', '')}}

### Defining an explicit label with the "for" attribute

```html
<label for="username">Click me to focus on the input field</label>
<input type="text" id="username" />
```

{{EmbedLiveSample('Using_the_for_attribute', '200', '50', '')}}

## Accessibility concerns

### Interactive content

Don't place interactive elements such as {{HTMLElement("a", "anchors")}} or {{HTMLElement("button", "buttons")}} inside a `label`. Doing so makes it difficult for people to activate the form input associated with the `label`.

#### Don't

```html example-bad
<label for="tac">
  <input id="tac" type="checkbox" name="terms-and-conditions" />
  I agree to the <a href="terms-and-conditions.html">Terms and Conditions</a>
</label>
```

#### Do

```html example-good
<label for="tac">
  <input id="tac" type="checkbox" name="terms-and-conditions" />
  I agree to the Terms and Conditions
</label>
<p>
  <a href="terms-and-conditions.html">Read our Terms and Conditions</a>
</p>
```

### Headings

Placing [heading elements](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements) within a `<label>` interferes with many kinds of assistive technology, because headings are commonly used as [a navigation aid](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Heading_Elements#navigation). If the label's text needs to be adjusted visually, use CSS classes applied to the `<label>` element instead.

If a [form](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form), or a section of a form needs a title, use the {{HTMLElement("legend")}} element placed within a {{HTMLElement("fieldset")}}.

#### Don't

```html example-bad
<label for="your-name">
  <h3>Your name</h3>
  <input id="your-name" name="your-name" type="text" />
</label>
```

#### Do

```html example-good
<label class="large-label" for="your-name">
  Your name
  <input id="your-name" name="your-name" type="text" />
</label>
```

### Buttons

An {{HTMLElement("input")}} element with a `type="button"` declaration and a valid `value` attribute does not need a label associated with it. Doing so may actually interfere with how assistive technology parses the button input. The same applies for the {{HTMLElement("button")}} element.
