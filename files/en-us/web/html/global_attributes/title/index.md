{{HTMLSidebar("Global_attributes")}}

The **`title`** [global attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes) contains text representing advisory information related to the element it belongs to.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/tabbed/attribute-title.html","tabbed-shorter")}}

The main use of the `title` attribute is to label {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} elements for assistive technology.

The `title` attribute may also be used to label controls in [data tables](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/table).

The `title` attribute, when added to [`<link rel="stylesheet">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link), creates an alternate stylesheet. When defining an alternative style sheet with `<link rel="alternate">` the attribute is required and must be set to a non-empty string.

If included on the {{htmlelement('abbr')}} opening tag, the `title` must be a full expansion of the abbreviation or acronym. Instead of using `title`, when possible, provide an expansion of the abbreviation or acronym in plain text on first use, using the `<abbr>` to mark up the abbreviation. This enables all users know what name or term the abbreviation or acronym shortens while providing a hint to user agents on how to announce the content.

While `title` can be used to provide a programmatically associated label for an {{HTMLElement("input")}} element, this is not good practice. Use a {{HTMLElement("label")}} instead.

## Multiline titles

The `title` attribute may contain several lines. Each `U+000A LINE FEED` (`LF`) character represents a line break. Some caution must be taken, as this means the following renders across two lines:

### HTML

```html
<p>
  Newlines in <code>title</code> should be taken into account, like
  <span title="This is a
multiline title" >example</span>.
</p>
```

### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample('Multiline_titles')}}

## Title attribute inheritance

If an element has no `title` attribute, then it inherits it from its parent node, which in turn may inherit it from its parent, and so on.

If this attribute is set to the empty string, it means its ancestors' `title`s are irrelevant and shouldn't be used in the tooltip for this element.

### HTML

```html
<div title="CoolTip">
  <p>Hovering here will show "CoolTip".</p>
  <p title="">Hovering here will show nothing.</p>
</div>
```

### Result

{{EmbedLiveSample('Title_attribute_inheritance')}}

## Accessibility concerns

Use of the `title` attribute is highly problematic for:

- People using touch-only devices
- People navigating with keyboards
- People navigating with assistive technology such as screen readers or magnifiers
- People experiencing fine motor control impairment
- People with cognitive concerns

This is due to inconsistent browser support, compounded by the additional assistive technology parsing of the browser-rendered page. If a tooltip effect is desired, it is better to [use a more accessible technique](https://inclusive-components.design/tooltips-toggletips/) that can be accessed with the above browsing methods.
