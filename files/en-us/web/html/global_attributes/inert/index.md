{{HTMLSidebar("Global_attributes")}}

The **`inert`** [global attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes) instructs the browser to disregard input events sent by the user, including focus-related events, as well as events generated by assistive technologies.

Specifically, it prevents the following actions to happens:

- It prevents the {{domxref("Element/click_event", "click")}} event from being thrown when the user clicks on the element.
- It prevents the {{domxref("Element/focus_event", "focus")}} event to be raised, by preventing the focus to be given to the element.
- It hides the element and its content from assistive technologies by excluding them from the accessibility tree.
