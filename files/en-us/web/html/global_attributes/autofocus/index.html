<p><span class="seoSummary">The <strong><code>autofocus</code></strong> <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes">global attribute</a> is a Boolean attribute indicating that an element should be focused on page load, or when the {{HTMLElement("dialog")}} that it is part of is displayed.</span></p>

<pre class="brush: html">&lt;input name="q" autofocus&gt;</pre>

<p>No more than one element in the document or dialog may have the autofocus attribute. If applied to multiple elements the first one will receive focus.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
  <h4>Note:</h4>
  <p>The <code>autofocus</code> attribute applies to all elements, not just form controls. For example, it might be used on a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable">contenteditable</a> area.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Accessibility_considerations">Accessibility considerations</h2>

<p>Automatically focusing a form control can confuse visually-impaired people using screen-reading technology and people with cognitive impairments. When <code>autofocus</code> is assigned, screen-readers "teleport" their user to the form control without warning them beforehand.</p>

<p>Use careful consideration for accessibility when applying the <code>autofocus</code> attribute. Automatically focusing on a control can cause the page to scroll on load. The focus can also cause dynamic keyboards to display on some touch devices. While a screen reader will announce the label of the form control receiving focus, the screen reader will not announce anything before the label, and the sighted user on a small device will equally miss the context created by the preceding content.</p>
