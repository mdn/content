{{HTMLSidebar("Global_attributes")}}

The **`contenteditable`** [global attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes) is an enumerated attribute indicating if the element should be editable by the user. If so, the browser modifies its widget to allow editing.

{{EmbedInteractiveExample("pages/tabbed/attribute-contenteditable.html","tabbed-shorter")}}

The attribute must take one of the following values:

- `true` or an _empty string_, which indicates that the element is editable.
- `false`, which indicates that the element is not editable.

If the attribute is given without a value, like `<label contenteditable>Example Label</label>`, its value is treated as an empty string.

If this attribute is missing or its value is invalid, its value is _inherited_ from its parent element: so the element is editable if its parent is editable.

Note that although its allowed values include `true` and `false`, this attribute is an _[enumerated](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Enumerated)_ one and not a _Boolean_ one.

You can set the color used to draw the text insertion {{Glossary("caret")}} with the CSS {{cssxref("caret-color")}} property.

Elements that are made editable, and therefore interactive, by using the `contenteditable` attribute can be focused. They participate in sequential keyboard navigation. However, elements with the `contenteditable` attribute nested within other `contenteditable` elements are not added to the tabbing sequence by default. You can add the nested `contenteditable` elements to the keyboard navigation sequence by specifying the `tabindex` value ([`tabindex="0"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex)).
