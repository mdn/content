The `<blockquote>` HTML element represents a **section of content that is a quotation from another source**. It is generally displayed as an indented block and is used for **longer quotations**.

This article explains the main features of `<blockquote>` and shows how to use it effectively.
## Content and structure

A `<blockquote>` can contain **any block-level content**, including paragraphs, lists, and other elements. The source of the quotation is usually cited using `<p>` and `<cite>`.

Example:

```html live-sample___blockquote-basic
<div>
  <blockquote cite="https://www.huxley.net/bnw/four.html">
    <p>
      Words can be like X-rays, if you use them properly—they’ll go through
      anything. You read and you’re pierced.
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>—Aldous Huxley, <cite>Brave New World</cite></p>
</div>
```

## `cite` attribute

The `cite` attribute provides the URL or reference of the source. It **does not affect the visual rendering**, but is useful for semantics and accessibility.

Example:

```html live-sample___blockquote-cite
<div>
  <blockquote cite="https://example.com/famous-quote">
    <p>"Practice makes perfect."</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>—Example Author, <cite>Example Work</cite></p>
</div>
```

## Best practices

- Use `<blockquote>` only for **quotations from other sources**.
- Combine `<blockquote>` with `<p>` for authorship and `<cite>` for the work’s title.
- Avoid using `<blockquote>` purely for visual indentation; use CSS for styling instead.
- For short inline quotations, prefer `<q>` instead of `<blockquote>`.

Summary:
- `<blockquote>`: long quotations.
- `<q>`: short inline quotations.
- `cite`: URL of the source.
- `<p>`: paragraph of quote or author.
- `<div>`: container block.
- `<cite>`: title of the work.
