{{SeeCompatTable}}

The **`<selectedcontent>`** [HTML](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) is used inside a {{htmlelement("select")}} element to display the contents of its currently selected {{htmlelement("option")}} within its first child {{htmlelement("button")}}. This enables you to style all parts of a `<select>` element, referred to as "[customizable selects](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Forms/Customizable_select)".

## Attributes

This element includes the [global attributes](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes).

## Description

You use the `<selectedcontent>` element as the only child of a {{htmlelement("button")}} element, which must be the first child of the {{htmlelement("select")}} element. Any {{htmlelement("option")}} element, the only other valid child of `<select>`, must come after the `<button>` and nested `<selectedcontent>` pair.

```html
<select>
  <button>
    <selectedcontent></selectedcontent>
  </button>
  <option></option>
  ...
</select>
```

### How `<selectedcontent>` works behind the scenes

The `<selectedcontent>` element contains a clone of the content of the currently selected {{htmlelement("option")}}. The browser renders this clone using {{domxref("Node.cloneNode", "cloneNode()")}}. When the selected `<option>` changes, such as during a [`change`](HTMLElement/change_event) event, the contents of `<selectedcontent>` are replaced with a clone of the newly selected `<option>`. Being aware of this behavior is important, especially when working with dynamic content.

> [!WARNING]
> Since the browser updates `<selectedcontent>` only when the selected `<option>` changes, any dynamic modifications to the content of the selected `<option>` after the `<select>` is rendered won't be cloned to `<selectedcontent>`. You'll need to update `<selectedcontent>` manually. Watch out if you're using any of the popular front-end JavaScript frameworks where `<option>` elements are updated dynamically after the initial render–the result may not match what you expect in `<selectedcontent>`.

### `<selectedcontent>` inertness

By default, any `<button>` inside a `<select>` element is [inert](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/inert). As a result, all content inside that button—including `<selectedcontent>`—is also inert.
This means users can't interact with or focus on content inside `<selectedcontent>`.

### Styling the selected option's content with CSS

You can target the content of the currently selected `<option>` element and style how it appears inside the select button. Styling the button doesn't affect the styling of the content of the `<option>` that was cloned. This lets you customize how the selected option appears in the button, separately from how it appears in the drop-down list.

For example, your `<option>` elements may contain icons, images, or even videos that render nicely inside the drop-down, but could cause the select `<button>` to increase in size, look untidy, and affect the surrounding layout. By targeting the content inside `<selectedcontent>`, you can hide elements such as images in the button, without affecting how they appear in the drop-down, as shown in the following snippet:

```css
selectedcontent img {
  display: none;
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the `<button>` and/or `<selectedcontent>` elements are not included inside `<select>`, the browser creates an implicit `<button>` to display the contents of the selected `<option>`. This fallback button cannot be targeted with CSS using the `button` or `selectedcontent` type selector.
