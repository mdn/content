The **`compression-dictionary`** keyword for the [`rel`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/link#rel) attribute of the {{HTMLElement("link")}} element is a link that browsers can use to download a {{glossary("Compression dictionary transport", "compression dictionary")}} that can be used to compress future downloads for resources on this site so the download sizes of those resources are smaller than standard compression.

See the [Compression Dictionary Transport guide](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Compression_dictionary_transport) for more information.
