{{HTMLSidebar}}

The **`prefetch`** keyword for the {{HTMLAttrxRef("rel", "link")}} attribute of the {{HTMLElement("link")}} element is a hint to browsers that the user is likely to need the target resource for future navigations, and therefore the browser can likely improve the user experience by preemptively fetching and caching the resource.
