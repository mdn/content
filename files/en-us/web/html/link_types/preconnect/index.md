{{HTMLSidebar}}

The **`preconnect`** keyword for the {{HTMLAttrxRef("rel", "link")}} attribute of the {{HTMLElement("link")}} element is a hint to browsers that the user is likely to need resources from the target resource's origin, and therefore the browser can likely improve the user experience by preemptively initiating a connection to that origin.

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://example.com">
```
