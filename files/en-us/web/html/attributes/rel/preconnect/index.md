{{HTMLSidebar}}

The **`preconnect`** keyword for the [`rel`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#rel) attribute of the {{HTMLElement("link")}} element is a hint to browsers that the user is likely to need resources from the target resource's origin, and therefore the browser can likely improve the user experience by preemptively initiating a connection to that origin. Preconnecting speeds up future loads from a given origin by preemptively performing part or all of the handshake (DNS+TCP for HTTP, and DNS+TCP+TLS for HTTPS origins).

`<link rel="preconnect">` will provide a benefit to any future cross-origin HTTP request, navigation or subresource. It has no benefit on same-origin requests because the connection is already open.

If a page needs to make connections to many third-party domains, preconnecting them all can be counterproductive. The `<link rel="preconnect">` hint is best used for only the most critical connections. For the others, just use [`<link rel="dns-prefetch">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/dns-prefetch) to save time on the first step â€” the DNS lookup.

## Examples

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://example.com" />
```

You can also implement preconnect as an HTTP [Link](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Link) header, for example:

```http
Link: <https://example.com>; rel="preconnect"
```
