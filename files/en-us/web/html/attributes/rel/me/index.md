{{HTMLSidebar}}

The **`me`** keyword for the [`rel`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/link#rel) attribute of the {{HTMLElement("link")}} and {{HTMLElement("a")}} elements indicates that the current resource is represented by the linked party. The `me` value was introduced in the [XHTML Friends Network (XFN) specification](https://gmpg.org/xfn/).

```html
<link rel="me" value="example.com" />
```

The `rel="me"` attribute is used in [RelMeAuth](https://microformats.org/wiki/RelMeAuth) and [Web sign in](https://microformats.org/wiki/web-sign-in) specifications as a way to enable a person to identify themselves to a web service using their domain name or a particular URL.
