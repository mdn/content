A **secure context** is a `Window` or `Worker` for which certain minimum standards of authentication and confidentiality are met. Many Web APIs and features are accessible only in a secure context. The primary goal of secure contexts is to prevent {{interwiki("wikipedia", "man-in-the-middle attack", "MITM attackers")}} from accessing powerful APIs that could further compromise the victim of an attack.

## Why should some features be restricted?

Some APIs on the web are very powerful, giving an attacker the ability to do the following and more:

- Invade a user's privacy.
- Get low-level access to a user's computer.
- Get access to data such as user credentials.

## When is a context considered secure?

A context is considered secure when it meets certain minimum standards of authentication and confidentiality defined in the [Secure Contexts](https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-secure-contexts/) specification. A particular document is considered to be in a secure context when it is the [active document](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#active-document) of a [top-level browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/browsers.html#top-level-browsing-context) (basically, a containing window or tab) that is a secure context.

For example, even for a document delivered over TLS within an {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}, its context is **not** considered secure if it has an ancestor that was not also delivered over TLS.

However, it’s important to note that if a non-secure context causes a new window to be created (with or without specifying [noopener](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open)), then the fact that the opener was insecure has no effect on whether the new window is considered secure. That’s because the determination of whether or not a particular document is in a secure context is based only on considering it within the top-level browsing context with which it is associated — and not whether a non-secure context happened to be used to create it.

Locally-delivered resources such as those with _http\://127.0.0.1_ URLs, *http\://localhost* and  *http\://\*.localhost* URLs (e.g. _http\://dev.whatever.localhost/_), and _file://_ URLs are also considered to have been delivered securely.

> **Note:** Firefox 84 and later support *http\://localhost* and *http\://\*.localhost* URLs as trustworthy origins (earlier versions did not, because `localhost` was not guaranteed to map to a local/loopback address).

Resources that are not local, to be considered secure, must meet the following criteria:

- must be served over _https\://_ or _wss\://_ URLs
- the security properties of the network channel used to deliver the resource must not be considered deprecated

## Feature detection

Pages can use feature detection to check whether they are in a secure context or not by using the {{domxref("isSecureContext")}} boolean, which is exposed on the global scope.

```js
if (window.isSecureContext) {
  // Page is a secure context so service workers are now available
  navigator.serviceWorker.register("/offline-worker.js").then(function () {
    ...
  });
}
```
