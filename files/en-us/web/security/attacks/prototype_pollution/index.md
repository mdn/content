**Prototype pollution** is a vulnerability where an attacker can add or modify properties on an object's prototype. This means malicious values can unexpectedly appear on objects in your application, often leading to logic errors or additional attacks like [cross-site scripting (XSS)](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS).

## Prototypes in JavaScript

JavaScript implements {{glossary("inheritance")}} using _prototypes_. Each object has a reference to a prototype, which is itself an object, and which itself has a prototype, and so on, until we get to the fundamental prototype, which is called `Object.prototype`, whose own prototype is `null`.

If you try to access a property or call a method on an object, and that property or method isn't defined on the object, then the JavaScript runtime looks in the object's prototype for the property or method, and then in the object's prototype's prototype, and so on, until it finds the method or property, or reaches an object whose prototype is `null`.

That's why you can do this:

```js
const mySet = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
// prototype chain:
// mySet -> Set.prototype -> Object.prototype -> null

mySet.size;
// 3
// size is defined on the prototype of `mySet`, which is `Set.prototype`

mySet.propertyIsEnumerable("size");
// false
// propertyIsEnumerable() is defined on the prototype
// of `Set.prototype`, which is `Object.prototype`
```

Unlike many other languages, JavaScript allows you to add inherited properties and methods at runtime by modifying an object's prototypes:

```js example-bad
const mySet = new Set([1, 2, 3]);

// modify the Object prototype at runtime
Object.prototype.extra = "new property from the Object prototype!";

// modify the Set prototype at runtime
Set.prototype.other = "new property from the Set prototype!";

mySet.extra;
// "new property from the Object prototype!"

mySet.other;
// "new property from the Set prototype!"
```

In a prototype pollution attack, the attacker changes a built-in prototype such as `Object.prototype`, causing all derived objects to have an extra property, including objects that the attacker doesn't have direct access to.

## Anatomy of prototype pollution

Prototype pollution involves two phases:

1. **Pollution**: The attacker is able to add or modify properties on an object's prototype.
2. **Exploitation**: Original application code accesses the polluted properties, leading to unexpected behavior.

### Pollution sources

In order to pollute objects, the attacker needs a way to add arbitrary properties to prototype objects. This may happen as a consequence of [XSS](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/XSS), in which the attacker gains direct access to the page's JavaScript execution environment. However, attackers with this level of access can do damage much more directly, so prototype pollution is usually discussed as a _data-only_ attack, where the attacker constructs a payload that is processed by the application code, leading to pollution.

A key attack vector is the [`__proto__`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/proto) property, which allows accessing the prototype object of an arbitrary object. You can also reach the prototype via `yourObject.constructor.prototype`. The key code pattern that is a pollution source is dynamic property modification of the following kind:

```js
obj[key1][key2] = value;
```

In this case, if `obj` is an ordinary object, `key1` is `"__proto__"`, and `key2` is some property name such as `"test"`, then the code adds a property called `test` to `Object.prototype`, which is the prototype of all ordinary objects. Even if the [`"__proto__"` setter is disabled](#node.js_flag_--disable-proto), the `.constructor.prototype` access pattern can still be used to reach the prototype, which is also `Object.prototype` for ordinary objects:

```js
obj[key1][key2][key3] = value;
```

...where `key1` is `"constructor"`, `key2` is `"prototype"`, and `key3` is some property name such as `"test"`.

To put this line into more context, `key1`, `key2`, and `key3` may be attacker-controlled values. For example, imagine an API endpoint that takes a list of user names, and a list of fields to query for each user, and returns an object mapping each user name to their fields:

```js
function getUsers(request) {
  const result = {};
  const userNames = new URL(request.url).searchParams.getAll("names");
  const fields = new URL(request.url).searchParams.getAll("fields");
  for (const name of userNames) {
    const userInfo = database.lookup(name);
    result[name] ??= {};
    for (const field of fields) {
      // Pollution source
      result[name][field] = userInfo[field];
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

Now, if the attacker calls this API with the URL `https://example.com/api?names=__proto__&fields=age`, the code will add a property called `age` to `Object.prototype`, with the value being whatever the `age` property of the `__proto__` user is. It may be `undefined`, but if the attacker can add a user called `__proto__` to the database (e.g., via a separate API call), they can control the value of the `age` property.

Many libraries that do [custom parsing of the URL query strings](https://github.com/BlackFan/client-side-prototype-pollution) are particularly vulnerable, because they allow specifying deep object structures via the query string, and then use dynamic property modification to build the object, such as `?__proto__[test]=test` or `?__proto__.test=test`. Libraries in general are more vulnerable than application code, because they cannot allowlist valid keys, and they often need to use dynamic property modification to be generic.

Note that in [JSON](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON), the `__proto__` property is just a normal property name, so parsing JSON payloads like `{"__proto__": {"test": "value"}}` just creates an object with a property called `__proto__`, and is not immediately problematic. However, if later in the code, the object is merged into another object via {{jsxref("Object.assign()")}}, [`for...in` loops](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in), etc., then the implicit property assignment operation will trigger the setter. Usually, this does not actually modify `Object.prototype` because there's only one level of dynamic property access, but it does change the prototype of the target object. Note that [spreading](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) is not susceptible to this type of attack, because spreading does not trigger setters.

```js
// Just an object with a property called `__proto__`
const options = JSON.parse('{"__proto__": {"test": "value"}}');
const withDefaults = Object.assign({ mode: "cors" }, options);
// In the process of merging `options`, we indirectly executed
// withDefaults.__proto__ = { test: "value" }, causing `withDefaults` to have
// a different prototype
console.log(withDefaults.test); // "value"
```

### Exploitation targets

To see the effect of prototype pollution, we can look at the how the following {{domxref("fetch()")}} call can be changed completely. By default, it is a {{HTTPMethod("GET")}} request with no content to send to the server, but because we polluted the `Object.prototype` object with two new default properties, the `fetch()` call is now transformed into a {{HTTPMethod("POST")}} request and the request body now contains instructions for the server, for example to transfer an arbitrary amount of money to an arbitrary address:

```js
// Attacker indirectly causes the following pollution
Object.prototype.body = "action=transfer&amount=1337&to=1337-1337-1337-1337";
Object.prototype.method = "POST";

fetch("https://example.com", {
  mode: "cors",
});
// Promise {status: "pending", body: "action=transfer&amount=1337&to=1337-1337-1337-1337", method: "POST"}

// Any new object initialization is now modified to contain additional default properties
console.log({}.method); // "POST"
console.log({}.body); // "action=transfer&amount=1337&to=1337-1337-1337-1337"
```

Another dangerous pollution attack target is the {{domxref("HTMLIframeElement.srcdoc")}} property which specifies the content of an {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} element. By overriding its value, it could potentially be possible to execute arbitrary code.

```js
Object.prototype.srcdoc = "<script>alert(1)<\/script>";
```

Configuration objects, like `fetch()`'s {{domxref("RequestInit")}} object in the code example above, or the instantiation of `<iframes>`, or configuration of sanitizers ({{domxref("SanitizerConfig")}} objects), are some of the most sensitive objects and are often targets of prototype pollution attacks. Data objects can also be polluted:

```js
function accessDashboard(user) {
  if (!user.isAdmin) {
    return new Response("Access denied", { status: 403 });
  }
  // show admin page
}
```

If `Object.prototype.isAdmin` is set to `true`, and the `isAdmin` property is absent for non-admins instead of being set explicitly to `false`, then all users will be treated as admins, leading to a complete bypass of the access control.

## Defenses against prototype pollution

Defenses against prototype pollution go along two lines: avoiding code that may turn into prototype modifications, and avoiding accessing potentially polluted properties. This following section presents some strategies which you can use depending on your situation.

### Validate user input

Always validate user input with validators, such as [ajv](https://ajv.js.org) and [Zod](https://zod.dev/), to ensure that the input data structure contains the appropriate properties with the appropriate types. To mitigate the prototype pollution attack, reject unneeded properties by setting `additionalProperties` to `false` in the schema. Using a schema also allows setting default values for missing properties, which avoids prototype lookups.

You should avoid dynamic property modification (of the form `obj[key] = value`) unless you are able to validate the `key` values. If you are in this situation, you could rule out `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype` as keys in your validation.

### Node.js flag `--disable-proto`

If you are in a Node.js environment, you can disable `Object.prototype.__proto__` with the `--disable-proto=MODE` option where `MODE` is either `delete` (the property is removed entirely), or `throw` (accesses to the property throws an exception with the code `ERR_PROTO_ACCESS`). Use `delete Object.prototype.__proto__` in non-Node environments for the same effect.

This doesn't protect you from prototype pollution entirely (because `constructor.prototype` is still available), but it does remove one such entry point.

### Lock down built-in objects

High-sensitivity environments may implement a defense known as _realm lockdown_ which prevents any modifications to built-in objects. One example is the [SES](https://github.com/endojs/endo/tree/master/packages/ses#ses) shim for [Hardened JavaScript](https://hardenedjs.org). This is implemented based on the {{jsxref("Object.freeze()")}} function, which prevents extensions and makes existing properties non-writable and non-configurable. Freezing an object is the highest integrity level that JavaScript provides. Alternatively, {{jsxref("Object.seal()")}} allows existing properties changed, as long as they are writable, while {{jsxref("Object.preventExtensions()")}} prevents new properties from being added to an object.

```js
Object.freeze(Object.prototype);
const obj = {};
const key1 = "__proto__";
const key2 = "a";
obj[key1][key2] = 1; // fails silently in non-strict mode
obj.a; // undefined
```

However, note that legitimate prototype modifications may happen, usually to provide a {{glossary("Polyfill")}} implementation. In [non-strict mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode), attempts to modify a frozen object fail silently, while in strict mode, they throw a `TypeError`. To allow polyfills, the polyfill code needs to run before the freeze.

Another caveat with {{jsxref("Object.freeze()")}} is that it doesn't provide a deep freeze by default. If you want true immutability, you need to recursively freeze every property ([example](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze#deep_freezing)). A library like SES is preferable because it does a "walk" over all built-in objects, avoiding forgetting to freeze any object.

### Avoid lookups on the prototype

In code where you access the object's properties, make sure you know that the property exists on the object itself. You can perform an {{jsxref("Object.hasOwn()")}} check when you are accessing or traversing keys on objects.

Instead of:

```js example-bad
if (!user.isAdmin) {
  return new Response("Access denied", { status: 403 });
}
```

Consider:

```js
if (!Object.hasOwn(user, "isAdmin") || !user.isAdmin) {
  return new Response("Access denied", { status: 403 });
}
```

When iterating, the [`for...in`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) loop traverses the prototype. If possible, replace such loops with [`for...of`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) and {{jsxref("Object.keys()")}} to only visit own keys.

```js
// Looks up the prototype
for (const key in payload) {
  doSomething(payload[key]);
}

// Only visits own keys
for (const key of Object.keys(payload)) {
  doSomething(payload[key]);
}
```

In functions, explicitly set default parameters instead of leaving them undefined. This way, the default parameter values can be used instead of a potential lookup on the prototype chain. Instead of this:

```js example-bad
function doDangerousAction(options = {}) {
  if (!options.enableDangerousAction) {
    return;
  }
}
```

Consider this:

```js
function doDangerousAction(options = { enableDangerousAction: false }) {
  if (!options.enableDangerousAction) {
    return;
  }
}
```

### Create JavaScript objects with null prototype

[Null-prototype objects](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object#null-prototype_objects) simultaneously avoid prototype pollution (because the `__proto__` and `constructor` properties are not present on the object) and avoid lookups on the prototype. They are created either with the {{jsxref("Object.create()", "Object.create(null)")}} function, or with the `{ __proto__: null }` syntax in object initializers.

> [!NOTE]
> The `{ __proto__: null }` [prototype setter](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#prototype_setter) syntax in object initializers is fully secure, unlike the `obj.__proto__` accessor property.

If you need to pass an object as options (for example, because an API like `fetch()` requires you to use an object), create a null-prototype object. Note that creating objects without a prototype is not the default, so whenever instantiating an object, you need to remember to explicitly create a null-prototype object instead of the regular object initializer (`const myObj = {}`).

```js
Object.prototype.method = "POST";

// Still sends a GET request, because the object has no prototype
fetch("https://example.com", {
  __proto__: null,
  mode: "cors",
});
```

If you are creating an object that will be modified later (e.g., via `obj[key] = value`), create it as a null-prototype object:

```js
const result = { __proto__: null };
const key1 = "__proto__";
const key2 = "a";
result[key1] ??= {};
result[key1][key2] = 1; // modifies result, not Object.prototype
```

### Use `Map` and `Set` instead

When JavaScript objects are used as ad-hoc key-value pairs, consider using a {{jsxref("Map")}} or {{jsxref("Set")}} object instead. They also avoid object prototype pollution by avoiding object property modification or lookup. See the `Map` documentation for a [comparison between Maps and Objects](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map#objects_vs._maps). The {{jsxref("Map.prototype.get()")}} method always only returns entries within the `Map`.

```js
// Assume Object got polluted somehow
Object.prototype.admin = true;

const config = new Map();
config.set("admin", false);

config.admin; // true
config.get("admin"); // false
```

## Defense summary checklist

When creating objects:

- Evaluate if an object is needed or if a {{jsxref("Map")}} or {{jsxref("Set")}} would be the better choice.
- When passing objects to other functions, such as `FetchInit` or `SanitizerConfig`, either ensure that all keys are defined or use [null-prototype objects](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object#null-prototype_objects).
- When creating objects that will be dynamically modified later (e.g., via `obj[key] = value`), also create them as null-prototype objects.

When accepting user input, either via URL query strings, JSON payloads, or function parameters:

- Always validate user input with a schema validator. Reject unrecognized properties and set default values for missing properties.
- Functions that receive objects as parameters should either make sure all expected keys are defined on the object itself (by setting default values), or first check if the key exists on the object itself (e.g., via {{jsxref("Object.hasOwn()")}}) before accessing it.
- Prefer [`for...of`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of) and {{jsxref("Object.keys()")}} over [`for...in`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in) loops.

For built-in and third party objects:

- Consider freezing built-in and third party objects, for example by using the [SES](https://github.com/endojs/endo/tree/master/packages/ses#ses) shim.

Runtime defenses:

- Use `--disable-proto` in Node.js to disable `Object.prototype.__proto__`.
- Use `delete Object.prototype.__proto__` in non-Node environments.
