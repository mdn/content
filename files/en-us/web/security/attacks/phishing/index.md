Phishing is a social engineering attack which a user is tricked into believing that are interacting with a site with which they have an account, when in reality they are interacting with the attacker. The attacker convinces the user to enter their credentials on the fake site, and thereby steals the user's credentials.

## Overview

Phishing is a very old but still very common attack, which has gone through many variations, both to evade defenses and to take advantage of new vulnerabilities. In a basic form, though:

1. The attacker registers a domain name that resembles the target site. For example, if the user's banking website is `my-bank.example.com`, the attacker could register `my-bank-examp1e.com`.
2. The attacker creates a site at that address that resembles the real site.
3. The attacker sends the user an email, purporting to be from `my-bank.example.com`, giving some reason to ask the user to visit the site, and containing a link to the fake site `my-bank-examp1e.com`.
4. The user clicks the link and is asked to sign in. They enter their username and password, and the attacker now has their credentials.

Phishing attacks sometimes use different techniques to contact their victims, such as text messages or voice calls, and sometimes don't involve websites at all, convincing users to tell them passwords or PIN codes verbally.

Some phishing attacks are highly indiscriminate, sending out many messages to potential victims, in the hope that some will be tricked. In _spear-phishing_ attacks, on the other hand, attackers research specific victims, gathering personal information about them to make the lure more convincing. For example, the email may purport to come from someone the victim knows, and even include private information.

Phishing attacks are not dependent on naive or inexperienced users: decades of experience has shown that even highly experienced and knowlegeable users can be vulnerable to phishing attacks, especially when they are busy, tired, or distracted.

## Defenses

One thing that makes phishing challenging for a website to defend against is that the target site is not involved at all in the attack. It's entirely dependent on the user being tricked by the attacker. In this section we will discuss some practices that can help, but the only one that is really effective is using [passkeys](web_authentication_passkeys) instead of passwords.

### Password managers

Password managers can provide some degree of protection against phishing attacks. They fulfill three main functions:

- **Password generation**: Creating strong passwords when users sign up.
- **Password storage**: Storing a user's passwords securely, so the user doesn't have to remember them (and can therefore use stronger passwords)
- **Password entry**: Automatically entering the user's password for a site, when the user visits the site's login page.

It's the last of these that can help against phishing. The user might not see the difference between the fake domain `my-bank-examp1e.com` and the real domain `my-bank-example.com`, but the password manager will, and as a result it will not automatically enter the real password on the fake site. With luck, this will be enough of a warning to the user that the login request is not legitimate.

As a web developer, you can't make your users use a password manager. But you can, if you are not careful, make it impossible for password managers to integrate with your site. The article [Making password managers play ball with your login form](https://hidde.blog/making-password-managers-play-ball-with-your-login-form/) is an excellent summary of practices to follow, and practices to avoid, if you want users to be able to use password managers on your site. It's also important to test your site with password managers, both those built into browsers and popular standalone applications.

Unfortunately, users have been trained to expect tools to fail sometimes, and to work around their failures. So even if a user has a password manager, and it works with your site, and it does not auto-fill the password during a phishing attempt, you still have no guarantee that the user will not just paste the password in manually.

### Multi-factor authentication

Using {{glossary("multi-factor authentication", "multi-factor authentication (MFA)")}} to authenticate users makes phishing more difficult but, depending on the specific method used, does not prevent it.

In particular, in the most common MFA implementations, the user has to enter their password and another code, called a _one-time password_ (OTP), which is unique to this login attempt. Two common variants are:

- SMS-based OTP:
  - The user provides their cellphone number when they register.
  - After the user has supplied their username and password, the website sends an SMS to the user which contains an OTP.
  - The user enters the OTP.
  - If the OTP values match, the user is signed in.

- Time-based OTP (TOTP):
  - The user has an authenticator app installed.
  - After the user has supplied their username and password, the website calculates an OTP using the current time as input.
  - The user's authenticator does the same calculation, and the user enters the OTP that the app generated.
  - If the OTP values match, the user is signed in.

TOTP is considered more secure than SMS-based OTP, because it is possible for attackers to intercept SMS messages. However, from the point of view of phishing, both methods are vulnerable.

To phish a user who uses OTP as a second factor, the attacker's fake site is an active manipulator in the middle, between the user and the real site:

1. The attacker sends the user the email, containing the link to the fake site.
2. The user clicks the link in the email, and enters their username and password in the fake site.
3. The fake site relays the username and password to the real site.
4. The real site generates a TOTP.
5. The fake site asks the user to enter their TOTP.
6. The user's authenticator app generates the same TOTP, and the user enters it on the fake site.
7. The fake site relays the TOTP to the real site, and the attacker is given access.

This is much more difficult than just phishing a password, because the attacker must operate in real time. However, phishing toolkits greatly reduce the complexity of accomplishing it.

### Web Authentication (passkeys)

The strongest technical defense against phishing is to authenticate users with _passkeys_, which are based on the [Web Authentication API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API).

Unlike passwords or OTP codes, a user never manually enters a passkey on a site. When a web page asks the user to authenticate using Web Authentication, the browser finds applicable passkeys, and asks the user to authenticate themselves to the module on their device which manages the passkeys (for example using their fingerprint or a PIN). If this is successful, then the browser uses the passkey to sign into the site.

A passkey is specific to the {{glossary("origin")}} for which it was originally created. So if a passkey was created for the user's account at `my-bank.example.com`, the user will not be able to use it on `my-bank.examp1e.com` â€” the browser just won't consider it applicable to the fake site.

This means that passkeys are an effective defense against phishing.
