In a Manipulator in the Middle (MITM) attack, the attacker inserts themselves between two entities that are trying to communicating with each other.

On the web, an MITM attack generally takes place between the user's browser and the server, and enables the attacker to see and potentially modify any of the traffic exchanged over HTTP.

A common way for an attacker to execute an MITM attack is to set up a wireless access point in a public place, such as a cafe or an airport, and wait for a victim to connect to it. If a victim does connect, then the attacker will be able to read and modify any data exchanged between the user's browser and any sites they connect to.
