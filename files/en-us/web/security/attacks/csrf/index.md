In a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack, an attacker tricks the user or the browser into making an HTTP request to the target site from a malicious site. The request includes the user's credentials and causes the server to carry out some harmful action, thinking that the user intended it.

## Overview

A website typically performs special actions on a user's behalf — buying a product or making an appointment, for example — by receiving an HTTP request from the user's browser, often with parameters detailing the action to perform. To ensure that the request really comes from the user in question, the server expects the request to include {{glossary("Credential", "credentials")}} for the user: for example, a cookie containing the user's session ID.

In the example below, the user has previously signed into their bank, and the browser has stored a session cookie for the user. The page contains a {{htmlelement("form")}} element, which enables the user to transfer funds to another person. When the user submits the form, the browser sends a {{httpmethod("POST")}} request to the server, including the form data. If the user is signed in, the request includes the user's cookie. The server validates the cookie and performs the special action — in this case, transferring money:

In this guide, we'll call a request like this, that carries out some special action, a _state-changing request_.

In a CSRF attack, the attacker creates a website containing a form. The form's [`action` attribute](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#action) is set to the bank's website, and the form contains hidden input fields mimicking the bank's fields:

```html
<form action="https://my-bank.example.org/transfer" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="recipient" value="attacker" />
  <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000" />
</form>
```

The page also contains JavaScript that submits the form on page load:

```js
const form = document.querySelector("form");
form.submit();
```

When the user visits the page, the browser submits the form to the bank's website. Because the user is signed into their bank, the request may include the user's real cookie, so the bank's server successfully validates the request, and transfers the funds:

![Diagram showing a CSRF attack in which a decoy page submits a POST request to the website for the user's bank.](csrf-form-post.svg)

There are other ways the attacker could issue a cross-site request forgery. For example, if the website uses a {{httpmethod("GET")}} request to carry out the action, then the attacker can avoid having to use a form at all, and can execute the attack by sending the user a link to a page that contains markup like this:

```html
<img
  src="https://my-bank.example.org/transfer?recipient=attacker&amount=1000" />
```

When the user loads the page, the browser tries to fetch the image resource, which is really the transaction request.

In general, a CSRF attack is possible if your website:

- Uses HTTP requests to change some state on the server.
- Uses only cookies to validate that the request came from an authenticated user.
- Uses only parameters in the request that an attacker can predict.

## Defenses against CSRF

In this section we'll outline three alternative defenses against CSRF and a fourth practice which can be used to provide defense in depth for either of the others.

- The first primary defense is to [use _CSRF tokens_](#csrf_tokens) embedded in the page. This is the most common method if you're issuing state-changing requests from form elements, as in our example above.

- The second is to [use _Fetch metadata_](#fetch_metadata) HTTP headers to check whether or not the state-changing request is being issued cross-site.

- The third is to ensure that state-changing requests are [not _simple requests_](#avoiding_simple_requests), so that cross-origin requests are blocked by default. This method is appropriate if you're issuing state-changing requests from JavaScript APIs like {{domxref("Window.fetch()", "fetch()")}}.

Finally, we'll discuss [the `SameSite` cookie attribute](#defense_in_depth_samesite_cookies), which can be used to provide defense in depth alongside either of the previous methods.

### CSRF tokens

In this defense, when the server serves a page, it embeds an unpredictable value in the page, called the CSRF token. Then when the legitimate page sends the state-changing request to the server, it includes the CSRF token in the HTTP request. The server can then check the token value and carries out the request only if it matches. Because an attacker can't guess the token value, they can't issue a successful forgery. Even if the attacker does discover a token after it has been used, the request can't be replayed if the token changes every time.

For form submissions, the CSRF token is usually included in a hidden form field, so that on form submission it is automatically sent back to the server for checking.

For a JavaScript API like `fetch()`, the token might be placed in a cookie or embedded in the page, and the JavaScript extracts the value and sends it as an extra header.

Modern web frameworks usually have built-in support for CSRF tokens: for example, [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) enables you to protect forms using the [`csrf_token`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/csrf/) tag. This generates an additional hidden form field containing the token, which the framework then checks on the server.

To take advantage of this protection you must understand all the places in your website where you are using state-changing HTTP requests, and ensure you're using the defense provided by your chosen framework.

### Fetch metadata

Fetch metadata is a collection of HTTP request headers, added by the browser, that provide extra information about the context of an HTTP request. The server can use these headers to decide whether to allow a request or not.

Most relevant for CSRF is the {{httpheader("Sec-Fetch-Site")}} header, which tells the server whether this request is same-origin, same-site, cross-site, or initiated directly by the user. The server can use this information to allow cross-origin requests, or block them as potential CSRF attacks.

For example, this [Express](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions/Server-side/Express_Nodejs) code allows only same-site and same-origin requests:

```js
app.post("/transfer", (req, res) => {
  const secFetchSite = req.headers["sec-fetch-site"];
  if (secFetchSite === "same-origin" || secFetchSite === "same-site") {
    console.log("allowed");
    // Update state
  } else {
    console.log("denied");
    // Don't update state
  }
});
```

See {{glossary("Fetch metadata request header")}} for the complete list of Fetch metadata headers, and [Protect your resources from web attacks with Fetch Metadata](https://web.dev/articles/fetch-metadata) for a guide to using this feature.

### Avoiding simple requests

Web browsers distinguish two sorts of HTTP requests: [_simple_ requests](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS#simple_requests) and other requests.

Simple requests, which are the sort of request that result from a `<form>` element submission, can be made cross-origin without being blocked. Since forms have been able to make cross-origin requests since the early days of the web, it's important for compatibility that they should still be able to make cross-origin requests. This is why we need to implement other strategies to defend forms against CRSF, such as using a CSRF token.

However, other parts of the web platform, in particular JavaScript APIs like {{domxref("Window.fetch()", "fetch()")}}, can make different sorts of requests (for example, requests that set custom headers), and these requests are by default not allowed cross-origin, so a CSRF attack would not succeed.

So a website that uses `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest` can defend against CSRF by ensuring that the state-changing requests that it issues are never simple requests.

For example, setting the request's {{httpheader("Content-Type")}} to `"application/json"` will prevent it from being treated like a simple request:

```js
fetch("https://my-bank.example.org/transfer", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ recipient: "joe", amount: "100" }),
});
```

Similarly, setting a custom header on the request will prevent it being treated like a simple request:

```js
fetch("https://my-bank.example.org/transfer", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "X-MY-BANK-ANTI-CSRF": 1,
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({ recipient: "joe", amount: "100" }),
});
```

The header name can be anything, as long as it doesn't conflict with standard headers.

The server can then check for the existence of the header: if it exists, then the server knows that the request was not treated as a simple request.

#### Non-simple requests and CORS

We've said that non-simple requests are _by default_ not sent cross-origin. The catch is that the [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) protocol allows a website to relax this restriction.

Specifically, your website will be vulnerable to a CSRF attack from a particular origin if its response to a state-changing request includes:

- The {{httpheader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin")}} response header, and the header lists the sender's origin
- The {{httpheader("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials")}} response header.

### Defense in depth: SameSite cookies

The [`SameSite`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value) cookie attribute provides some protection against CSRF attacks. It's not a complete defense, and is best considered as an addition to one of the other defenses, providing some degree of defense in depth.

This attribute controls when a browser is allowed to include the cookie in a cross-site request. It has three possible values: `None`, `Lax` and `Strict`.

The `Strict` value offers the most protection: if this attribute is set, the browser will not include the cookie in any cross-site request. However, this creates a usability issue: if the user is logged into your site, and follows a link to your site from a different site, then your cookies will not be included, and the user will not be recognized when they reach your site.

The `Lax` value relaxes this restriction: cookies are included in cross-site requests if both the following conditions apply:

- The request was a navigation of the top-level browsing context.
- The request used a {{glossary("Safe/HTTP", "safe")}} method: notably, {{httpmethod("GET")}} is safe but {{httpmethod("POST")}} is not.

However, `Lax` offers significantly weaker protection than `Strict`:

- An attacker can trigger a top-level navigation. For example, at the start of this article we show a CSRF attack in which the attacker submits a form to the target: this is considered a top-level navigation. If the form were submitted using `GET`, then the request would still include cookies with `SameSite=Lax`.
- Even if the server does check that the request was not sent using `GET`, some web frameworks support "method override": this enables an attacker to send a request using `GET` but have it appear to the server as if it used `POST`.

As a general guide, then, you should try to use `Strict` for some cookies and `Lax` for others:

- `Lax` for cookies that you will use to decide if a logged-in user should be shown a page
- `Strict` for cookies that you will use for state-changing requests that you don't want to allow cross-site.

Another problem with the `SameSite` attribute is that it protects you from requests from a different {{glossary("Site", "site")}}, not a different {{glossary("Origin", "origin")}}. This is a looser protection, because (for example) `https://foo.example.org` and `https://bar.example.org` are considered the same site, although they are different origins. Effectively, if you rely on same-site protection, you have to trust all your site's subdomains.

See [Bypassing SameSite cookie restrictions](https://portswigger.net/web-security/csrf/bypassing-samesite-restrictions) for more details on the limitations of `SameSite`.

### Defense summary checklist

We can summarize the defenses above as follows:

- Understand where in your website you are implementing state-changing requests that use session cookies to check which user issued the request.
- Implement at least one of the primary defenses described in this document:
  - If you are using `<form>` elements to issue these requests, ensure you are using a web framework with support for CSRF tokens, and use it.
  - If you are using JavaScript APIs like `fetch()` or `XMLHttpRequest` to issue state-changing requests, ensure that they are not simple requests.
  - Whichever mechanism you use to issue requests, consider using Fetch metadata to disallow cross-site requests.
- Avoid using the `GET` method to issue state-changing requests.
- Set the `SameSite` attribute for session cookies to `Strict` if you can, or `Lax` if you have to.
