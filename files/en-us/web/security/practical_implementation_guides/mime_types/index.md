The [`X-Content-Type-Options`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Content-Type-Options) header informs browsers not to load scripts and stylesheets unless the server indicates the correct [MIME type](/en-US/docs/Glossary/MIME_type).

## Problem

Without proper MIME type verification, browsers might incorrectly detect non-script and non-stylesheet files as scripts or stylesheets. This error allows potentially malicious files to be loaded via {{htmlelement("script")}} and {{htmlelement("link")}} elements as part of Cross-site scripting ({{Glossary("Cross-site_scripting", "XSS")}}) attacks.

## Solution

All sites must set the `X-Content-Type-Options` header with a value of `nosniff`, and set appropriate MIME types for the files they serve (i.e., via the [`Content-Type`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) header).

`nosniff` blocks a request if the request destination:

- is of type `style` and the MIME type is not `text/css`.
- is of type `script` and the MIME type is not a valid [JavaScript MIME type](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/MIME_types#textjavascript).

## Examples

Prevent browsers from incorrectly detecting non-stylesheets as stylesheets and non-scripts as scripts:

```http
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```
