<p><strong>Certificate Transparency</strong> is an open framework designed to protect against and monitor for certificate misissuances. Newly issued certificates are 'logged' to publicly run CT logs which maintain an append-only, cryptographically assured record of issued TLS certificates.</p>

<p>In this way, certificate authorities (CAs) can be subject to much greater public scrutiny and oversight. Potentially malicious certificates, such as those that violate the CA/B Forum <em>Baseline Requirements</em>, can be detected and revoked much more quickly. Browser vendors are also empowered to make more informed decisions regarding problematic CAs that they may decide to distrust.</p>
