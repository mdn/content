<p><strong>Certificate Transparency</strong> is an open framework designed to protect against and monitor for certificate misissuances. Newly issued certificates are 'logged' to publicly run CT logs which maintain an append-only, cryptographically assured record of issued TLS certificates.</p>

Potentially malicious certificates, such as those that violate the CA/B <span class="st">Forum <em>Baseline Requirements</em></span>, can be detected and revoked much more quickly. Browser vendors are also empowered to make more informed decisions regarding problematic CAs that they may decide to distrust.</p>
