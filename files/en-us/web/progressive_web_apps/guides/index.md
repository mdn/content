This page lists guides to PWA technology. Guides give conceptual explanations of different aspects of PWAs. They're intended to help you understand what kinds of things are possible with PWAs, and to provide enough pointers to help you understand how to achieve them.

- [Making PWAs installable](/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Making_PWAs_installable)
  - : One of the defining aspects of a PWA is that it can be installed on the device, and then appears to users as a platform-specific app, a permanent feature of their device which they can launch directly from the operating system like any other app. In this guide we'll explore what "installable" means, what a PWA needs to provide for it to be installable, and how you can customise the install experience.
- [Offline and background operation](/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Offline_and_background_operation)
  - : In this guide, we'll introduce a set of technologies that enable a PWA to provide a good user experience even when the device has intermittent network connectivity and to perform operations in the background, even when the main app is not running.
- [Structural overview](/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/Structural_overview)
  - : This guide describes some architectural patterns that are commonly used in PWAs.
