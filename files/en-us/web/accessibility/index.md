**Accessibility** (often abbreviated to **A11y** — as in "a" then 11 characters then "y") in Web development means enabling as many people as possible to use Web sites, even when those people's abilities are limited in some way. 

For many people, technology makes things easier. For people with disabilities, technology makes things possible. Accessibility means developing content to be as accessible as possible no matter an individual's physical and cognitive abilities and no matter how they access the web.

"**The Web is fundamentally designed to work for all people**, whatever their hardware, software, language, culture, location, or physical or mental ability. When the Web meets this goal, it is accessible to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive ability." ([W3C - Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/accessibility))

## Key tutorials

The MDN [Accessibility Learning Area](/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility) contains modern, up-to-date tutorials covering accessibility essentials:

  - [What is accessibility?](/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility)
    - : This article starts off the module with a good look at what accessibility actually is — this includes what groups of people we need to consider and why, what tools different people use to interact with the Web, and how we can make accessibility part of our web development workflow.
  - [HTML: A good basis for accessibility](/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML)
    - : A great deal of web content can be made accessible just by making sure the correct HTML elements are used for the correct purpose at all times. This article looks in detail at how HTML can be used to ensure maximum accessibility.
  - [CSS and JavaScript accessibility best practices](/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/CSS_and_JavaScript)
    - : CSS and JavaScript, when used properly, also have the potential to allow for accessible web experiences ... or they can significantly harm accessibility if misused. This article outlines some CSS and JavaScript best practices that should be considered to ensure even complex content is as accessible as possible.
  - [WAI-ARIA basics](/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/WAI-ARIA_basics)
    - : Following on from the previous article, sometimes making complex UI controls that involve unsemantic HTML and dynamic JavaScript-updated content can be difficult. WAI-ARIA is a technology that can help with such problems by adding in further semantics that browsers and assistive technologies can recognize and use to let users know what is going on. Here we'll show how to use it at a basic level to improve accessibility.
  - [Accessible multimedia](/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/Multimedia)
    - : Another category of content that can create accessibility problems is multimedia — video, audio, and image content need to be given proper textual alternatives so they can be understood by assistive technologies and their users. This article shows how.
  - [Mobile accessibility](/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/Mobile)
    - : With web access on mobile devices being so popular, and popular platforms such as iOS and Android having fully-fledged accessibility tools, it is important to consider the accessibility of your web content on these platforms. This article looks at mobile-specific accessibility considerations.
