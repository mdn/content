This article provides practical advice on how to write your web content so that it conforms to the success criteria outlined in the **Operable** principle of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 and 2.1. Operable states that user interface components and navigation must be operable.

> **Note:** To read the W3C definitions for Operable and its guidelines and success criteria, see [Principle 2: Operable — User interface components and navigation must be operable.](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#operable)

## Guideline 2.1 — Keyboard Accessible: Make all functionality available from a keyboard

This guideline covers the necessity of making core website functionality available via a keyboard in addition to other means (e.g. mouse), so that users that rely on keyboard controls can access them.

    <tr>
      <td>2.1.1 Keyboard (A)</td>
      <td>
        All functionality should be accessible using keyboard controls, unless
        it cannot be done using the keyboard (e.g. freehand drawing). Built-in
        controls should be used where possible (e.g. tabbing through form
        controls), and you should only build in custom functionality where
        needed.

          When entering a section of functionality using the keyboard, you
          should be able to get out of that section again using *only* the
          keyboard. For example, if you press <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Return</kbd>
          on a focused button to open an options window, you should be able to
          close that window again and return to the main content using the
          keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is very important so that keyboard users do not get trapped on
          specific sections of your apps.

## Guideline 2.2 — Enough Time: Provide users enough time to read and use content

This guideline covers situations in which functionality may have a time limit. For example, purchases sometimes need to be completed within a time limit for security reasons.

<table class="standard-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>

  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2.2.1 Timing is adjustable (A)</td>
      <td>
        <p>
          For functionality with time limits (e.g. completing a hotel or flight
          booking often has a time limit), the user should be given controls to
          allow them to adjust, extend or turn off the time limit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exceptions to this are activities with time limits longer than 20
          hours, real time events (e.g. live multiplayer games), and any other
          activity that requires a time limit and would be invalidated if it
          were turned off.

        <p>
          For moving/blinking content that starts automatically, lasts longer
          than 5 seconds, and is shown alongside other content, controls should
          be provided to pause, stop, or hide it. This does not apply to
          moving/blinking content that is essential to the experience. Examples
          include scrolling text and videos.
        </p>
        <p>
          For auto-updating information that starts automatically and is shown
          alongside other content, controls should be provided to pause, stop,
          or hide it, or to control the frequency of updates. This does not
          apply to auto-updating content that is essential to the experience.
          Examples include carousels or rotating announcements.

## Guideline 2.4 — Navigable: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are

The conformance criteria under this guideline relate to ways in which users can be expected to orientate themselves, and find the content and functionality they are looking for on the current page or other pages of the site.

    <tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>2.4.1 Bypass blocks (A)</td>
      <td>
        <p>
          A mechanism should be provided that allows the user to skip straight
          to the main content or functionality available on the page, past the
          repeated features (such as the company logo or navigation). This is
          often achieved using "skip links" — links put at the top of the page
          source that link to the main content and are hidden by CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a proper structure of headings and semantic containers is provided
          to navigate with (for example {{htmlelement("section")}},
          {{htmlelement("aside")}}, etc.), then an added "skip link" is
          not needed.

        where the link purpose is ambiguous to <em>all</em> users (see

        the same text are linked to different places. This can cause problems
        for screenreader users, who will often bring up a list of the links out
        of context — several links all labelled "click here", "click here",
        "click here" would be confusing.

    <tr>
      <td>2.4.5 Multiple navigation mechanisms (AA)</td>
      <td>
        <p>
          You should provide at least two general navigation mechanisms to find
          pages on your web site, for example navigation menu, breadcrumb trail,
          site search, site map, list of related links, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only exception to this is where a page is one step in a process,

The conformance criteria under this guideline ensures that users are able to interact with digital technology using different input methods beyond a keyboard or mouse (including touchscreen, voice, device motion, or alternative input devices).
