<p class="summary">This article provides practical advice on how to write your web content so that it conforms to the success criteria outlined in the <strong>Operable</strong> principle of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 and 2.1. Operable states that user interface components and navigation must be operable.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: To read the W3C definitions for Operable and its guidelines and success criteria, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#operable">Principle 2: Operable — User interface components and navigation must be operable.</a></p>

<h2 id="Guideline_2.1_—_Keyboard_Accessible_Make_all_functionality_available_from_a_keyboard">Guideline 2.1 — Keyboard Accessible: Make all functionality available from a keyboard</h2>

<p>This guideline covers the necessity of making core website functionality available via a keyboard in addition to other means (e.g. mouse), so that users that rely on keyboard controls can access them.</p>

This does not apply to moving/blinking content that is essential to the experience. Examples include scrolling text and videos.</p>

    <p>For auto-updating information that starts automatically and is shown alongside other content, controls should be provided to pause, stop, or hide it, or to control the frequency of updates.

<p>The conformance criteria under this guideline relate to ways in which users can be expected to orientate themselves, and find the content and functionality they are looking for on the current page or other pages of the site.</p>

   <td>
    <p>A mechanism should be provided that allows the user to skip straight to the main content or functionality available on the page, past the repeated features (such as the company logo or navigation). This is often achieved using "skip links" — links put at the top of the page source that link to the main content and are hidden by CSS.</p>

    <p>If a proper structure of headings and semantic containers is provided to navigate with (for example {{htmlelement("section")}}, {{htmlelement("aside")}}, etc.), then an added "skip link" is not needed.</p>
   </td>

   <td>The "tabbing order" of focusable page features (e.g. links, buttons, form inputs) makes logical sense, meaning that the page is still usable by non-sighted/keyboard users.</td>
   <td>See <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML#ui_controls">UI controls</a> for general advice on tabbing to controls. If you need to place elements in an unusual layout, it is better to make sure the source order is sensible, then use CSS features like <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Positioning">positioning</a> to handle the layout. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>2.4.4 Link purpose (in context) (A)</td>
   <td>The purpose/destination of a link can be determined from the link text, or from its surroundings (e.g. the surrounding text). Exceptions are where the link purpose is ambiguous to <em>all</em> users (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#ambiguouslinkdef">ambiguous to users in general</a> for a useful explanation of this).</td>
   <td>See <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML#meaningful_text_labels">Meaningful text labels</a>. Also note that you should minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places. This can cause problems for screenreader users, who will often bring up a list of the links out of context — several links all labelled "click here", "click here", "click here" would be confusing.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>2.4.5 Multiple navigation mechanisms (AA)</td>
   <td>
    <p>You should provide at least two general navigation mechanisms to find pages on your web site, for example navigation menu, breadcrumb trail, site search, site map, list of related links, etc.</p>

    <p>The only exception to this is where a page is one step in a process, so should only logically have links to the previous and next steps.</p>
   </td>
   <td>Most of these mechanisms can be created using simple HTML features, for example see <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Basic_native_form_controls#search_field">Search field</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Creating_hyperlinks#active_learning_creating_a_navigation_menu">Creating a navigation menu</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Styling_links#styling_links_as_buttons">Styling links as buttons</a>.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>2.4.6 Headings and labels (AA)</td>
   <td>Heading (e.g. {{htmlelement("h2")}}) and {{htmlelement("label")}} elements clearly describe the purpose of the content and form elements they are supposed to be describing.</td>
   <td>
    <p>See <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML#ui_controls">UI controls</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML#meaningful_text_labels">Meaningful text labels</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/HTML_text_fundamentals#the_basics_headings_and_paragraphs">The basics of headings and paragraphs</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/How_to_structure_a_web_form#the_%3clabel%3e_element">The &lt;label&gt; element</a>.</p>

  <tr>
   <td>2.4.7 Visible focus for focusable elements (AA)</td>
   <td>When tabbing through focusable elements such as links or form inputs, there should be a visual indicator to show you which element currently has focus. This is usually a dotted or blue outline by default (depending on browser, platform, etc.), but this can be overridden by CSS.</td>
   <td>See <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Cross_browser_testing/Accessibility#using_native_keyboard_accessibility">Using native keyboard accessibility</a>.</td>

   <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>2.4.9 Link purpose (link only) (AAA)</td>
   <td>This criterion builds on 2.4.4, stating that to conform to AAA, the purpose/destination of a link should be determinable from the link text alone, even if out of context.</td>
   <td>See <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML#meaningful_text_labels">Meaningful text labels</a>. Also note that you should minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different places.

   <td>2.4.10 Section headings (AAA)</td>
   <td>
    <p>As well as creating a useful document structure, headings should also accurately describe and break up content areas into logical sections.</p>

    <p>Note that this criterion refers to headings and titles in general web content (e.g. headings within text content). Headings and titles for user interfaces are a special case covered in criterion 4.1.2.</p>
