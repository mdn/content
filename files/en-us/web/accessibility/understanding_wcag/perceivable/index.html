<p class="summary">This article provides practical advice on how to write your web content so that it conforms to the success criteria outlined in the <strong>Perceivable</strong> principle of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 and 2.1. Perceivable states that users must be able to perceive it in some way, using one or more of their senses.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: To read the W3C definitions for Perceivable and its guidelines and success criteria, see <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#perceivable">Principle 1: Perceivable - Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.</a></p>

<h2 id="Guideline_1.1_—_Providing_text_alternatives_for_non-text_content">Guideline 1.1 — Providing text alternatives for non-text content</h2>

<p>The key here is that text can be converted to other forms that people with disabilities can use.  For example, it can be spoken by a screenreader, converted to large print, or represented on a braille display. Non-text content refers to multimedia such as images, audio, and video.</p>

  <tr>
   <td>1.3.1 Info and relationships (A)</td>
   <td>
    <p>Any content structure—or visual relationship made between content—can also be determined programmatically, or be inferred from text description. The main situations in which this is relevant are:</p>

    <ul>
     <li>Text labels and the form elements they describe. These are associated unambiguously using the {{htmlelement("label")}} element, which can be picked up by screenreaders, etc.</li>
     <li>Image alt text. Content images should have text available that clearly describes the image's contents, which can be programmatically associated with it (e.g., <code>alt</code> text), or otherwise is easy to associate (e.g., describes it and is sat right next to it). This should mean that the full meaning can still be inferred even if you can't see the image.</li>
     <li>Lists. If the order of list items is important, use an ordered list ({{htmlelement("ol")}}).</li>
    </ul>

    <p><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML">HTML: A good basis for accessibility</a> is packed with information about this, but you should particularly refer to <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML#good_semantics">Good semantics</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML#ui_controls">UI controls</a>, and <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/HTML#text_alternatives">Text alternatives</a>.</p>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1.3.2 Meaningful content sequence (A)</td>
   <td>A sensible, logical reading order should be easy to determine for any content, even if it is visually presented in an unusual way. The order should be made obvious by use of correct semantic elements (e.g., headings, paragraphs), with CSS being used to create any unusual layout styles, irrespective of the markup.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>1.3.3 Sensory characteristics (A)</td>
   <td>
    <p>Instructions for operating controls or understanding content do not rely on a single sense. This may prove inaccessible to people with a disability related to that sense, or a device that does not support that sense. So, for example:</p>

    <ul>
     <li>"Click the round button to continue"<br>
      The button should be clearly labelled so that it is obvious that it is the button you need to press. If there are multiple buttons, make sure they are all clearly labelled to distinguish their function.</li>
     <li>"Listen to the audio instructions for guidance"<br>
      This is obviously problematic—audio will be inaccessible to those with hearing impairments, whereas text can be read, but also spoken by a screenreader if required.</li>
     <li>"Swipe from the right hand side of the screen to reveal the menu"<br>
      Some users might not be able to swipe the screen, either due to disability or because their device does not support touch. An alternative should be provided, such as a keyboard shortcut or button that can be activated by keyboard or other means.</li>
