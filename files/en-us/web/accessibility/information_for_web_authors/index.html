 <li><a class="ex-ref" href="http://users.skynet.be/mgueury/mozilla/index.html">HTML advanced validator (Firefox extension)</a> by Marc Gueury
  <p>This HTML Validator (based on W3C Tidy and on OpenSP for SGML validation) is a powerful, versatile, extended HTML validator. It's free. It <strong>works off-line</strong> and that is a major advantage over other accessibility checkers. No document upload needed and no additional application to launch; everything is accessible within the Firefox browser.</p>

  <p>This HTML advanced validator Firefox extension is very resourceful and highly customizable. It's an extension add-on to Firefox 2.x and Firefox 3.x. It not only checks and reports possible markup errors and warnings (based on W3C Tidy and/or based on true SGML validation) but it can also report accessibility errors and warnings according to selectable accessibility guidelines (Section 508, WCAG Priorities 1, 2 or 3). Its accessibility report is viewable in the View Source window (View &gt; Source code <kbd>Ctrl+U</kbd> or right-click on the status bar). Two panes are added at the bottom of the view source code window: the left pane contains the errors and warnings (with their correspondent line number) and the right pane identifies the checkpoint along with an example and a clickable link to the reference/guideline. <strong>Just wonderful!</strong></p>

  <p>The HTML advanced validator may also be downloaded from <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/249">Firefox Add-ons: HTML Validator</a>.</p>

  <p>How can a web author establish easily and quickly if the background color and foreground (text) color in use in his webpages have sufficient color contrast difference and sufficient color brightness difference? <a class="ex-ref" href="http://juicystudio.com/services/colourcontrast.php#contrast">Color contrast analyzer</a> is an excellent tool for such task. Effective color contrast and effective color brightness difference have a <strong>decisive importance for reading</strong>, furthermore for people with partial color deficiency (see the excellent examples in <a class="ex-ref" href="http://www.lighthouse.org/accessibility/effective-color-contrast/">Effective Color Contrast</a> by Lighthouse International). A study has established that <a class="ex-ref" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb263953.aspx">about 8 percent of all men have some form of color deficiency</a>. Color contrast analyzer algorithm is based on the formula provided in <a class="ex-ref" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/AERT#color-contrast">Techniques For Accessibility Evaluation And Repair Tools</a> from W3C.</p>

  <p>The <a class="ex-ref" href="http://juicystudio.com/services/csstest.php">Juicy Studio CSS analyzer</a> will also analyze and report the color contrast and color brightness differences involved in your stylesheets.</p>

<h3 id="The_Future_Accessible_DHTML">The Future: Accessible DHTML</h3>

<p><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA">DHTML Accessibility Roadmap</a>: a peek into how DHTML will be made accessible in the future. This document gives a plan which is being developed by IBM, Mozilla and <a class="ex-ref" href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/">WAI Protocols and Formats Working Group (PFWG)</a> to address the issue of Accessible DHTML.</p>

<p>Dynamic web content is not accessible, because it uses vanilla &lt;div&gt;'s and &lt;span&gt;'s combined with Javascript rather than declarative markup to describe the behavior of custom widgets such as menus and tree views. These widgets are usually not even keyboard focusable. Furthermore, assistive technologies do not understand what these widgets are supposed to be, or what state they are in or what they are capable of.</p>

<p>This document tackles such difficulties and shows several interactive desktop-style widgets such as tree views, menu bars and spreadsheets which are accessible both with the keyboard and assistive technologies such as screen readers, screen magnifiers and alternative input devices.</p>
