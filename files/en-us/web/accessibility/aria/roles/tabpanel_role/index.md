```html
TBD
```

## Description

### Associated Roles and Attributes


### Keyboard interaction

| Key               | Action |
| ----------------- | ------ |
| <kbd>Tab</kbd>    |        |
| <kbd>→</kbd>      |        |
| <kbd>←</kbd>      |        |
| <kbd>Delete</kbd> |        |

### Required JavaScript features 

> **Note:** Include note about semantic alternatives to using this role or attribute. The first rule of ARIA use is you can use a native feature with the semantics and behavior you require already built in, instead of re-purposing an element and **adding** an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible, then do so. Then post full details in best practices section below.

## Examples

Fill in a simple example that nicely shows a typical usage of the property, then perhaps some more complex examples (see our guide on how to add [code examples](/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Code_examples) for more information).

```html
<div role="tablist">
<div role="tab" aria-selected="true" aria-controls="tabpanel-id"
id="tab-id" tabindex="0">Tab label</div>
```

### Added benefits

Any additional benefits this feature has for non-typical screen reader users, like Google or mobile speech recognition.
