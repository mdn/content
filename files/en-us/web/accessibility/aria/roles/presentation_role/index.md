The `presentation` role and its synonym `none` remove an elements implicit native semantics, such as headings, lists, etc., from the accessibility tree. 

The content is still available to assistive technologies; just the semantics of the container and required associated nested descendants are no longer mapped to the accessibility API.

## Description

While ARIA is primarily used to express semantics, there are some situations where hiding an elementâ€™s semantics from assistive technologies is helpful. This is done with the `presentation` role or its synonym role `none`, which declare that an element is being used only for presentation and therefore does not have any accessibility semantics. 

Writing `<h2 role="presentation">Democracy Dies in Darkness</h2>` removes the heading semantics of the {{HTMLElement('h2')}} element, making it the equivalent of `<div>Democracy Dies in Darkness</div>`. The heading role semantics are removed, but the content itself is still available.

When an element has required descendents, such as the various {{HTMLElement('table')}}, elements and {{HTMLElement('li')}}s children of a {{HTMLElement('ul')}} or {{HTMLElement('ol')}}, the `presentation` or `none`  role on the table or list removes the default semantics of the element on which it was applied and their required descendant elements. 

If `presentation` or `none` is applied to a {{HTMLElement('table')}}  element, the descendant {{HTMLElement('caption')}}, {{HTMLElement('thead')}}, {{HTMLElement('tbody')}}, {{HTMLElement('tfoot')}}, {{HTMLElement('tr')}}, {{HTMLElement('th')}}, and {{HTMLElement('td')}} elements inherit the role and are thus not exposed to assistive technologies. But, elements inside of the {{HTMLElement('th')}} and {{HTMLElement('td')}} elements, including nested tables, are exposed to assistive technologies.

````html
<ul role="presentation">
  <li>
    <a href="#">Link 1</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">Link 2</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#">Link 3</a>
  </li>
</ul>
````

Because the `presentation` role was applied to the {{HTMLElement('ul')}} element, every child {{HTMLElement('li')}} element inherits the `presentation` role. This is because ARIA requires the `listitem` elements to have a parent `list` element. While the {{HTMLElement('li')}}  elements, in this case, are not exposed to assistive technologies, descendants of those required elements are exposed. If we had nested a list within one of those {{HTMLElement('li')}}'s, they would be visible to assistive technologies. For elements with no required children, any elements nested inside the element with `role="presentation"` or `role="none"` preserve their semantics.  In this case, the {{HTMLElement('a')}} elements contained inside of those {{HTMLElement('li')}} elements are exposed. 

The {{HTMLElement('a')}} is a special case. Its role would have been exposed even if it had the `presentation` or `none` role directly applied to it. Browsers ignore `role="presentation"` and `role="none"`on focusable elements, including link and inputs, or anything with a [tabindex](en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/tabindex) attribute set.Browsers also ignore the inclusion of the role if any of the element contains any global ARIA states and properties, such as [`aria-describedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-describedby).

> **Note:** The element with `role="presentation"` is not part of the accessibility tree and should not have an accessible name. Do **not** use [`aria-labelledby`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby) or [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label).

### Associated WAI-ARIA roles, states, and properties

None. If a global ARIA state and property is set, `presentation` or `none` will be ignored, and the implicit role of the element will be used.


## Examples

```html
<img src="spacer.gif" role="none" alt="">
```
