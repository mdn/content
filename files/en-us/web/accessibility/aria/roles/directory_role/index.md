The `directory` role was for a list of references to members of a group, such as a static table of contents. 

> **Warning:** The `directory` role was deprecated in ARIA 1.2

## Description

A directory is a static table of contents, whether linked or unlinked. This includes tables of contents built with lists, including nested lists. Dynamic tables of contents, however, might use a tree role instead.

The deprecated `directory` role was used for lists of references to members of a group, such as a static table of contents.
Use the [`list`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/List_role) role instead. Or, better yet, use the {{HTMLElement('ul')}} or {{HTMLElement('ol')}} elements, as using `directory` does not provide any additional benefits to assistive technology users.
