The `banner` role is for defining a global site header, which usually includes a logo, company name, search icon, and possibly a slogan, generally at the top of the page.

```html
<div role="banner">
  <img src="companylogo.svg" alt="my company name" />
  <h1>Title</h1>
  <p>Subtitle</p>
</div>
```

By default, the HTML5 {{htmlelement("header")}} element has an identical meaning to the `banner` landmark, unless it is a descendant of {{htmlelement("aside")}}, {{htmlelement("article")}}, {{htmlelement("main")}}, {{htmlelement("nav")}}, or {{htmlelement("section")}}, at which point {{htmlelement("header")}} is the heading for that section, and not the equivalent of the site-wide banner.

## Description

A `banner` landmark role converts the container element upon which it is applied into a header. It should be reserved for the site header content that is common across the site generally at the top of every page.

The banner is typically includes things a logo or corporate identity, possibly a site-specific search tool, and is generally what your marketing team would call the header or top banner of the site. If the [`header` element](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header) technique is not being used for that banner, a declaration of `role="banner"` should be used to define a banner landmark to assistive technologies.

Assistive technologies can identify the main `header` element of a page as the `banner` if is a descendant of the [`body` element](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/body), and not nested within an `article`, `aside`, `main`, `nav` or `section` subsection.

Each page may have a `banner` landmark, but each page should be limited to only one `header` with the role of banner. In the case of a page containing nested `document` and/or `application` roles, each nested `document` or `application` role may also have one `banner` landmark. If a page includes more than one `banner` landmark, each should have a unique label.

## Examples

Here's a fake simple banner with a skip to navigation link, a logo, a title and a subtitle. As this is the main header for the site, we've added the `banner` landmark role to the container element.

```html
<div role="banner">
  <a href="#nav" id="skipToMenu" class="skiptocontent">Skip To Keyboard Navigation</a>
  <img src="images/w3c.png" alt="W3C Logo">
  <h1>ARIA Landmarks</h1>
  <p>Identifying page subsections for easy navigation</p>
</div>
```

We could also have written the above with the HTML `header` element:

```html
<header>
  <img src="images/w3c.png" alt="W3C Logo">
  <h1>ARIA Landmarks</h1>
  <p>Identifying page subsections for easy navigation</p>
</header>
```

## Best practices

While it is best to use the `header` element and ensure it is not a descendant of any subsection of the page, sometimes you don't have access to the underlying HTML. If this is the case, you can add the role of `banner` to the main header of the page with JavaScript. Identifying the page's banner in this way will help improve the site's accessibility.
