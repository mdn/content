The `composite` [abstract role](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles#6._abstract_roles) indicates a widget that may contain navigable descendants or owned children.

> **Note:** The `composite` role is an abstract role. It is included here for completeness of documentation. It should not be used by web authors.

## Description

Instead, use the composite subclasses of [`grid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/grid_role), [`select`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/select_role), [`spinbutton`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/spinbutton_role), and [`tablist`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/tablist_role)

## Best Practices

Do not use.
