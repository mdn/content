The `none` role is a synonym for the [`presentation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/presentation_role) role; they both remove an element's implicit ARIA semantics from being exposed to the accessibility tree.

See the [`presentation`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/presentation_role) role for more information.
