{{draft}}

The `mark` role semantically denotes HTML elements containing text that is marked/highlighted for reference purposes. This is semantically equivalent to the HTML {{HTMLElement('mark')}} element. If possible, you should use this element instead.

> **Warning:** The `mark` roll be part of WAI-ARIA 1.3, which is still being drafted.

## Examples

In the following example we have a document section that has been commented. The commented section is marked up using `<span role="mark">`.

```html
<p>The last half of the song is a slow-rising crescendo that peaks at the
<span role="mark" aria-details="thread-1">end of the guitar solo</span>, before fading away sharply.</p>

<div role="comment" id="thread-1" data-author="chris">
  <h3>Chris said</h3>
  <p class="comment-text">I really think this moment could use more cowbell.</p>
  <p><time datetime="2019-03-30T19:29">March 30 2019, 19:29</time></p>
</div>
```

The related comment is marked up using an HTML structure wrapped with a `<div>` containing `role="comment"`.

To associate the comment with the text being commented, we need to wrap the commented text with an element containing the `aria-details` attribute, the value of which should be the ID of the comment.


## Best practices

### Prefer HTML

Using the {{HTMLElement('mark')}} element will automatically communicate a node has a role of `mark`. If at all possible, prefer using it instead.

## Specifications

Will be part of WAI-ARIA 1.3, which is still being drafted.
