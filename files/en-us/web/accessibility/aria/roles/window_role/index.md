## Description

The `window` role, an abstract role, is a superclass for roles defining a browser or app window. The sub-class roles, currently only the [`dialog`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/dialog_role) role, have a window-like <abbr>GUI</abbr>, or graphical user interface, whether it's a full native window or just a section of a document styled to look like a window, where `role="dialog"` would be appropriate.

## Best Practices

Do not use.
