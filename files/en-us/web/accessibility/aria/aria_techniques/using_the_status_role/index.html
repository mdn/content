<h3 id="Description">Description</h3>

<p class="p1">This technique demonstrates how to use the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#status">status</a> role and describes the effect it has on browsers and assistive technology.</p>

<p class="p1">The status role is a type of <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/PF/aria/terms#def_liveregion">live region</a> and a container whose content is advisory information for the user that is not important enough to justify an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#alert">alert</a>, and is often presented as a status bar. When the role is added to an element, the browser will send out an accessible status event to assistive technology products which can then notify the user about it.</p>

<p class="p1">Status information content must be provided within a status object, and it should be ensured that this object does not receive focus. If another part of the page controls what appears in the status, the relationship should be made explicit via the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/states_and_properties#aria-controls">aria-controls</a> attribute.</p>

<p class="p1">Assistive technologies may reserve some cells of a Braille display to render the status.</p>

<h3 id="Possible_effects_on_user_agents_and_assistive_technology">Possible effects on user agents and assistive technology </h3>

<p class="p1">When the status role is added to an element, or such an element becomes visible, the user agent should do the following:</p>

<ul class="ul1">
 <li class="li2">Expose the element as having a status role in the operating system's accessibility API. </li>
 <li class="li2">Fire an accessible status event using the operating system's accessibility API if it supports it.</li>
</ul>

<p class="p1">Assistive technology products should listen for such an event and notify the user accordingly:</p>

<ul class="ul1">
 <li class="li2">Screen readers may provide a special key to announce the current status, and this should present the contents of any status live region. These should be announced when the user is idle, unless <span class="s1">aria-live=”assertive”</span> has been set and in which case the user may be interrupted. </li>
 <li class="li2">Screen magnifiers may enlarge the status.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Opinions may differ on how assistive technology should handle this technique. The information provided above is one of those opinions and therefore not normative.</div>
