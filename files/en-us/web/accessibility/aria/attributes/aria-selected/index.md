The `aria-selected` attribute indicates the current "selected" state of various widgets. 

## Description

The `aria-selected` attribute indicates the current "selected" state for [`gridcell`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Gridcell_role), [`option`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Option_role), [`row`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Row_role) and [`tab`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/Tab_role) roles. 

This attribute is used to indicate which elements within single-selection and multiple-selection composite widgets are selected. If more than one element is selectable at a time, include `aria-multiselectable="true"` on the grid, listbox, tablist, or other owning role, while including `aria-selected` only on the selectable cells, options, and tabs.

For other roles, the currently selected state is set with [`aria-current`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-current), or possibly [`aria-checked`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-checked) or [`aria-pressed`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-pressed), depending on the role.

Widgets that support both `aria-selected` and `aria-current` at the same time have different meanings for each. For example, `aria-current="page"` can be used in a navigation tree to indicate which page is currently displayed, while `aria-selected="true"` indicates which page will be displayed if the user activates the `treeitem`. 

### Grid

Setting `aria-selected="false"` on a focusable gridcell indicates the cell is selectable. If the grid allows more than one gridcell to be selected at a time, set `aria-multiselectable="true"` on the element with role [`grid`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/grid_role). Setting `aria-selected` on a column or row header gridcell does not propagate the state to other cells in the column or row. 

### Option

Both `aria-selected` and `aria-checked` are valid for [`option`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/option_role). Some user interfaces indicate selection with `aria-selected` in single-select list boxes and with `aria-checked` in multi-select list boxes.

Don't specify both `aria-selected` and `aria-checked` on `option` elements contained by the same `listbox` unless the meaning and purpose of `aria-selected` is different from the meaning and purpose of aria-checked in the user interface, the meaning and purpose of each state apparent, and the UI provides separate methods for controlling each state.

### Row

The `aria-selected` attribute is supported on `row` but not `column`. If a grid supports selection, when a cell or row is selected, the selected element has `aria-selected="true"` set. 

If the grid supports column selection and a column is selected, all cells in the column have `aria-selected` set to `true`.

### Tab

In a tablist, `aria-selected` is used on a tab to indicate the currently-displayed [`tabpanel`]((/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/tabpanel_role)).

The selected [`tab`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/tab_role) in a [`tablist`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles/tablist_role) should have has its `aria-selected="true"` set. All inactive tabs in the tablist should have `aria-selected="false"` set.Setting the state only impacts the accessibility tree: make sure to style the active tab in a way that visual indicates it's selected state. The default value for `aria-selected` on a `tab` role is `false`.

If more than one tab is selectable at a time, include `aria-multiselectable` on the `tablist`. 

## Examples

In this `tablist` example, the first `tab` is selected:

```html
<div class="tab-interface">
  <div role="tablist" aria-label="Sample Tabs">
    <span role="tab" aria-selected="true" aria-controls="panel-1" 
      id="tab-1" tabindex="0">
          First Tab
        </span>
    <span role="tab" aria-selected="false" aria-controls="panel-2" 
      id="tab-2" tabindex="-1">
          Second Tab
        </span>
    <span role="tab" aria-selected="false" aria-controls="panel-3" 
      id="tab-3" tabindex="-1">
          Third Tab
        </span>
  </div>
  <div id="panel-1" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0" aria-labelledby="tab-1">
    <p>Content for the first panel</p>
  </div>
  <div id="panel-2" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0" aria-labelledby="tab-2" hidden>
    <p>Content for the second panel</p>
  </div>
  <div id="panel-3" role="tabpanel" tabindex="0" aria-labelledby="tab-3" hidden>
    <p>Content for the third panel</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

> **Note:** ARIA only modifies the accessibility tree for an element and how assistive technology presents the content to users. ARIA doesn't change anything about an element's function or behavior.
