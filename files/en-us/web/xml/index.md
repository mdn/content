The **Extensible Markup Language (XML)** is a markup language designed to store and transport data in a human-readable and machine-readable format.  
Unlike HTML, which defines how data is displayed, XML is used to describe data and its structure.

XML is widely used in web services (e.g. SOAP), configuration files, document formats (e.g. SVG, RSS, Office Open XML), and applications that require structured information exchange.

Its strict syntax enforces well-formed documents, requiring elements to be properly nested and closed.
