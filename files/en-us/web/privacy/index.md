title: Privacy on the web
slug: Web/Privacy
page-type: guide
---

People use websites for several important tasks such as banking, shopping, entertainment, and paying their taxes. In doing so, they are required to share personal information with those sites. Users place a certain level of trust in the sites they share their data with. If that information fell into the wrong hands, it could be used to exploit users, for example by profiling them, targeting them with unwanted ads, or even stealing their identity or money.

Modern browsers already have a wealth of features to protect users' privacy on the web, but that's not enough. To create a trustworthy and privacy-respecting experience, developers need to educate their site users in good practices (and enforce them). Developers should also create sites that collect as little data from users as possible, use the data responsibly, and transport and store it securely.

In this article, we:

- Define privacy and important related terms.
- Examine browser features that automatically protect user privacy.
- Look at what developers can do to create privacy-respecting web content that minimizes the risk of users' personal information/data being obtained unexpectedly by third parties.

## Defining privacy terms and concepts

Before we look at the various privacy and security features available to use on the web, let's define some important terms.

### Privacy and its relationship with security

It is hard to talk about privacy without also talking about security — they are closely related, and you can't really create privacy-respecting websites without good security. Therefore, we shall define both.

- **Privacy** refers to the act of giving users the right to control how their data is collected, stored, and used, and not using it irresponsibly. For example, you should clearly communicate to your users what data you are collecting, who it will be shared with, and how it will be used. Users must be given a chance to consent to your terms of data usage, have access to all of their data that you are storing, and delete it if they no longer wish you to have it. You must also comply with your own terms: nothing erodes user trust like having their data used and shared in ways they never consented to. And this isn't just ethically wrong; it could be against the law. Many parts of the world now have legislation that protects consumer privacy rights (for example the EU's [GDPR](https://gdpr.eu/)).

- **Security** is the act of keeping private data and systems protected against unauthorized access. This includes both company (internal) data, and user and partner (external) data. It is no use having a robust privacy policy that makes your users trust you if your security is weak and malicious parties can steal their data anyway.

### Personal and private information

**Personal information** is any information that describes a user. Examples include:

- Physical attributes such as height, gender expression, weight, hair color, or age
- Postal address, email address, phone number, or other contact information
- Passport number, bank account, credit card, social security number, or other official identifiers
- Health information such as medical history, allergies, or ongoing conditions
- Usernames and passwords
- Hobbies, interests, or other personal preferences
- Biometric data such as fingerprints or facial recognition data

**Private information** is any information that users do not want shared publicly and must be kept private (i.e., information that is accessible only by a certain group of authorized users). Some private data is private by law (for example medical data), and some is private more by personal preference.

### Personally identifiable information

Following on from the above section, **personally identifiable information** (PII) is information that can be used, in whole or in part, to track down and/or identify a specific person. For example, if a site leaks a list of users' names and zip codes online, a bad actor could almost certainly use this information to find their full addresses. Even if a full-scale leak does not happen, it is still possible to identify users through less obvious means, such as the browsers they are using, the devices they are using, specific fonts they have installed, and so on.

### Tracking

**Tracking** refers to the process of a third party recording a user's activity across many different websites. This can be done in various ways, for example:

- Looking at cookies that the user has set (for example, to persist a login or personalization details across different sites) if the third party is embedded on the same domain.
- Looking at the {{httpheader("Referer")}} header to see where a user has navigated from.

Tracking data can be used to profile a user and their interests and preferences, which is usually bad and can be annoying to various degrees. For example:

- **Targeted ads**: Everyone has had the unnerving experience of researching some items to buy on one device and then suddenly being bombarded by adverts for the same products on all their other devices.
- **Selling or sharing data**: Some third parties have been known to compile tracking data and then sell it to/share it with others to use for various purposes, like targeted ads. This is obviously highly unethical and may also be illegal, depending on where in the world it happens.
- **Prejudice via data**: In the worst cases, sharing data could result in the user being unfairly disadvantaged. For example, imagine an insurance company finding out data points about a potential customer that they didn't consent to share, and using them as a justification for increasing insurance premiums.

> **Note:** See [What can third-party resources do?](https://web.dev/learn/privacy/third-parties#what_can_third-party_resources_do) for a useful related scenario description and additional information.

### Fingerprinting

The process of identifying users by building up a store of data points about them is known as **fingerprinting**. This process usually has negative connotations because it can be used to track user activity across different websites in a covert manner. Think about it — tracking is annoying enough even when you consent to it, but having it happen without consent feels really invasive and erodes trust very quickly.

Modern browsers take steps to help prevent fingerprinting-based attacks by either not allowing information to be accessed or, where the information must be made available, by introducing variations that prevent it from being used for identification purposes.

For example, if a website queries a user's browser for the elapsed time, a comparison of that time to the time as reported by the server might be useful as a factor in fingerprinting. Because of this, browsers typically introduce a small amount of variability to timers in order to make them less useful for identifying the user's system. We'll look at other browser privacy-enhancing technologies in the section below.

> **Note:** See also [Fingerprinting](https://web.dev/learn/privacy/fingerprinting/) over on web.dev for additional useful information.

## Privacy features provided by browsers

Browser vendors are aware of the need to protect user privacy and the negative effects of tracking, fingerprinting, etc., on user experience. To this end, they have implemented various features that enhance privacy protection and/or mitigate threats. In this section, we look at different categories of privacy protection that browsers apply automatically.

### HTTPS by default

[Transport Layer Security (TLS)](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Transport_Layer_Security) provides security and privacy by encrypting data during transport over the network and is the technology behind the [HTTPS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTPS) protocol. TLS is good for privacy because it stops third parties from being able to intercept transmitted data and use it maliciously, for example for tracking.

All browsers are moving towards requiring HTTPS by default; this is practically the case already because you can't do much on the web without this protocol.

Related topics are as follows:

- [Certificate Transparency](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Certificate_Transparency)
  - : An open standard for monitoring and auditing certificates, creating a database of public logs that can be used to help identify incorrect or malicious certificates.
- [HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security)
  - : HSTS is used by servers to let them protect themselves from protocol downgrade and cookie hijack attacks by letting sites tell clients that they can only use HTTPS to communicate with the server.
- [HTTP/2](/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_2)
  - : While HTTP/2 technically does not <em>have</em> to use encryption, most browser developers support it only when used with HTTPS; so in that regard, it can be thought of as a feature to enhance security/privacy.

### Opt-in for "powerful features"

So-called "powerful" web API features that provide access to potentially sensitive data and operations are available only in [secure contexts](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts), which basically means HTTPS-only. Not only that, but these web features are gated behind a system of user permissions. Users have to explicitly opt in to features like allowing notifications, accessing geolocation data, making the browser go into fullscreen mode, accessing media streams from webcams, using web payments, etc.

### Anti-tracking technology

Browsers have implemented several anti-tracking features that automatically enhance their users' privacy protection. Many of these block or limit the ability of third-party sites embedded in {{htmlelement("iframe")}}s to access cookies set on the top-level domain, run tracking scripts, etc.

For example, one change that was agreed upon and rolled out across all browsers was an update to the {{httpheader("Set-Cookie")}} header [`SameSite`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value) attribute's default value to `Lax` (see [Changes to the default behavior without SameSite](https://web.dev/articles/samesite-cookies-explained#changes_to_the_default_behavior_without_samesite)).

This attribute controls whether cookies are sent with cross-site requests and can provide some protection against tracking and {{glossary("CSRF")}} attacks. However, the default was `None`, and not many developers adopted it, meaning cross-site cookies were being sent **everywhere**. Changing the default value to `Lax` means that cookies are not sent on cross-site requests, such as on requests to load images or frames, but are sent when a user is navigating to the origin site from an external site, for example, when following a link.

> **Note:** Browsers are aiming to eventually phase out third-party cookies altogether, while providing alternative solutions for common use cases that currently require them.

#### Firefox anti-tracking features

- [Firefox tracking protection](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Firefox_tracking_protection)
  - : Firefox Desktop and Firefox for Android include built-in tracking protection. In Private Browsing windows (tabs in Firefox for Android), Firefox will block content loaded from domains that track users across sites.
- [Enhanced tracking protection](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop)
  - : This feature blocks trackers that follow you around online to collect information about your browsing habits and interests without breaking site functionality. It also includes protections against harmful scripts, such as malware that drains your battery.
- [Redirect tracking protection](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Redirect_tracking_protection)
  - : Firefox includes protection against redirect tracking, an abuse of cross-site navigation. In redirect tracking, a tracker momentarily redirects a user to their website for first-party storage to be able to track that user across websites.
- [State partitioning](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/State_Partitioning)
  - : This concept is a reworking of how Firefox manages client-side state (i.e., data stored in the browser) to mitigate the ability of websites to abuse cross-site tracking. This is achieved by providing what is effectively a "different", isolated storage location to every website a user visits.
- [Storage access policy](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Storage_Access_Policy)
  - : A storage access policy can block cookies and other site data from third-party tracking resources. This policy is designed as an alternative to the older cookie policies available in Firefox for many years. See also our [Storage Access Policy Errors](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Storage_Access_Policy/Errors) reference.
- [Total cookie protection](https://blog.mozilla.org/products/firefox/firefox-rolls-out-total-cookie-protection-by-default-to-all-users-worldwide/)
  - : Firefox gives third-party cookies a separate cookie jar per site, so they can't be tracked across sites

#### Chrome anti-tracking features

Google's [privacy sandbox project](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Privacy_sandbox) is a series of proposals to satisfy cross-site use cases without requiring third-party cookies or other tracking mechanisms. Themes include identity and tracking protection, more privacy-respecting ad solutions, preventing covert tracking, and safely sharing data across browsing contexts.

#### Safari anti-tracking features

- [Intelligent Tracking Prevention](https://webkit.org/blog/9521/intelligent-tracking-prevention-2-3/)
  - : There are multiple privacy enhancements in the Safari browser to prevent tracking.

#### Edge anti-tracking features

- [Tracking prevention](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/web-platform/tracking-prevention)
  - : Edge blocks trackers from unvisited sites; in addition, known harmful trackers are blocked by default.
- Third-party cookie default
  - : Edge does not yet block third-party cookies by default, but this can be set by users in Settings.

## Privacy considerations for client-side developers

There are several actions web developers can and should take to improve privacy for their users. The below sections discuss the most important ones. Some of the categories are not purely technical tasks as such and will involve collaboration with other team members.

## Collect data ethically

Companies collect lots of different data from their users for a variety of different reasons:

- Usernames, passwords, emails, etc. for authentication purposes.
- Emails, postal addresses, and phone numbers for communication.
- Age, gender, geographical location, favorite pastimes, and a host of other PII for anything from site personalization to customer satisfaction surveys.
- Browsing habits on their sites and other sites, to measure page and feature success metrics.
  And so much more.

When collecting data from your customers, you have an opportunity to behave with integrity, show them that you are trustworthy, and build a great relationship with them, in turn, improving your brand and your chance of success.

The ethics of data collection can be broken down into three simple principles:

- Don't collect more data than you need
- Communicate clearly how you are going to use the data you collect
- Delete the data once you have finished with it

> **Note:** The tips provided below make for a better, more privacy-aware user experience, but many of them are required by law to comply with regulations, for example the [GDPR](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&from=EN) in the EU. You should make sure to find out what regulations apply to you in your locale, and what you need to do to comply with them.

### Don't collect more data than you need

It is tempting to ask for a lot of data from your users because you think it might be useful in the future. However, every bit of extra data you collect adds risk to your users' privacy and increases the chance that they will abandon the step they are performing (whether it is filling out a survey or signing up for a service).

It is good to anonymize data. You should also consider whether you can get what you need by making your data request less granular. As an example, instead of asking a user their favorite products, you could ask them to select between more general categories.

The best way to protect user privacy though is to minimize the data you collect. Referring to the previous example, you could infer the same data by looking at user purchase history. As another example, users really appreciate being able to buy products anonymously. You shouldn't force them to sign up for an account; if it's not necessary for the service to operate, it should be their choice.

### Communicate clearly how you are going to use the data you collect

Once you have decided what data you are going to collect, you should publish a privacy policy on your site that clearly states:

- Data that you collect
- Ways in which you use the data
- Parties with whom you tend to share the data, if at all, and a declaration that you will ask for user consent before sharing
- Duration for which you keep the data for before it is deleted
- Ways in which users can view the data you have collected from them and a way for them to delete it if they want to

When providing you with data, your users should be given an opportunity to read your privacy policy, and consent to it. They should be able to control if they are happy with this and agree to your terms. And as indicated above, they should also get to see what data of theirs you have collected, and delete it if they want to.

When you've published your privacy policy, you need to make sure that you comply with it — doing what you say you are going to do is very important in building user trust. You should only collect the data you say you'll collect, and only use it for the purpose you say you'll use it for. If someone from your company comes up with a clever new way to use existing data, that still isn't OK under the terms of your policy if it doesn't specify that you'll use it for that purpose. If users consented to the use of their data for a specific purpose and that purpose expands, you may have to consider obtaining new consent.

### Delete the data once you have finished with it

Earlier on, we mentioned giving users a way to see what data of theirs you have collected, and delete it if they want to. You could possibly do this as part of the same experience they can use to delete their account (their data goes with it), or make them two separate options. Either way, the options should be easy to find.

Allowing the user to choose when significant portions of data get deleted is very empowering, and builds trust, but there may be some bits of data that you will want to handle deletion of yourself. For example, some data might only be used for a few hours or minutes and then deleted, like data that is used during the administration of a user's session while they are logged in.

> **Note:** The {{httpheader("Clear-Site-Data")}} HTTP response header is very useful for clearing short-lived user data — it instructs the browser to clear out its cache and/or cookies and/or storage (e.g. [Web Storage](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) or [IndexedDB](/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API) data). For example, you might get your server to send it along with a "logged out confirmation" page so that once the user is logged out, their data is safely removed.

## Cut down on tracking cookies

Earlier on we discussed tracking, and some of the unethical purposes they are used for. We shouldn't have to spell out how such uses can erode user trust; wherever possible, you should only use cookies for ethical uses, such as transferring login or other personalization status across sites.

Also recall from earlier that browsers are implementing a number of technologies to limit the usage of tracking cookies, especially cross-site cookies, with the eventual aim of removing them altogether. It is a good idea to prepare for this, by limiting the amount of tracking activities you rely on, and/or implementing desired information persistence in other ways. For example:

- Use an alternative client-side storage mechanism such as [Web Storage](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API) to persist data. This does have the downside that the data is stored per-origin, so it can't be shared.
- Use a technology such as the [Storage Access API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API) to allow your sites to opt-in to using cross-site cookies in a safe and controlled way.
- Use a server-side solution for data persistence.

> **Note:** To reiterate what we said earlier, make sure you clearly communicate to your users what you are doing via your privacy policy, allow them to opt-in, and easily delete their data if they change their mind at a later date.

### Carefully manage third-party resources

Of course, it would be so easy to manage privacy if you were only worried about resources you have created (code, cookies, sites, etc.). The real challenge comes from the fact that your site will likely use third-party resources — this can include libraries, frameworks, APIs, externally-hosted resources such as images or videos, and a host of other resources.

Third-party resources are an essential part of modern web development, and bring with them a lot of power. However, any third party resource you allow onto your site potentially has the same power as your own resources. A malicious embedded script could secretly steal your users' data, for example sending it off to a third-party server. And a third-party service could use the {{httpheader("Referer")}} header sent with every request to build up a profile of user activity that could be used for tracking.

It is important to audit all of the third party resources you use on your site. Make sure you know what data they are collecting, what requests they are making and to whom, what their privacy policies are. Your carefully designed privacy policy is no use if you are using a third-party script that violates it.

> **Note:** There are various tools out there that can help you build up a picture of what requests a site is making, for example the [Request Map Generator](https://requestmap.webperf.tools/).

Once you have audited your third-party resources and understand what they are doing, you should then consider their negatives as a trade-off for the value they bring. If a third-party script is free and really useful but collects quite a lot of user data, you could:

1. Accept that trade-off, update your privacy policy to include details of it, and hope that it doesn't impact your users' trust too much.
2. Look for an alternative, less data-hungry third party tool.
3. Build your own tool.

The following list provides some tips on how to mitigate privacy risks inherent with using third party resources:

- When embedding third party resources, consider if there is a way to achieve the same or a similar effect with less privacy impact. For example, it might be fun to have a social media post viewer embedded on your site, but is it really necessary? Wouldn't a link to your social media page be sufficient? Also, some third-party services have privacy-enhancing options. See for example YouTube's [Embed videos & playlists > Turn on privacy-enhanced mode](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/171780).
- Where possible, you should block third parties from receiving a {{httpheader("Referer")}} header when you make requests to them. This can be done in a pretty granular way, for example by including [rel="noreferrer"](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/rel/noreferrer) on external links:

  ```html
  <a href="/some/external/resource" rel="noreferrer"></a>
  ```

  Or you could set this more globally for the page or site, for example by using the {{httpheader("Referrer-Policy")}} header.

  > **Note:** See also [Referer header: privacy and security concerns](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Referer_header:_privacy_and_security_concerns).

- Use the {{httpheader("Permissions-Policy")}} HTTP header to control access to "powerful features" (such as notifications, geolocation data, accessing media streams from webcams, etc.). This can be useful for privacy because it stops third party sites from doing unexpected things with these features, and users don't want to be unnecessarily bombarded by permissions prompts that they may not understand.

  The following example disables [Picture-in-Picture](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Picture-in-Picture_API) everywhere, allows [Geolocation](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation_API) to be used only on one specific origin, and allows camera usage everywhere:

  ```http
  Permissions-Policy: picture-in-picture=(), geolocation=(self https://example.com), camera=*;
  ```

  To enable usage of "powerful features" inside third party sites embedded inside {{htmlelement("iframe")}} elements, you specify permissions policies inside an `allow` attributes. The `<iframe>` equivalent of the above is as follows:

  ```html
  <iframe
    src="https://example.com"
    allow="picture-in-picture 'none'; geolocation 'self' https://example.com; camera '*'">
  </iframe>
  ```

  > **Note:** See also our [Permissions-Policy guide](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy) for more information, and [permissionspolicy.com](https://www.permissionspolicy.com/) for useful tools including a policy generator.

  > **Note:** The {{htmlelement("iframe")}} `sandbox` attribute also allows you to allow or disallow usage of certain features.

> **Note:** See [Third parties](https://web.dev/learn/privacy/third-parties/) over on web.dev for additional useful information on auditing and more.

## Protect user data

You need to make sure that, once you have collected data from your users, that it is transmitted and stored securely. This is more of a [security](/en-US/docs/Web/Security) topic, but it is worth mentioning here — a good privacy policy is no good if your security is lax and attackers can steal the data from you.

The below tips offer some guidance on protecting your user's data:

- Security is hard to get right. When implementing a secure solution that involves data collection — particularly if it is sensitive data such as log-in credentials — it makes sense to use a reputable solution from a well-respected provider. For example, any respectable server-side framework will have built-in features to protect against common vulnerabilities. You could also consider using a specialized product for your purpose — for example an identity provider solution, or a secure online survey provider.
- If you want to roll out your own solution for collecting user data, make sure you understand what you are doing. Hire an experienced server-side developer and/or security engineer to implement the system, and ensure it is tested thoroughly. Use multifactor authentication (MFA) to provide better protection. Consider using a dedicated API such as [Web Authentication](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API) or [Federated Credential Management](/en-US/docs/Web/API/FedCM_API) to streamline the client-side of the app.
- When collecting user sign-up information, enforce strong passwords so that your user's account details cannot be easily guessed. Weak passwords are one of the main causes of security breaches. In addition, encourage your users to use a password manager so that they can use more complex passwords, without needing to worry remembering them, thereby avoiding a security risk by writing them down.
- Don't include sensitive data in URLs — if a third party intercepts the URL (for example via the {{httpheader("Referer")}} header), they could steal that information. Use `POST` requests rather than `GET` requests to avoid this.
- Consider using tools like [Content Security Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) and [Permissions Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Permissions_Policy) to enforce a set of feature usage on your site that makes it harder to introduce vulnerabilities. Be careful when doing this — if you block usage of a feature that a third party script relies on to work, you may end up breaking your site's functionality. This is something you can look into when auditing your third party resources (see [Carefully manage third-party resources](#carefully_manage_third-party_resources)).
