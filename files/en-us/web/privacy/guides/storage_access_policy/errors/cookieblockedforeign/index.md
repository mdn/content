A request to access cookies or storage was blocked because it came from a third-party (a different origin) and content blocking is enabled.

## Message

Firefox:

```plain
CookieBlockedForeign=Request to access cookies or storage on "X" was blocked because we are blocking all third-party storage access requests and content blocking is enabled.
```

## What can be done

The permission can be changed or removed by going to _Settings > Privacy & Security > Enhanced Tracking Protection_ and adding an exception with the _Manage Exceptions_â€¦ button.

If the resource that is being blocked doesn't need authentication, you can fix the warning message by adding a `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute to the relevant element.
