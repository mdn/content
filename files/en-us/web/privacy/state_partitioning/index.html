<p class="summary">
  State Partitioning is a broad effort to rework how Firefox manages client-side
  state (i.e., data stored in the browser) to mitigate the ability of websites
  to abuse state for cross-site tracking. This effort aims to
  achieve that by providing what is effectively a "different", isolated storage
  location to every website a user visits. This article gives an overview of
  the mechanism, lists the affected APIs and explains how to debug affected
  sites.
  <br>
  <br>
  State Partitioning is currently turned on by default in the Firefox Nightly
  channel. A subset of the state partitioning efforts (namely <a href="#network_partitioning">
  network partitioning</a>) has been enabled by default in the release channel
  of Firefox since version 85.
</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<h3>Cross-site tracking using shared state</h3>
<p>
  Browsers traditionally key client-side state by the origin (or sometimes
  registrable domain) of the location a resource was loaded from. For example,
  the cookies, localStorage objects, and caches available to an iframe loaded
  from <code>https://example.com/hello.html</code> will be keyed by
  <code>example.com</code>. This is true regardless of whether the browser
  is currently loading resources from that domain as a <i>first-party</i>
  resources or as an embedded <i>third party</i> resources. Trackers have taken
  advantage of this cross-site state to store user identifiers and access them
  across websites. The example below shows how <code>example.com</code> can use
  its cross-site state (in this instance, cookies) to track a user across its
  own site as well as <code>A.example</code> and <code>B.example</code>.
</p>

<h3>Past approaches to blocking cross-site tracking</h3>
<p>
  Firefox's past cookie policies attempt to mitigate tracking by blocking
  access to some storage APIs (e.g., cookies and localStorage) for certain
  domains under certain conditions. For example, our "block all third-party
  cookies" policy will prevent all domains from accessing certain storage APIs
  when loaded in a third-party context. Our current
  <a href="en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Privacy/Storage_access_policy">
    default cookie policy
  </a> blocks access in a third-party context only for domains classified as
  trackers.
</p>

<h2 id="state_partitioning">State Partitioning</h2>
<p>
  State Partitioning is a different approach to preventing cross-site tracking.
  Rather than block access to certain stateful APIs in a third-party context,
  Firefox provides embedded resources with a separate storage
  bucket for every top-level website. More specifically, Firefox double-keys
  all client-side state by the
  <i><a class="external"
  href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#origin">origin</a></i>
  of the resource being loaded and by the <i>top-level
  <a class="external"
  href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/origin.html#site">site</a></i>.
  In most instances, the top-level site is the scheme and eTLD+1 of the top-level
  page being visited by the user.
</p>
<p>
  In the example below <code>example.com</code> is embedded in
  <code>A.example</code> and <code>B.example</code>. However, since storage is
  partitioned, there are three distinct storage buckets (instead of one). The
  tracker can still access storage, but since every storage bucket is
  additionally keyed under the top-level site, the data it has access to on A
  will be different than the data on B. This will prevent a tracker from storing
  an identifier in their cookies when visited directly and then retrieving that
  identifier when embedded in other websites.

<h3>Standardization</h3>
<p>
  The <a class="external" href="https://privacycg.github.io/">Privacy Community
  Group</a> has a Work Item for
  <a class="external" href="https://privacycg.github.io/storage-partitioning/">
  Client-Side Storage Partitioning</a>. This serves as an overview of the
  standardization efforts for storage partitioning in the individual standards
  affected. We intend to align our state partitioning implementation with these
  efforts as the Work Item is standardized.

<h3 id="network_partitioning">Network Partitioning</h3>
  <p>Networking-related APIs are not intended to be used for websites to store
  data, but they can be
  <a class="external" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2021/01/26/supercookie-protections/">abused</a>
  for cross-site tracking. As such, the following network APIs and caches are
  <strong>permanently</strong> partitioned by the top-level site.</p>

    <p><strong>Note</strong>: Network Partitioning is permanent. Websites can't
    control or relax these restrictions.</p>

<h3 id="dynamic_state_partitioning">Dynamic Partitioning</h3>
  <p>To prevent cross-site tracking via JavaScript accessible storage APIs,
  Firefox partitions them for third-parties by top-level site. As opposed to
  Network Partitioning this boundary is dynamic and storage access to the
  embedders context maybe be granted in certain circumstances.</p>
  <p>Firefox implements the
  <a href="#storage_access_api">StorageAccessAPI</a> to allow frames to request
  access to the parent storage. Access to top-level storage may also be granted
  automatically in specific scenarios. <a href="#partitioning_heuristics">You
  can read more about these heuristics here.</a></p>

  <h4 id="partitioning_heuristics">Storage Access Heuristics</h4>
  <p>
    To improve web compatibility, Firefox currently includes some heuristics to
    grant unpartitioned storage access automatically to third parties that
    receive user interaction. These heuristics are intended to allow some
    third-party integrations that are common on the web to continue to function.
  </p>
  <div class="warning">
    <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Storage access heuristics are a transitional
    feature meant to prevent website breakage. They should not be relied upon
    for current and future web development.</p>
  </div>

  <h5 id="storage_access_window_open_heuristics">Opener Heuristics</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      When a partitioned third-party opens a pop-up window that has
      <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/opener">opener access</a> to the
      originating document, the third-party is granted storage access to its
      embedder for 30 days.
    </li>
    <li>
      When a first-party <code>a.example</code> opens a third-party pop-up
      <code>b.example</code>, <code>b.example</code> is granted
      third-party storage access to <code>a.example</code> for 30 days.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div class="note">
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: For third-parties which abuse these heuristic for
    tracking purposes, we may require user interaction with the popup before
    storage access is granted.</p>
  </div>

  <h5 id="storage_access_redirect_heuristics">Redirect Heuristics</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If a site <code>b.example</code> redirects to <code>a.example</code>, then
      <code>b.example</code> receives storage access to its embedder
      <code>a.example</code> if both <code>a.example</code> and
      <code>b.example</code> have been visited and interacted with within the
      last 10 minutes. This storage access will be granted for 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
      If a tracker <code>tracker.example</code> (as classified by the Enhanced
      Tracking Protection) redirects to a non-tracker
      <code>a.example</code> and <code>tracker.example</code> received user
      interaction as a first-party within the last 45 days,
      <code>tracker.example</code> is granted storage access to
      <code>a.example</code> for 15 minutes.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="storage_access_api">Storage Access API</h4>
  <p>
    Third-party frames may use
    <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/requestStorageAccess">
      <code>document.requestStorageAccess</code>
    </a>
    to request unpartitioned storage access through the
    <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage_Access_API">StorageAccessAPI</a>. Once
    granted, the requesting third-party will gain access to its first-party
    storage bucket (i.e., the storage it would have access to if visited as a
    first-party). Any calls to <a
    href="#dynamically_partitioned_apis">dynamically partitioned APIs</a>, for
    example
    <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage">localStorage</a>, will be
    made in context of the first-party bucket.
  </p>
  <div class="warning">
    <p><strong>Warning</strong>: When storage access is granted there may still
    be references to the partitioned storage. However, sites shouldn't rely on
    being able to use partitioned and unpartitioned storage at the same
    time.</p>
  </div>

<h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>
<p>
  We encourage site owners to test their sites, particularly those that rely on
  third-party content integrations. There are several features in Firefox to
  make testing easier.
</p>


<h4>Logging</h4>
<p>
  Here is an overview of the messages logged to the web console when interacting
  with storage in a third-party context. In the following examples,
<code>a.example</code> is the top-level site which embeds the third-party frame
<code>b.example</code>.
</p>

<table class="standard-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
     <th scope="col">Reason</th>
     <th scope="col">Console Message</th>
    </tr>
   </thead>
  <tbody>
   <tr>
    <th scope="row">Storage of a third-party frame is partitioned</th>
    <td>Partitioned cookie or storage access was provided to “b.example” because
    it is loaded in the third-party context and storage partitioning is
    enabled.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th scope="row">Storage access is granted through a <b>heuristic</b></th>
    <td>Storage access automatically granted for First-Party isolation
    “b.example” on “a.example”.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th scope="row">Storage access is granted via the
      <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/requestStorageAccess">StorageAccessAPI</a>
    </th>
    <td>Storage access granted for origin “b.example” on “a.example”.</td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>

<h4>Clear Third-Party Storage-Access</h4>
<p>
  If a third-party iframe is granted storage access to the parent context,
  Firefox sets a permission. To revoke access you can clear the permission via
  the <a class="external"
  href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/site-information-panel">Site
  Information Panel</a> in the permissions section under "Cross-site Cookies".
</p>

<h4>Test Preferences</h4>
<div class="warning">
  <p><strong>Warning</strong>: Make sure to set these prefs in a separate
  Firefox profile or reset them after testing.</p>
</div>

<h5>Disable Heuristics</h5>
<p>
  The following prefs can be used to disable individual storage access
  heuristics via the
  <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-config-editor-firefox">
    config editor</a>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Enable / disable the <a href="#storage_access_redirect_heuristics">redirect
    heuristics</a>:
    <code>privacy.restrict3rdpartystorage.heuristic.recently_visited,
    privacy.restrict3rdpartystorage.heuristic.redirect</code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Enable / disable the <a href="#storage_access_window_open_heuristics">window
    open heuristics</a>:
    <code>privacy.restrict3rdpartystorage.heuristic.window_open,
    privacy.restrict3rdpartystorage.heuristic.opened_window_after_interaction</code>
  </li>
</ul>

<h5>Disable Network Partitioning</h5>
<p>Network partitioning can be disabled with the
<code>privacy.partition.network_state</code> pref.</p>

<h5 id="disable_dynamic_state_partitioning">Disable Dynamic State Partitioning</h5>
<p>To disable dynamic storage partitioning for all sites you can use the
<code>network.cookie.cookieBehavior</code> pref:</p>
<table class="standard-table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
     <th scope="col">Value</th>
     <th scope="col">Description</th>
    </tr>
   </thead>
  <tbody>
   <tr>
    <th scope="row">5</th>
    <td>Reject (known) trackers and partition third-party storage.</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th scope="row">4</th>
    <td>Only reject trackers (Storage partitioning disabled).</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
    <th scope="row">0</th>
    <td>Allow all</td>
   </tr>
  </tbody>
 </table>

<h5>Exempt specific origins from partitioning</h5>

 <p>Dynamic State Partitioning can also be disabled for specific
 origins with the <code>privacy.restrict3rdpartystorage.skip_list</code>
 preference. This pref holds a comma separated list of origins to exempt.
 The pref value should follow the following format
 <code>first-party_origin_1,third-party_origin_1;first-party_origin_2,third-party_origin_2;...</code>.
 </p>
 <p>
  For example, to disable partitioning for <code>tracker.example</code>
  on <code>example.com</code> and for <code>social.example</code> on
  <code>news.example</code>, you would set the pref to the following:
</p>
<pre>
 <code>https://tracker.example,http://example.com;https://social.example,https://news.example</code>
</pre>
