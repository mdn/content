## Message

Firefox:

    CookiePartitionedForeign=Partitioned cookie
    or storage access was provided to “<URL>” because it is loaded in the
    third-party context and storage partitioning is enabled.

## What went wrong?

A request to access cookies or storage was _partitioned_ because it
came from a third-party (a different origin) and
[dynamic state partitioning
](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/State_Partitioning#dynamic_state_partitioning)is enabled.

With Dynamic State Partitioning enabled, Firefox provides embedded resources with a
separate storage bucket for every top-level website. Embedded third-parties may
request access to the top-level storage bucket via the [Storage Access API](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/State_Partitioning#storage_access_api).
You can also [disable
Dynamic State Partitioning](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/State_Partitioning#disable_dynamic_state_partitioning) with the
`network.cookie.cookieBehavior` pref.
