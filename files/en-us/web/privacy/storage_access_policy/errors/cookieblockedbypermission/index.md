## Message

Firefox:

```
CookieBlockedByPermission=Request to access cookies or storage on "X" was blocked because of custom cookie permission.
```

## What went wrong?

A request to access cookies or storage was blocked because there's a custom user-defined permission set.

The permission can be changed or removed by:

- Going to _Preferences > Content Blocking > Cookies and Site Data_
- Clicking on the _Manage Permissions_ button and updating the listed exceptions
