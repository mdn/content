## Message

Firefox:

    CookieBlockedAll=Request to access cookies or storage on “X” was blocked because we are blocking all storage access requests.

## What went wrong?

A request to access cookies or storage was blocked because the browser is blocking all storage access.

The permission can be changed or removed by:

- Going to _Preferences > Content Blocking_
- In the _Custom_ Content Blocking section, selecting a value other than _All Cookies_ for the _Cookies_ item

If the resource that is being blocked doesn't need authentication, you can fix the warning message by adding a `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute to your element.
