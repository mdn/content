<h2 id="Message">Message</h2>

<p>Firefox:</p>

<pre class="syntaxbox">CookieBlockedAll=Request to access cookies or storage on “X” was blocked because we are blocking all storage access requests.</pre>

<h2 id="What_went_wrong">What went wrong?</h2>

<p>A request to access cookies or storage was blocked because the browser is blocking all storage access.</p>

<p>The permission can be changed or removed by:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Going to <em>Preferences &gt; Content Blocking</em></li>
 <li>In the <em>Custom</em> Content Blocking section, selecting a value other than <em>All Cookies </em>for the <em>Cookies</em> item</li>
</ul>

<p>If the resource that is being blocked doesn't need authentication, you can fix the warning message by adding a <code>crossorigin="anonymous"</code> attribute to your element.</p>
