<p>Firefox:</p>

<pre class="syntaxbox">CookieBlockedForeign=Request to access cookies or storage on “X” was blocked because we are blocking all third-party storage access requests and content blocking is enabled.</pre>

<h2 id="What_went_wrong">What went wrong?</h2>

<p>A request to access cookies or storage was blocked because it came from a third-party (a different origin) and content blocking is enabled.</p>

<p>The permission can be changed or removed by:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Going to <em>Preferences &gt; Content Blocking </em>and either</li>
 <li>adding an exception with the <em>Manage Exceptions</em>… button</li>
 <li>choosing the <em>Custom</em> Content Blocking and unchecking the <em>Cookies</em> checkbox</li>
</ul>

<p>If the resource that is being blocked doesn't need authentication, you can fix the warning message by adding a <code>crossorigin="anonymous"</code> attribute to the relevant element.</p>
