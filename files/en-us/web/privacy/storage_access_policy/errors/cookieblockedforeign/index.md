## Message

Firefox:

    CookieBlockedForeign=Request to access cookies or storage on “X” was blocked because we are blocking all third-party storage access requests and content blocking is enabled.

## What went wrong?

A request to access cookies or storage was blocked because it came from a third-party (a different origin) and content blocking is enabled.

The permission can be changed or removed by:

- Going to _Preferences > Content Blocking_ and either
- adding an exception with the _Manage Exceptions_… button
- choosing the _Custom_ Content Blocking and unchecking the _Cookies_ checkbox

If the resource that is being blocked doesn't need authentication, you can fix the warning message by adding a `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute to the relevant element.
