Google's **privacy sandbox** project is a series of proposals to satisfy cross-site use cases without requiring third-party cookies or other tracking mechanisms, preparing for a future web in which third-party cookies have been removed. Themes include identity and tracking protection, more privacy-respecting ad solutions, preventing covert tracking, and safely sharing data across browsing contexts.

## Privacy sandbox features

- [Cookies Having Independent Partitioned State (CHIPS)](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Privacy_sandbox/Partitioned_cookies)
  - : Also known as **partitioned cookies**, CHIPs allows developers to opt a cookie into partitioned storage, with a separate cookie jar per top-level site.
- [Related Website Sets](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/privacy-sandbox/related-website-sets/)
  - : A mechanism for a company to declare relationships between different origins. Supporting browsers will then allow limited third-party cookie access across those origins for specific purposes.
- [Topics API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Topics_API)
  - : Provides a mechanism for developers to implement use cases such as **interest-based advertising (IBA)** based on topics collected by the browser as the user navigates different pages, rather than collected by the developer by tracking the user's journey around different sites with third-party cookies.

## Other topics

- [Privacy sandbox enrollment](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Privacy_sandbox/Enrollment)
  - : To access certain privacy sandbox features, developers must complete an **enrollment** process.
