The **`loop`** statement creates a label that can later be branched to with a `br`. The loop instruction doesn't loop by itself; you need to branch to it to actually create a loop.

The **`loop`** statement is the opposite of the `block` statement, in the sense that while branching to a `loop` jumps to the beginning of the loop, branching to a `block` jumps to the end of the block, that is, out of the block.

{{InteractiveExample("Wat Demo: loop", "tabbed-taller")}}

```wat interactive-example
(module
  ;; import the browser console object, you'll need to pass this in from JavaScript
  (import "console" "log" (func $log (param i32)))

  (func
    ;; create a local variable and initialize it to 0
    (local $i i32)

    (loop $my_loop

      ;; add one to $i
      local.get $i
      i32.const 1
      i32.add
      local.set $i

      ;; log the current value of $i
      local.get $i
      call $log

      ;; if $i is less than 10 branch to loop
      local.get $i
      i32.const 10
      i32.lt_s
      br_if $my_loop

    )
  )

  (start 1) ;; run the first function automatically
)
```

```js interactive-example
const url = "{%wasm-url%}";
await WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch(url), { console });
```

## Syntax

```wasm
;; label the loop so that it can be branched to
(loop $my_loop

  ;; branch to the loop.
  ;; most of the time you'll want to put this in an if statement and only branch on condition,
  ;; otherwise you have an infinite loop.
  br $my_loop

)
```
