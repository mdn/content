The **`eq`** instructions, short for *equal*, check if two numbers are equal. If both numbers are equal `1` will be pushed on to the stack, otherwise `0` will be pushed on to the stack.

Similarly, the **`eqz`** instructions check if a number is equal to zero, the **`eqz`** instructions are only available for the integer types and not for the floating point types.

## Syntax

```wasm
;; load 2 numbers on to the stack
local.get $num
i32.const 2

;; check if $num is equal to '2'
i32.eq

;; if $num is equal to `2`, `1` will be pushed on to the stack,
;; otherwise `0` will be pushed on to the stack.
```
