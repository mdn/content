## August 2025

In the summer of 2025, we completed work on significant changes to the structure and positioning of our "Test your skills" articles and other reader exercises:

- The "Test your skills" article content has been updated so that the language and approach in each one is consistent. For example, all of the old interactive editors have been replaced with live sample exercises that make use of the [MDN Playground](/en-US/play), and most of the repetitive boilerplate has been consolidated into a single [Test your skills help section](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development#test_your_skills).
- The position of the "Test your skills" articles in the navigation has been updated. Instead of being available from "Test your skills" submenus and linked to from the end of associated tutorials, the articles now appear in the sidebar and in the previous/next links. They are now mandatory articles in the flow, rather than optional resources.
- The reader exercises in the tutorials have also been modernized, to replace old code editors and make language consistent.

## December 2024

A major update to the Learn web development section was started in November 2024 and finally published in December 2024. To summarize, the MDN Curriculum has been merged into Learn web development.

Specifically:

- The content is the same, but it has been rearranged to follow the same learning pathway structure as the Curriculum. In a few cases, content was deemed not suitable for a beginner audience and has been migrated to other parts of MDN.
- Specific learning outcomes have been added to the top of most of the articles, to match the learning outcomes detailed in the Curriculum.
- Other features from the Curriculum have been migrated across to the Learn Web Development section, such as the [About](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/About) page and [Resources for educators](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Educators).

The [original curriculum pages](/en-US/curriculum/) are being kept as a summary of the Learn web development content that is useful for educators when planning curricula.

Moving forward, we will continue to update the content and design to make Learn web development even more useful to learners and educators.
