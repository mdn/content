## The essential skill set for new front-end developers

Welcome to MDN **Learning Web Development** (also known as **Learn**). This resource provides a structured set of tutorials teaching the essential skills and practices for being a successful front-end developer, along with challenges and further recommended resources.

## About Learn web development

- Teaches the essential skills and knowledge every front-end developer needs for career success and industry relevance, as defined in the [MDN Curriculum](/en-US/curriculum/).

- Created by the MDN community and refined with insights from students, educators, and developers from the broader web community.

- Designed to take you from "beginner" to "comfortable" (not "beginner" to "expert"), giving you enough knowledge to use more advanced resources (such as [the rest of MDN](/en-US/)).

> [!NOTE]
> Last updated: December 2024 ([see changelog](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Changelog)).

You should start here if you are a complete beginner (i.e., you've not installed a code editor or written any code yet).
- Want to master the essentials?
  - : Our [Core modules](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core) provide a structured set of tutorials teaching the essential skills and practices for being a successful front-end developer.
- Beyond the basics?
