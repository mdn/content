## The essential skillset for new front-end developers

Welcome to MDN **Learning Web Development** (also known as **Learn**). This resource provides a structured set of tutorials teaching the essential skills and practices for being a successful front-end developer, along with challenges and further recommended resources.

## About Learn web development

- Defines the essential skills and knowledge every front-end developer needs for career success and industry relevance.

- Created by the MDN community and refined with insights from students, educators, and developers from the broader web community.

- Designed to take you from "beginner" to "comfortable" (not "beginner" to "expert"), giving you enough knowledge to use more advanced resources (such as [the rest of MDN](/en-US/)).

> [!NOTE]
> Last updated: December 2024 ([see changelog](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Changelog)).

## Don't know where to get started?

  - : Our [Getting started modules](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started) provide setup tutorials and essential concepts and background information for complete beginners. You should start here if you are a complete beginner (i.e. you've not installed a code editor or written any code yet).
- Want to master the essentials?
  - : Our [Core modules](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core) provide a structured set of tutorials teaching the essential skills and practices for being a successful front-end developer.
- Beyond the basics?
  - : Our [Extension modules](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Extensions) cover useful additional skills to learn as you start to expand your knowledge and develop specialisms. Go onto these after you finish our Core.
