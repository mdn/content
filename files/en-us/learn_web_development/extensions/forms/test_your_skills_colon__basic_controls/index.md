## Basic controls 1

This task starts you off nice and gently by asking you to create two `<input>` elements, for a user's ID and password, along with a submit button.

1. Create appropriate inputs for user ID and password.
2. You should also associate them with their text labels semantically.
3. Create a submit button inside the remaining list item, with button text of "Log in".

## Basic controls 2

The next task requires you to create working sets of checkboxes and radio buttons, from the provided text labels.

1. Turn the first `<fieldset>`'s contents into a set of radio buttons — you should only be able to select one pony character at once.
2. Make it so that the first radio button is selected upon page load.
3. Turn the second `<fieldset>`'s content into a set of checkboxes.
4. Add a couple more hotdog choices of your own.

## Basic controls 3

The final task in this set requires you to create a file picker.

1. Create a basic file picker.
2. Allow the user to pick multiple files at once.
3. Allow the file picker to accept JPG and PNG images only.
