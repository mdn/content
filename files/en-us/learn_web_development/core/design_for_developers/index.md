The idea of this module is to (re-)introduce developers to design thinking. They may not want to work as designers, but having some basic user experience and design theory is good for everyone involved in building websites, no matter what their role. At the very least, even the most technical, "non-designer" developer should understand design briefs, why things are designed as they are, and be able to get into the mindset of the user. And it'll help them make their portfolios look better.

In addition, front-end developers are often tasked with doing various bits of design work on projects. Clients and employers often assume that they can do it because they are involved with the visual elements of the website. Historically, "web developer" used to be more of a hybrid designer/developer role than it is today.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should be familiar with [HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content) and [CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you could try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/) or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).

## Tutorials and challenges

- [Basic design theory](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Design_for_developers/Basic_design_theory)
  - : This article helps you make a start on the fundamental design theory that it's useful to know when design web interfaces. You don't have to be a master design to make a difference — with a little bit of knowledge, you can create a much improved user experience through careful use of fonts, color, whitespace, alignment, images, etc.
- [User-centered design](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Design_for_developers/User-centered_design)
  - : The overarching theory of **User-centered design** (UCD) is that everything we do as designers (and developers!) is for the user — understanding their needs, solving their problems, making their experience on the web better. This article provides an introduction to UCD, the kind of research you can do to better understand your user's needs, how UCD intersects with accessibility, and the common design patterns you'll encounter on the web.
- [Design briefs](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Design_for_developers/Design_briefs)
  - : As a developer, understanding design language and communicating with designers can lead to much better end results. This article looks at the mechanisms product designers use to communicate with developers — such as **design briefs**, **wireframes**, and **prototypes** — and how to interpret the information they contain to implement a feature.
