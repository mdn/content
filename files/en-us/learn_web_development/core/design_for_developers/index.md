The idea of this module is to (re-)introduce developers to design thinking. They may not want to work as designers, but having some basic user experience and design theory is good for everyone involved in building websites, no matter what their role. At the very least, even the most technical, "non-designer" developer should understand design briefs, why things are designed as they are, and be able to get into the mindset of the user. And it'll help them make their portfolios look better.

In addition, front-end developers are often tasked with doing various bits of design work on projects. Clients and employers often assume that they can do it because they are involved with the visual elements of the website. Historically, "web developer" used to be more of a hybrid designer/developer role than it is today.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should be familiar with [HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content) and [CSS](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics).

> [!NOTE]
> If you are working on a computer, tablet, or another device where you can't create files, you can try running the code in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).

## Tutorials and challenges

- [Basic design theory](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Design_for_developers/Basic_design_theory)
  - : This article helps you make a start on the fundamental design theory that it's useful to know when design web interfaces. You don't have to be a master design to make a difference — with a little bit of knowledge, you can create a much improved user experience through careful use of fonts, color, whitespace, alignment, images, etc.
- [User-centered design](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Design_for_developers/User-centered_design)
  - : The overarching theory of **User-centered design** (UCD) is that everything we do as designers (and developers!) is for the user — understanding their needs, solving their problems, making their experience on the web better. This article provides an introduction to UCD, the kind of research you can do to better understand your user's needs, how UCD intersects with accessibility, and the common design patterns you'll encounter on the web.
- [Interface designs](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Design_for_developers/Interface_designs)
  - : As a developer, understanding design language and how to communicate with designers can lead to much better end results. This article looks at the interface designs product designers use to communicate with developers and how to interpret the information they contain to implement a feature.
