As a developer, understanding design language and how to communicate with designers can lead to much better end results. This article looks at the interface designs product designers use to communicate with developers and how to interpret the information they contain to implement a feature.

## Speaking design language

We have covered many different design-related terms throughout this module. At this point, you should already be starting to get more comfortable with speaking design language. When designers start talking about scale, alignment, typography, color palettes, contrast, line height (or leading), visual hierarchy, etc., you should now know what they mean.

As a developer, this is important when you are trying to interpret the information designers give you to create an implementation from.

## What does an interface design contain?

Designers tend to work from **design briefs**. These are documents that communicate the details of a project or feature such as overall description, target audience, objectives, deadlines, use cases (or problems the design needs to solve), and expected design deliverables. They will also work from wireframes created by UX designers, which provide high-level ideas of how the interfaces are meant to behave.

The UI design that a designer will produce for you to implement a feature from will contain a lot of information, including the following:

- Colors used in the design.
- Sizes of all the different containers included in the design.
- Fonts used in the design.
- Images and other assets included in the design.
- Specifications of other included elements, such as background gradients.
- Details of any interactive UI elements, for example how the interface changes when a button is pressed, or where a link navigates to.

Often, a UI design will include multiple screens that provide a journey through the feature or app, showing each stage of the functionality.

As more design decisions are made, and the design starts to solidify, UI designers will often also create interactive prototypes that allow you to interact with controls and get an idea of how the final product will act.

## Design tools

Designers use a variety of tools to create UI designs and prototypes, such as [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), and [Canva](https://www.canva.com/).

## Summary

This brief article has given you an idea of what deliverables UI designers create, and how to use those deliverables to start implementing web features.
