The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand how to use [lesser-known HTML elements to mark up advanced semantic features](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Advanced_text_features).

## Task 1

In this task, we want you to add some semantics to the provided HTML as follows:

- Turn the second paragraph into a block-level quote, and semantically indicate that the quote is taken from [Accessibility](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility).
- Semantically mark up "HTML" and "CSS" as acronyms, providing expansions as tooltips.
- Use subscript and superscript to provide correct semantics for the chemical formulae and dates, and make them display correctly.
- Semantically associate machine-readable dates with the dates in the text.

The finished example should look like this:
