The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand how to mark up text in HTML to give it structure and meaning.

> [!NOTE]
> You can try solutions in the MDN Playground or in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).

> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Task 1

In this task, we want you to mark up the provided HTML using semantic heading and paragraph elements.

To get started, you can click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground, or [download the starting point for this task](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/tasks/basic-text/basic-text1-download.html) and work locally in your own editor.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution at the bottom of the section.

```html-nolint live-sample___text-basics-1
Basic HTML Animals

This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.

The Llama

Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.

The Anaconda

The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, traveling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
```

<!-- Shared/setup CSS code -->

```css hidden live-sample___text-basics-1 hidden live-sample___text-basics-2 live-sample___text-basics-3 live-sample___text-basics-4
body {
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #333;
  font:
    1em / 1.4 Helvetica Neue,
    Helvetica,
    Arial,
    sans-serif;
  padding: 1em;
  margin: 0;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
  margin: 0;
}

h2 {
  font-size: 1.6rem;
  margin: 0;
}

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

<!-- Example-specific code -->

```css hidden live-sample___text-basics-1
h1,
h2 {
  color: purple;
}

p {
  color: gray;
  margin: 0.5em 0;
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('text-basics-1', "100%", 130) }}

The finished example should look like this:
