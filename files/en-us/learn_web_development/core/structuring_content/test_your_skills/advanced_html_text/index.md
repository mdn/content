The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand how to use [lesser-known HTML elements to mark up advanced semantic features](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/Advanced_text_features).

> [!NOTE]
> You can try solutions in the MDN Playground or in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).
>
> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Task 1

In this task, we want you to add some semantics to the provided HTML as follows:

- Turn the second paragraph into a block-level quote, and semantically indicate that the quote is taken from [Accessibility](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility).
- Semantically mark up "HTML" and "CSS" as acronyms, providing expansions as tooltips.
- Use subscript and superscript to provide correct semantics for the chemical formulae and dates, and make them display correctly.
- Semantically associate machine-readable dates with the dates in the text.

To get started, you can click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground, or [download the starting point for this task](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/introduction-to-html/tasks/advanced-text/advanced-text2-download.html) and work locally in your own editor.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution at the bottom of the section.

```html live-sample___advanced-text
<h1>Advanced text semantics</h1>

<p>Let's start with a quote:</p>

<p>
  HTML, Hypertext Markup Language is by default accessible, if used correctly.
</p>

<p>CSS can also be used to make web pages more, or less, accessible.</p>

<p>Chemical Formulae: H2O (Water), C2H6O (Ethanol).</p>

<p>
  Dates: December 25th 2019 (Christmas Day), November 2nd 2019 (Día de los
  Muertos).
</p>
```

```css hidden live-sample___advanced-text
body {
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #333;
  font:
    1em / 1.4 Helvetica Neue,
    Helvetica,
    Arial,
    sans-serif;
  padding: 1em;
  margin: 0;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2rem;
  margin: 0;
  color: purple;
}

p {
  margin: 0.5em 0;
}

abbr,
time {
  color: green;
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('advanced-text', "100%", 260) }}

The finished example should look like this:

{{EmbedGHLiveSample("learning-area/html/introduction-to-html/tasks/advanced-text/advanced-text2-finished.html", '100%', 300)}}

Your finished HTML should look like this:

```html
<h1>Advanced text semantics</h1>

<p>Let's start with a quote:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility">
  <p>
    <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, Hypertext Markup
    Language is by default accessible, if used correctly.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, Cascading Style Sheets, can
  also be used to make web pages more, or less, accessible.
</p>

<p>
  Chemical Formulae: H<sub>2</sub>O (Water), C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>O
  (Ethanol).
</p>

<p>
  Dates:
  <time datetime="2019-12-25">December 25<sup>th</sup> 2019</time>

  <time datetime="2019-11-02">November 2<sup>nd</sup> 2019</time> (Día de los
