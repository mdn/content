The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you understand how to [embed video and audio content in HTML](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Structuring_content/HTML_video_and_audio).

> [!NOTE]
> You can try solutions in the MDN Playground or in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/), or [Glitch](https://glitch.com/).

> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Task 1

In this task, we want you to embed an audio file onto the page. You need to:

- Add the path to the audio file to an appropriate attribute to embed it on the page. The audio is called `audio.mp3`, and it available at a path of `https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/raw/refs/heads/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/tasks/media-embed/media/audio.mp3`.
- Add an attribute to make browsers display some default controls.
- Add some appropriate fallback text for browsers that don't support `<audio>`.

To get started, you can click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground, or [download the starting point for this task](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/tasks/media-embed/mediaembed1-download.html) and work locally in your own editor.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution at the bottom of the section.

```html live-sample___audio-1
<h1>Basic audio embed</h1>

<audio></audio>
```

<!-- Shared styles -->

```css hidden live-sample___video-1 live-sample___audio-1
body {
  background-color: #fff;
  color: #333;
  font:
    1em / 1.4 Helvetica Neue,
    Helvetica,
    Arial,
    sans-serif;
  padding: 1em;
  margin: 0;
}

* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

audio,
video {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample('audio-1', "100%", 150) }}

Your finished HTML should look like this:

```html
<h1>Basic audio embed</h1>

<audio
  controls
  src="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/raw/refs/heads/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/tasks/media-embed/media/audio.mp3">

    Your browser doesn't support HTML audio.

    >
    instead.
  </p>
</audio>
```

## Task 2

In this task, we want you to mark up a slightly more complex video player, with multiple sources, subtitles, and other features besides. You need to:

- Add an attribute to make browsers display some default controls.
- Add some appropriate fallback text for browsers that don't support `<video>`.
- Add multiple sources, containing the paths to the video files. The files are called `video.mp4` and `video.webm`, and are available at the following paths:
  - `https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/raw/refs/heads/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/tasks/media-embed/media/video.mp4`
  - `https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/raw/refs/heads/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/tasks/media-embed/media/video.webm`
- Let the browser know in advance what video formats the sources point to, so it can make an informed choice of which one to download ahead of time.
- Give the `<video>` a width and height equal to its intrinsic size (320 by 240 pixels).
- Make the video muted by default.
- Display the text tracks contained in the `media` folder, in a file called `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/learning-area/refs/heads/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/tasks/media-embed/media/subtitles_en.vtt`, when the video is playing. You must explicitly set the type as subtitles, and the subtitle language to English.
- Make sure the readers can identify the subtitle language when they use the default controls.

To get started, you can click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground, or [download the starting point for this task](https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/main/html/multimedia-and-embedding/tasks/media-embed/mediaembed2-download.html) and work locally in your own editor.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution at the bottom of the section.
