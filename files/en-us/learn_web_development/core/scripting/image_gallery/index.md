In this challenge, we'll get you to build a fairly common item you'll see on a lot of websites â€” a JavaScript-powered image gallery. Along the way, you'll be tested on your knowledge of loops, functions, conditionals, events, DOM scripting, and object basics.

## Starting point

To begin, click the **Play** button in one of the code panels below to open the provided example in the MDN Playground. You'll then follow the instructions in the [Project brief](#project_brief) section to complete the JavaScript functionality.

The HTML looks like so:

```html live-sample___gallery-start live-sample___gallery-finish
<h1>Image gallery example</h1>

<div class="full-img">
  <img
    class="displayed-img"
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/gallery/pic1.jpg"
    alt="Closeup of a human eye" />
  <div class="overlay"></div>
  <button class="dark">Darken</button>
</div>

<div class="thumb-bar"></div>
```

The starting JavaScript looks like this:

```js live-sample___gallery-start
const displayedImage = document.querySelector(".displayed-img");
const thumbBar = document.querySelector(".thumb-bar");

const btn = document.querySelector("button");
const overlay = document.querySelector(".overlay");

// 1. Declare an array of objects containing image file names & alt text

// 2. Loop through the images

// 3. Create the updateDisplayedImage() function

// 4. Wire up the Darken/Lighten button
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("gallery-start", "100%", 700)}}

```css hidden live-sample___gallery-start live-sample___gallery-finish
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
  width: 640px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  background-color: lightgray;
}

h1 {
  text-align: center;
}

.full-img {
  position: relative;
  display: block;
  width: 640px;
  height: 480px;
  margin-bottom: 2px;
}

.overlay {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 640px;
  height: 480px;
}

button {
  background: rgb(150 150 150 / 0.6);
  border: 1px solid #999999;
  position: absolute;
  cursor: pointer;
  top: 2px;
  left: 2px;
}

button:hover,
button:focus {
  color: rgb(150 150 150 / 1);
  background-color: black;
}

.thumb-bar {
  display: flex;
  gap: 2px;
  cursor: pointer;
}

.thumb-bar img {
  display: block;
  width: 100px;
  flex: 1;
}

.thumb-bar img:hover,
.thumb-bar img:focus {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}
```

We've hidden the gallery CSS for brevity, but you can see it when you look at the app in the MDN Playground.

## Project brief

You have been provided with some HTML, CSS, and a few lines of JavaScript code. Your job is to follow the instructions below, writing the necessary JavaScript to turn this into a working image gallery.

The gallery will consist of a large image and a row of thumbnails. When a thumbnail is clicked or tabbed to and <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Return</kbd> then pressed, that thumb should then display as the large image. The relevant `<img>` element should also be updated with the correct `alt` text.

In the top-left corner there is a button that, when repeatedly pressed, toggles the large image between a darker and lighter tint, achieved by changing the transparency of a `<div>` element that has been overlaid on top of the large image.

The images you need to embed in the example and their required `alt` text are as follows:

- [`pic1.jpg`](https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/gallery/pic1.jpg): "Closeup of a human eye".
- [`pic2.jpg`](https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/gallery/pic2.jpg): "Rock that looks like a wave".
- [`pic3.jpg`](https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/gallery/pic3.jpg): "Purple and white pansies".
- [`pic4.jpg`](https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/gallery/pic4.jpg): "Section of wall from a pharoah's tomb".
- [`pic5.jpg`](https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/gallery/pic5.jpg): "Large moth on a leaf".

### Create a data object

First of all, we'd like you to declare an array of objects called `images`. Each object should contain two properties:

- `filename`: The name of the image file (not the full URL).
- `alt`: The image's `alt` text.

### Add the images to the thumbnail bar

Next, we want you to loop through the `images` and use some DOM scripting to embed them all on the page via `<img>` elements. They should be included as children of the `<div>` element with the class of `thumb-bar`, which we've already referenced in the `thumbBar` constant.

1. Create a constant called `baseURL` containing the base URL of each image file (all of the URL not including the filename).
2. Create a `for ... of` loop to loop through the `images`.
3. For each image, create a new `<img>` element.
4. Set the `<img>` source to equal the URL of the image, which should be a combination of the `baseURL` and the `filename`, and the `alt` attribute equal to the `alt` text.
5. Add another attribute to the `<img>` to make it focusable via the keyword.
6. Append the `<img>` to the `thumbBar`.
7. Add a `click` event handler to the `<img>` so that when it is clicked, a function called `updateDisplayedImage()` is run, which displays the clicked image at full size. You'll create this function later on.
8. Add another event handler to the `<img>` so that once it is focused via the keyboard, the clicked image can be displayed at full size by pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Return</kbd> key (and no other key). This is a stretch goal that will take a bit of research to figure out.

### Create the `updateDisplayedImage()` function

Now it's time to create the function to display an activated thumbnail at full size. We've stored a reference to the full size `<img>` element in the `displayedImage` constant.

1. Define the `updateDisplayedImage()` function.
2. Inside the function body, set the `displayedImage` source to equal the source of the `<img>` that was activated.
3. Set the `displayedImage` alt text to equal the alt text of the `<img>` that was activated.

### Wire up the Darken/Lighten button

We've stored a reference to the "Darken/Lighten" `<button>` in the `btn` constant, and a reference to the transparent `<div>` we have overlaid on top of the full size `<img>` in the `overlay` constant. We'd like you to:

1. Add a `click` event handler to the `<button>` with an anonymous function set as the handler function.
2. Inside the function body, add a conditional structure that tests whether the `<button>` has a `class` set on it of `dark` or not.
3. If the `<button>` has a `class` of `dark` when clicked, change its text content to `Lighten`, and change the `overlay` element's background color to `rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5)`. Remove the `<button>` element's `dark` class.
4. If the `<button>` _does not_ have a `class` of `dark` when clicked, change its text content to `Darken`, and change the `overlay` element's background color to `rgb(0 0 0 / 0)`. Add the `<button>` element's `dark` class.
5. Can you think of a way to toggle the `dark` class using a single line of code, run after the conditional structure? This is another stretch goal, but give it a go.

## Hints and tips

- You don't need to change the HTML or CSS.

## Example

Your finished app should work like the following live example:

{{EmbedLiveSample("gallery-finish", "100%", 700)}}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

The finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js live-sample___gallery-finish
const displayedImage = document.querySelector(".displayed-img");
const thumbBar = document.querySelector(".thumb-bar");

const btn = document.querySelector("button");
const overlay = document.querySelector(".overlay");

// 1. Declare an array of objects containing image file names & alt text

const images = [
  { filename: "pic1.jpg", alt: "Closeup of a human eye" },
  { filename: "pic2.jpg", alt: "Rock that looks like a wave" },
  { filename: "pic3.jpg", alt: "Purple and white pansies" },
  { filename: "pic4.jpg", alt: "Section of wall from a pharoah's tomb" },
  { filename: "pic5.jpg", alt: "Large moth on a leaf" },
];

// 2. Loop through the images

// 2a. Create a baseURL constant containing the baseURL of the images
const baseURL =
  "https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/learn/gallery/";

// 2b. Loop through the images using a for...of loop
for (const image of images) {
  // 2c. Create a new image element
  const newImage = document.createElement("img");
  // 2d. Set the source and alt text for the image
  newImage.src = `${baseURL}${image.filename}`;
  newImage.alt = image.alt;
  // 2e. Make the image focusable via the keyboard
  newImage.tabIndex = "0";
  // 2f. Append the image as a child of the thumbBar
  thumbBar.appendChild(newImage);
  // 2g. Update the display to show the image fullsize when a thumb is clicked
  newImage.addEventListener("click", updateDisplayedImage);
  // 2h. Update the display to show the image fullsize when the "Enter" key
  // is pressed after it has been focused
  newImage.addEventListener("keydown", (e) => {
    if (e.code === "Enter") {
      updateDisplayedImage(e);
    }
  });
}

// 3. Create the updateDisplayedImage() function

function updateDisplayedImage(e) {
  displayedImage.src = e.target.src;
  displayedImage.alt = e.target.alt;
}

// 4. Wire up the Darken/Lighten button

// 4a. Add a click event listener on the button
btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
  // 4b. If the button has a "dark" class set,
  // change text to "Lighten" and make the overlay darker
  if (btn.classList.contains("dark")) {
    btn.textContent = "Lighten";
    overlay.style.backgroundColor = "rgb(0 0 0 / 0.5)";
  } else {
    // 4b. Else, change text to "Darken" and make
    // the overlay lighter
    btn.textContent = "Darken";
    overlay.style.backgroundColor = "rgb(0 0 0 / 0)";
  }
  // 4c. Toggle the class ready for the next button press
  btn.classList.toggle("dark");
});
```
