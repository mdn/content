The aim of this skill test is to help you assess whether you've understood our [Storing the information you need — Variables](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Variables) article.

> [!NOTE]
> To get help, read our [Test your skills](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development#test_your_skills) usage guide. You can also reach out to us using one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Interactive challenge

First of all, we are giving you a fun, interactive variables challenge created by our [learning partner](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Learning_content#partner_links_and_embeds), [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home).

Watch the embedded scrim, and complete the task on the timeline (the little ghost icon) by following the instructions and editing the code. When you are done, you can resume watching the scrim to check how the teacher's solution matches up with yours.

## Task 1

To complete this task, add a new line to correct the value stored in the existing `myName` variable to your own name.

<!-- Code shared across examples -->

```html hidden live-sample___variables-1 live-sample___variables-2
<section></section>
```

```css hidden live-sample___variables-1 live-sample___variables-2
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

p {
  color: purple;
  margin: 0.5em 0;
}
```

<!-- Example-specific code -->

```js live-sample___variables-1
let myName = "Paul";

// Don't edit the code above here!

// Add your code here

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");
const para = document.createElement("p");
para.textContent = myName;
section.appendChild(para);
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("variables-1", "100%", 60) }}

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
// ...
// Don't edit the code above here!

myName = "Chris";

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

</details>

## Task 2

The final task for now — in this case you are provided with some existing code, which has two errors present in it. The results panel should be outputting the name `Chris`, and a statement about how old Chris will be in 20 years' time. We want you to fix the problem and correct the output.

```js live-sample___variables-2
// Fix the following code

const myName = "Default";
myName = "Chris";

let myAge = "42";

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");
const para1 = document.createElement("p");
const para2 = document.createElement("p");
para1.textContent = myName;
para2.textContent = `In 20 years, I will be ${myAge + 20}`;
section.appendChild(para1);
section.appendChild(para2);
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("variables-2", "100%", 60) }}

<details>
<summary>Click here to show the solution</summary>

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js
// Turn the const into a let, so the value can be changed
let myName = "Default";
myName = "Chris";

// myAge needs to have a number datatype
let myAge = 42;

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

</details>
