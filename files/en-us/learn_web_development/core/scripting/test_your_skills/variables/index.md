The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our [Storing the information you need — Variables](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Variables) article.

> [!NOTE]
> For Tasks 1 and 2, you can try solutions in the interactive editors on this page or in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).
> If there is an error in your code, it will be logged into the results panel on this page or in the JavaScript console.
>
> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Interactive challenge

First of all, we are giving you a fun, interactive variables challenge created by our [learning partner](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Learning_content#partner_links_and_embeds), [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home).

Watch the embedded scrim, and complete the task on the timeline (the little ghost icon) by following the instructions and editing the code. When you are done, you can resume watching the scrim to check how the teacher's solution matches up with yours.

## Task 1

In this task you need to add a new line to correct the value stored in the existing `myName` variable to your own name.

Try updating the live code below to recreate the finished example:

## Task 2

The final task for now — in this case you are provided with some existing code, which has two errors present in it. The results panel should be outputting the name `Chris`, and a statement about how old Chris will be in 20 years' time. How can you fix the problem and correct the output?
