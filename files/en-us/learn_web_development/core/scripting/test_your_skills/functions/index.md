The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our [Functions — reusable blocks of code](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Functions), [Build your own function](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Build_your_own_function), and [Function return values](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Return_values) articles.

> [!NOTE]
> For Tasks 1–4, you can try solutions by downloading the code and putting it in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).
> If there is an error, it will be logged in the results panel on the page or into the browser's JavaScript console to help you.
>
> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## DOM manipulation: considered useful

Some of the questions below require you to write some [DOM](/en-US/docs/Glossary/DOM) manipulation code to complete them — such as creating new HTML elements, setting their text contents to equal specific string values, and nesting them inside existing elements on the page — all via JavaScript.

We haven't explicitly taught this yet in the course, but you'll have seen some examples that make use of it, and we'd like you to do some research into what DOM APIs you need to successfully answer the questions. A good starting place is our [DOM scripting introduction](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/DOM_scripting) tutorial.

## Interactive challenge

First of all, we are giving you a fun, interactive challenge involving function return values, created by our [learning partner](/en-US/docs/MDN/Writing_guidelines/Learning_content#partner_links_and_embeds), [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/home).

Watch the embedded scrim, and complete the task on the timeline (the little ghost icon) by following the instructions and editing the code. When you are done, you can resume watching the scrim to check how the teacher's solution matches up with yours.

## Task 1

To complete our first functions task:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Define a function—`chooseName()`—that prints a random name from the provided array (`names`) into the provided paragraph (`para`).
3. Call the `chooseName()` function once.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution below the live output.

  const choice = names[randomNumber];
  para.textContent = choice;
}

chooseName();
```

</details>

## Task 2

This task requires you to define a function that draws onto a `<canvas>` element.

To complete the task:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Create a function that draws a rectangle on the provided `<canvas>` (reference variable `canvas`, context available in `ctx`), based on the five provided input variables:
   - `x` — the x coordinate of the rectangle.
   - `y` — the y coordinate of the rectangle.
   - `width` — the width of the rectangle.
   - `height` — the height of the rectangle.
   - `color` — the color of the rectangle.

```js live-sample___functions-2
const canvas = document.querySelector("canvas");
const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
const x = 50;
const y = 60;
const width = 100;
const height = 75;
const color = "blue";

  ctx.fillStyle = color;
  ctx.fillRect(x, y, width, height);
}

drawSquare(x, y, width, height, color);
```

## Task 3

In this task, you return to the problem posed in Task 1, with the aim of making three improvements to it.

To complete the task:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Refactor the code that generates the random number into a separate function called `random()`, which takes as parameters two generic bounds that the random number should be between, and returns the result.
3. Update the `chooseName()` function so that it makes use of the random number function, takes the array to choose from as a parameter (making it more flexible), and returns the result.
4. Print the returned result into the paragraph (`para`)'s `textContent`.

const para = document.querySelector("p");

  const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * names.length);
  const choice = names[randomNumber];

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

// ...

function random(min, max) {
  const num = Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min)) + min;
  return num;
}

function chooseItem(array) {
  const choice = array[random(0, array.length)];
  return choice;
}

para.textContent = chooseItem(names);
```

</details>

## Task 4

In this task, we have an array of names, and we're using {{jsxref("Array.filter()")}} to get an array containing only the names shorter than 5 characters. The filter is currently being passed a named function `isShort()`. This checks the length of the name, returning `true` if the name is less than 5 characters long, and `false` otherwise.

To complete the task:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Update the code so that the functionality inside `isShort()` is instead included directly inside the `filter()` call as an arrow function. See how compact you can make it.
