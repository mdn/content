The aim of this skill test is to assess whether you've understood our [Handling text — strings in JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Strings) and [Useful string methods](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Useful_string_methods) articles.

> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Strings 1

In our first strings task, we start off small. You already have half of a famous quote inside a variable called `quoteStart`, and we want you to complete it.

To complete the task:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Look up the other half of the quote, and add it to the example inside a variable called `quoteEnd`.
3. Concatenate the two strings together to make a single string containing the complete quote. Save the result inside a variable called `finalQuote`.
4. You'll find that you get an error at this point. Can you fix the problem with `quoteStart`, so that the full quote displays correctly?

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution below the live output.

<!-- Code shared across examples -->

```js-nolint live-sample___strings-1

// Add your code here

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js-nolint
// You need to escape the quote
const quoteStart = 'Don\'t judge each day by the harvest you reap ';

const quoteEnd = "but by the seeds that you plant.";

const finalQuote = `${quoteStart}${quoteEnd}`;

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

</details>

## Strings 2

In this task you are provided with two variables, `quote` and `substring`, which contain two strings.

To complete the task:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Retrieve the length of the quote, and store it in a variable called `quoteLength`.
3. Find the index position where `substring` appears in `quote`, and store that value in a variable called `index`.
4. Use a combination of the variables you have and available string properties/methods to trim down the original quote to "I do not like green eggs and ham.", and store it in a variable called `revisedQuote`.

```js live-sample___strings-2
const quote = "I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam-I-Am.";
const substring = "green eggs and ham";

// Don't edit the code above here!

// Add your code here

// Don't edit the code below here!

const section = document.querySelector("section");
section.innerHTML = " ";
const para1 = document.createElement("p");
para1.textContent = `The quote is ${quoteLength} characters long.`;
const para2 = document.createElement("p");
para2.textContent = revisedQuote;
section.appendChild(para1);
section.appendChild(para2);
```

Your finished JavaScript should look something like this:

```js

// Don't edit the code above here!

const quoteLength = quote.length;
const index = quote.indexOf(substring);
const revisedQuote = quote.slice(0, index + substring.length + 1);

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

</details>

## Strings 3

In the next string task, you are given the same quote that you ended up with in the previous task, but it is somewhat broken! We want you to fix and update it.

To complete the task:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Change the casing to correct sentence case (all lowercase, except for upper case first letter). Store the new quote in a variable called `fixedQuote`.
3. In `fixedQuote`, replace "green eggs and ham" with another food that you really don't like.
4. There is one more small fix to do — add a period to the end of the quote, and save the final version in a variable called `finalQuote`.

let fixedQuote = quote.toLowerCase();
const firstLetter = fixedQuote.slice(0, 1);
fixedQuote = fixedQuote.replace(firstLetter, firstLetter.toUpperCase());
fixedQuote = fixedQuote.replace("green eggs and ham", "pickled onions");
const finalQuote = `${fixedQuote}.`;

// Don't edit the code below here!
// ...
```

## Strings 4

In the final string task, we have given you the name of a theorem, two numeric values, and an incomplete string (the bits that need adding are marked with asterisks (`*`)). We want you to change the value of the string.

To complete the task:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Change the string from a regular string literal into a template literal.
3. Replace the four asterisks with four template literal embedded expressions. These should be:
   1. The name of the theorem.
   2. The two number values we have.
   3. The length of the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle, assuming the two other side lengths are the same as the two values we have. You'll need to look up how to calculate this from what you have. Do the calculation inside the placeholder.
