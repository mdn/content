You've already seen how, in {{Glossary("CSS")}}, selectors are used to target the {{glossary("HTML")}} elements on our web pages that we want to style. There are a wide variety of CSS selectors available, allowing for fine-grained precision when selecting elements to style, and in the next few articles we'll look at the different types in depth. In this article we'll recap some selector fundamentals, including the basic type, class, and ID selectors, and selector lists. We'll also introduce the universal selector.

## What is a selector?

A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them. The element or elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the _subject of the selector_.

In earlier articles you may have met some different selectors, and learned that there are selectors that target the document in different ways — for example by selecting an element such as `h1`, or a class such as `.special`. Let's start off by recapping the main ones you've already seen.

## Type selectors

A **type selector** is sometimes referred to as a _tag name selector_ or _element selector_ because it selects an HTML tag/element in your document. In the example below, we have used the `span`, `em` and `strong` selectors.

Try adding a CSS rule to select the `<h1>` element and change its color to blue:

```html live-sample___type
<h1>Type selectors</h1>
<p>
  Veggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis
  <span>kohlrabi welsh onion</span> daikon amaranth tatsoi tomatillo melon azuki
  bean garlic.
</p>

<p>
  Gumbo beet greens corn soko <strong>endive</strong> gumbo gourd. Parsley
  shallot courgette tatsoi pea sprouts fava bean collard greens dandelion okra
  wakame tomato. Dandelion cucumber earthnut pea peanut soko zucchini.
</p>

<p>
  Turnip greens yarrow ricebean rutabaga <em>endive cauliflower</em> sea lettuce
  kohlrabi amaranth water spinach avocado daikon napa cabbage asparagus winter
  purslane kale. Celery potato scallion desert raisin horseradish spinach
</p>
```

```css live-sample___type
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

span {
  background-color: yellow;
}

strong {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}

em {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("type", "", "280px")}}

## Class selectors

The case-sensitive class selector starts with a dot (`.`) character. It will select everything in the document with that class applied to it. In the live example below we have created a class called `highlight`, and have applied it to several places in my document. All of the elements that have the class applied are highlighted.

```html live-sample___class
<h1 class="highlight">Class selectors</h1>
<p>
  Veggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis
  <span class="highlight">kohlrabi welsh onion</span> daikon amaranth tatsoi
  tomatillo melon azuki bean garlic.
</p>

<p class="highlight">
  Gumbo beet greens corn soko <strong>endive</strong> gumbo gourd. Parsley
  shallot courgette tatsoi pea sprouts fava bean collard greens dandelion okra
  wakame tomato. Dandelion cucumber earthnut pea peanut soko zucchini.
</p>
```

```css live-sample___class
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("class", "", "220px")}}

### Targeting classes on particular elements

You can create a selector that will target specific elements with the class applied. In this next example, we will highlight a `<span>` with a class of `highlight` differently to an `<h1>` heading with a class of `highlight`. We do this by using the type selector for the element we want to target, with the class appended using a dot, with no white space in between.

```html live-sample___class-type
<h1 class="highlight">Class selectors</h1>
<p>
  Veggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis
  <span class="highlight">kohlrabi welsh onion</span> daikon amaranth tatsoi
  tomatillo melon azuki bean garlic.
</p>

<p class="highlight">
  Gumbo beet greens corn soko <strong>endive</strong> gumbo gourd. Parsley
  shallot courgette tatsoi pea sprouts fava bean collard greens dandelion okra
  wakame tomato. Dandelion cucumber earthnut pea peanut soko zucchini.
</p>
```

```css live-sample___class-type
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

span.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}

h1.highlight {
  background-color: pink;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("class-type", "", "200px")}}

This approach reduces the scope of a rule. The rule will only apply to that particular element and class combination. You would need to add another selector if you decided the rule should apply to other elements too.

### Target an element if it has more than one class applied

You can apply multiple classes to an element and target them individually, or only select the element when all of the classes in the selector are present. This can be helpful when building up components that can be combined in different ways on your site.

In the example below, we have a `<div>` that contains a note. The grey border is applied when the box has a class of `notebox`. If it also has a class of `warning` or `danger`, we change the {{cssxref("border-color")}}.

We can tell the browser that we only want to match the element if it has two classes applied by chaining them together with no white space between them. You'll see that the last `<div>` doesn't get any styling applied, as it only has the `danger` class; it needs `notebox` as well to get anything applied.

```html live-sample___class-many
<div class="notebox">This is an informational note.</div>

<div class="notebox warning">This note shows a warning.</div>

<div class="notebox danger">This note shows danger!</div>

<div class="danger">
  This won't get styled — it also needs to have the notebox class
</div>
```

```css live-sample___class-many
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

.notebox {
  border: 4px solid #666;
  padding: 0.5em;
  margin: 0.5em;
}

.notebox.warning {
  border-color: orange;
  font-weight: bold;
}

.notebox.danger {
  border-color: red;
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("class-many", "", "200px")}}

## ID selectors

The case-sensitive ID selector begins with a `#` rather than a dot character, but is used in the same way as a class selector. The difference is that an ID can be used only once per page, and elements can only have a single `id` value applied to them. It can select an element that has the `id` set on it, and you can precede the ID with a type selector to only target the element if both the element and ID match. You can see both of these uses in the following example:

```html live-sample___id
<h1 id="heading">ID selector</h1>
<p>
  Veggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis kohlrabi welsh onion
  daikon amaranth tatsoi tomatillo melon azuki bean garlic.
</p>

<p id="one">
  Gumbo beet greens corn soko <strong>endive</strong> gumbo gourd. Parsley
  shallot courgette tatsoi pea sprouts fava bean collard greens dandelion okra
  wakame tomato. Dandelion cucumber earthnut pea peanut soko zucchini.
</p>
```

```css live-sample___id
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

#one {
  background-color: yellow;
}

h1#heading {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("id", "", "200px")}}

> [!WARNING]
> Using the same ID multiple times in a document may appear to work for styling purposes, but don't do this. It results in invalid code, and will cause strange behavior in many places.

## Selector lists

If you have more than one thing which uses the same CSS then the individual selectors can be combined into a _selector list_ so that the rule is applied to all of the individual selectors. For example, if I have the same CSS for an `h1` and also a class of `.special`, I could write this as two separate rules.

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
}

.special {
  color: blue;
}
```

I could also combine these into a selector list, by adding a comma between them.

```css-nolint
h1, .special {
  color: blue;
}
```

White space is valid before or after the comma. You may also find the selectors more readable if each is on a new line.

```css
h1,
.special {
  color: blue;
}
```

In the live example below try combining the two selectors which have identical declarations. The visual display should be the same after combining them.

```html live-sample___selector-list
<h1>Type selectors</h1>
<p>
  Veggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis
  <span>kohlrabi welsh onion</span> daikon amaranth tatsoi tomatillo melon azuki
  bean garlic.
</p>

<p>
  Gumbo beet greens corn soko <strong>endive</strong> gumbo gourd. Parsley
  shallot courgette tatsoi pea sprouts fava bean collard greens dandelion okra
  wakame tomato. Dandelion cucumber earthnut pea peanut soko zucchini.
</p>

<p>
  Turnip greens yarrow ricebean rutabaga <em>endive cauliflower</em> sea lettuce
  kohlrabi amaranth water spinach avocado daikon napa cabbage asparagus winter
  purslane kale. Celery potato scallion desert raisin horseradish spinach
</p>
```

```css live-sample___selector-list
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
span {
  background-color: yellow;
}

strong {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}

em {
  color: rebeccapurple;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("selector-list", "", "280px")}}

When you group selectors in this way, if any selector is syntactically invalid, the whole rule will be ignored.

In the following example, the invalid class selector rule will be ignored, whereas the `h1` would still be styled.

```css-nolint
h1 {
  color: blue;
}

..special {
  color: blue;
}
```

When combined however, neither the `h1` nor the class will be styled as the entire rule is deemed invalid.

```css-nolint
h1, ..special {
  color: blue;
}
```

## The universal selector

The universal selector is indicated by an asterisk (`*`). It selects everything in the document. If `*` is chained using a [descendant combinator](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Descendant_combinator), it selects everything inside that ancestor element. For example, `p *` selects all the nested elements inside the `<p>` element.

In the following example, we use the universal selector to remove the margins on all elements. Instead of the browser's default styling, which spaces out headings and paragraphs with margins, everything is close together.

```html live-sample___universal
<h1>Universal selector</h1>
<p>
  Veggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis
  <span>kohlrabi welsh onion</span> daikon amaranth tatsoi tomatillo melon azuki
  bean garlic.
</p>

<p>
  Gumbo beet greens corn soko <strong>endive</strong> gumbo gourd. Parsley
  shallot courgette tatsoi pea sprouts fava bean collard greens dandelion okra
  wakame tomato. Dandelion cucumber earthnut pea peanut soko zucchini.
</p>
```

```css live-sample___universal
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}

* {
  margin: 0;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("universal")}}

This kind of behavior can sometimes be seen in "reset stylesheets", which strip out all of the browser styling. Since the universal selector makes global changes, we use it for very specific situations, such as the one described below.

### Using the universal selector to make your selectors easier to read

One use of the universal selector is to make selectors easier to read and more obvious in terms of what they are doing. For example, if we wanted to select any descendant elements of an `<article>` element that are the first child of their parent, including direct children, and make them bold, we could use the {{cssxref(":first-child")}} pseudo-class. We will learn more about this in the lesson on [pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Pseudo_classes_and_elements):

```css
article :first-child {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

However, this selector could be confused with `article:first-child`, which will select any `<article>` element that is the first child of another element.

To avoid this confusion, we can add the universal selector to the `:first-child` pseudo-class, so it is more obvious what the selector is doing. It is selecting _any_ element which is the first-child of an `<article>` element, or the first-child of any descendant element of `<article>`:

```css
article *:first-child {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

Although both do the same thing, the readability is significantly improved.
