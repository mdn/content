The aim of this skill test is to help you assess whether you understand [overflow in CSS and how to manage it](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Overflow).

> [!NOTE]
> To get help, read our [Test your skills](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development#test_your_skills) usage guide. You can also reach out to us using one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## Task 1

In this task, the content is overflowing the box because it has a fixed height.

To complete the task:

1. Update the CSS so that the height is maintained and the box will have scrollbars only if there is enough text to cause an overflow.
2. Test your solution by removing some of the text from the HTML and checking that if there is only a small amount of text that does not overflow, no scrollbar appears.

Your final result should look like the image below:

![A small box with a border and a vertical scrollbar.](mdn-overflow1.png)

```html live-sample___overflow-scroll
<div class="box">
  <p>
    Veggies es bonus vobis, proinde vos postulo essum magis kohlrabi welsh onion
    daikon amaranth tatsoi tomatillo melon azuki bean garlic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gumbo beet greens corn soko endive gumbo gourd. Parsley shallot courgette
    tatsoi pea sprouts fava bean collard greens dandelion okra wakame tomato.
    Dandelion cucumber earthnut pea peanut soko zucchini.
  </p>
</div>
```

```css live-sample___overflow-scroll
body {
  font: 1.2em / 1.5 sans-serif;
}

.box {
  border: 5px solid black;
  padding: 1em;
  height: 200px;
  width: 300px;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("overflow-scroll", "", "450px")}}

You should add `overflow: auto` so that the box will only gain scrollbars when the content is too large:

```css
.box {
  overflow: auto;
}
```

</details>

## Task 2

In this task, there is an image in the box that is bigger than the dimensions of the box so that it overflows visibly. Update the CSS so that any image outside of the box is hidden.

Your final result should look like the image below:

![A box with an image which fills the box but does not spill out the edges.](mdn-overflow2.png)

```html live-sample___overflow-hidden
<div class="box">
  <img
    alt="flowers"
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/flowers.jpg" />
</div>
```

```css live-sample___overflow-hidden
body {
  font: 1.2em / 1.5 sans-serif;
}
.box {
  border: 5px solid black;
  height: 200px;
  width: 300px;
}
```

{{EmbedLiveSample("overflow-hidden", "", "300px")}}

```
