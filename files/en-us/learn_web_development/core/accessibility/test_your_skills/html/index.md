The aim of this skill test is to help you assess whether you've understood our [HTML: A good basis for accessibility](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Accessibility/HTML) article.

> [!NOTE]
> You can try solutions in the interactive editors on this page or in an online editor such as [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) or [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/).

> If you get stuck, you can reach out to us in one of our [communication channels](/en-US/docs/MDN/Community/Communication_channels).

## HTML accessibility 1

In this task we will test your understanding of semantic HTML, and why it is good for accessibility. The given text is an information panel with action buttons, but the HTML is really bad.

To complete the task:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Update the markup to use appropriate semantic HTML. You don't need to worry too much about recreating the _exact_ same look and text sizing, as long as the semantics are good.

If you make a mistake, you can clear your work using the _Reset_ button in the MDN Playground. If you get really stuck, you can view the solution below the live output.

```

Bonus points for:

- Just using `<button>`, not `<button class="button">` (repeating semantics is unnecessary), and updating the CSS selector to make sure the button still picks up the styles.
- Using an unordered list, not an ordered list — the list of items doesn't really need to be in any order.

## HTML accessibility 2

In the second task, you have a form containing three input fields.

To complete the task:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Semantically associate the inputs with their labels.
3. Assume that these inputs will be part of a larger form, and wrap them in an element that associates them all together as a single related group.
4. Give the group a description/title that summarizes all of the information as personal data.

```

## HTML accessibility 3

In this task you are required to turn all the information links in the paragraph into good, accessible links.

- The first two links just go to regular web pages.
- The third link goes to a PDF, and it's large — 8MB.
- The fourth link goes to a Word document, so the user will need some kind of application installed that can handle that.

To complete the task:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Update the links appropriately, based on the above descriptions.

## HTML accessibility 4

In our final HTML accessibility task, you are given an image gallery, which has some accessibility problems. Can you fix them?

- The header image has an accessibility issue, and so do the gallery images.
- You could take the header image further and implement it using CSS for arguably better accessibility. How would you create such a solution?

To complete the task:

1. Click **"Play"** in the code block below to edit the example in the MDN Playground.
2. Update the code to fix the problems described above.

```html live-sample___html-ally-4
<header>
  <img
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/star-pink_32x32.png"
    alt="A star that I use to decorate my page" />
  <h1>Groovy images</h1>
</header>
<main>
  <img
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/ballon-portrait.jpg" />
  <img
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/grapefruit-slice.jpg" />
</main>
```

```css live-sample___html-ally-4
body {
  width: 400px;
  margin: 0 auto;
}

main img {
  display: block;
  width: 250px;
  margin: 20px auto;
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 0 black;
}

header {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

{{ EmbedLiveSample("html-ally-4", "100%", 400) }}

The accessibility issues are:

1. The header image is decorative, so doesn't need alt text. The best solution if you are going to use decorative HTML images is to put `alt=""`, so a screen reader will just read out nothing — rather than a description, or the image file name. It is not part of the content.
2. The gallery images need alt text, and they are part of the content.

The updated HTML could look something like this:

```html
<header>
  <img
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/star-pink_32x32.png"
    alt="" />
  <h1>Groovy images</h1>
</header>
<main>
  <img
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/ballon-portrait.jpg"
    alt="a hot air balloon covered in a blue and while checked pattern" />
  <img
    src="https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/grapefruit-slice.jpg"
    alt="A cross-section of the middle of a pink grapefruit" />
</main>
```

It would be arguably better to implement the background header image using CSS background images. To do so, you would remove the first `<img>` element from the markup, and add a rule to the CSS like this:

```css
h1 {
  background: url(https://mdn.github.io/shared-assets/images/examples/star-pink_32x32.png)
    no-repeat left;
  padding-left: 50px;
}
```
