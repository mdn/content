Beginners often focus on specific individual aspects of technology, but miss out on the bigger picture of an overall project. This article provides some of that high-level context.

An important aspect of technical projects that beginners often miss out on is an idea of the bigger picture of a project. They might learn an individual tool or language and understand what they need to do, but be unaware of all the other codebases, tools, systems, and job roles that go together to deliver an entire web application. The following sections cover different big picture aspects.
