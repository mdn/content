## Effective strategies for job searching

- Attend networking events and job fairs to meet potential employers.
- Keep an inventory of the people you meet and the companies you apply to.
- Follow up with any promising leads you meet.

## Developing qualities for that employers look for

- Someone they can get along with.
- Positive attitude, respectful, empathic, constructive.
- Open-minded and works well in a diverse team with diverse viewpoints.
- Graceful when a decision does not go their way, able to align for the greater good.
- Good communicator and relationship builder.

- Having a good portfolio.

## Finding work experience

TODO

## Selling yourself to would-be employers

- Create a portfolio.
- Build the perfect resumé.
- Get experience — build real projects and contribute to open source.
- Build your online persona.
- Use sites like [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) to help with the above.

## Preparing yourself for job interviews

- Be aware of the kinds of questions and tests you will come across.
- Practice writing answers for coding and design interview questions.
- Build a collection of anecdotes to use for experience-based interview questions.
