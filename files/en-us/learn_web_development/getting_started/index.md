Welcome to **Getting started**! If you are a complete beginner (i.e., you've not installed a code editor or written any code yet), then this is the place to be. The Getting started modules take you through installing the software you need, familiarity with your development environment, taking your first stab at building a simple website, and understanding some of the essential concepts surrounding web development.

## Prerequisites

There is no prerequisite knowledge for starting this course. Also note that we don't consider learning these topics as required before moving on to the [Core modules](/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core), but we believe students will have an easier time if they spend some time on these topics first.
