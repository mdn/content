<p class="summary">Flash's Clipboard API used to be the only available means for creating advanced clipboard functionality, but this is now available in web standards.</p>

<p>Operating systems all have standard clipboard (i.e. Copy/Paste/Cut) functionality built in, but what if you want to do something a bit more complex, such as having a button that triggers the copying of a certain text selection?</p>

<h2 id="The_basics">The basics</h2>

<p>The <a href="http://help.adobe.com/en_US/FlashPlatform/reference/actionscript/3/flash/desktop/Clipboard.html">Flash Clipboard API</a> provided such functionality, but fortunately modern browsers now have functionality available to do the same things, without having the Flash Player present or having to attach a Flash movie to your page. The relevant APIs are:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection">Selection API</a>: Allows you to programmatically set and modify the text selection on the current document.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/execCommand">execCommand API</a>: Allows you to programmatically execute clipboard-related commands such as Copy and Paste.</li>
</ul>
