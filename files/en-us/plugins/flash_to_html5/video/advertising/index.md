You may also want to incorporate advertising into your video delivery system, via an ad network.

## In a nutshell

You'll need to work with your ad partners to migrate to HTML. Generally speaking, ad formats such as [VAST](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/digital-video-ad-serving-template-vast-4-0/) and [VPAID 2.0](https://www.iab.com/guidelines/digital-video-player-ad-interface-definition-vpaid-2-0/) are supported in HTML5. Many commercial video players support VAST/VPAID, such as [Cedato](https://cedato.com/), [JWPlayer](https://www.jwplayer.com/), and [Video.js](https://videojs.com/).

You need to ensure that your chosen player integrates effectively with your ad partner ([FreeWheel](https://freewheel.tv/), [DoubleClick](https://www.doubleclickbygoogle.com/), etc., can answer questions and provide help with choosing a solution that works for you).

## Useful tools

The [IMA SDK](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/) is useful for building solutions that allow video ads to play (see also the [IMA Get Started guide](https://developers.google.com/interactive-media-ads/docs/sdks/html5/quickstart)).
