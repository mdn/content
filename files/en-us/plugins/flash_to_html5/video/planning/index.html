<p class="summary">Transitioning from Flash to HTML5 can take several months and may require new skills and software. This guide shows you how to plan for that transition.</p>

<h2 id="Auditing_what_you_have">Auditing what you have</h2>

<p>Before you begin, you'll need to identify the media assets and core use cases of your existing Flash functionality. The following questions can help you prepare:</p>

<h3 id="Media_Files">Media Files</h3>

<ul>
 <li>How many media files do you have on the site?</li>
 <li>What format are the media files in? Some formats (e.g. FLV) are not compatible with HTML and the media files will need to be converted.</li>
 <li>Do you have the original media files? If you need to create new files (e.g. MP4) then transcoding from the original will give you higher quality.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Business_Requirements">Business Requirements</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Do you currently support video ads, such as pre-rolls or interstitials? What ad networks do you partner with?</li>
 <li>Do you currently authenticate user access?</li>
 <li>Do you currently use digital rights management (DRM), for example <a href="https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/adobe-access.html">Adobe Access</a>?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Distribution">Distribution</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Do you currently support adaptive streaming (e.g. the <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/hds-dynamic-streaming.html">Adobe HTTP Dynamic Streaming</a> format?)</li>
 <li>Do you use a {{glossary("CDN")}} for distribution?</li>
 <li>Do you provide captions or subtitles for your media? If so, what file formats are those in? What languages do you support?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Decision_points">Decision points</h2>

<p>Once you've audited your Flash experience, there are a few key decisions you'll want to make about your new HTML experience:</p>

<h3 id="User_Requirements">User Requirements</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Will you support the mobile web as well as desktop?</li>
 <li>Will you support offline playback?</li>
 <li>Do you need to support changing network conditions? If so, you will want to use an adaptive streaming format.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Business_Requirements_2">Business Requirements</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Will you authenticate users before allowing them to access your media?</li>
 <li>Will you need video (or audio) ads? Which partners will you use?</li>
 <li>Do you need to protect the media files with DRM?</li>
</ul>
