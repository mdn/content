A CDN is a popular choice for effective delivery of media content.

## CDN requirements

If you are working with a content delivery network (CDN) you will want to ensure that it supports HTTPS for media delivery. This is rapidly becoming a firm requirement within browsers for native media playback.

You'll also want to coordinate with your CDN company to ensure support for your media file format, adaptive streaming formats, digital rights management, and ad network providers.
