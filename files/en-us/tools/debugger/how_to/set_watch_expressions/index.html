<p>When debugging code, sometimes it's useful to watch expressions as executions are paused. The Debugger features a pane for entering expressions to be watched (watch expressions). As you step through code, the debugger will watch the expression and return any results.</p>

<p>To set a watch expression, expand the Watch Expressions sidebar, then click "Add Watch Expression." Type the expression you'd like to watch into the text field.</p>

<p>The debugger will save the expression and watch it as you step through your code. When the debugger reaches a breakpoint, it will display your watch expressions variables:</p>

<p>You can step through your code, watching the value of the expression as it changes. Each time it does, the box will flash briefly yellow. You can remove a watch expression by clicking the "x" icon next to it, and you can have more than one watch expression at a time.</p>
