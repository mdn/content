<p>The debugger shows the source code for all running worker threads — <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API">web workers</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">service workers</a>, etc. — listed in the sources list. You can open the JavaScript file for the worker process and set <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/How_to/Set_a_breakpoint">breakpoints</a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/Set_a_logpoint">logpoints</a> just as you can with JavaScript code running on the main thread.</p>

<h2 id="Inspecting_worker_code">Inspecting worker code</h2>

<p>For example, see the selected item <code>worker.js</code> below — it is listed in a separate thread in the sources list, but appears in the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/UI_Tour#Source_pane">source pane</a> in the same way as main thread code when selected<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/UI_Tour#Source_pane">.</a></p>

<h2 id="Setting_breakpoints_etc.">Setting breakpoints, etc.</h2>

<p>You can set a breakpoint (or logpoint) on any active worker thread:</p>

<p>When execution is paused in a worker thread, the context of the debugger is updated to show the correct breakpoints, call stack, etc., just as you'd expect.</p>
