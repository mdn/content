<p>Determining why CPUs are busy is a routine task for performance analysis, which often involves profiling stack traces. Profiling by sampling at a fixed rate is a coarse but effective way to see which code-paths are hot (busy on-CPU). It usually works by creating a timed interrupt that collects the current program counter, function address, or entire stack back trace, and translates these to something human readable when printing a summary report.</p>

<p>Profiling data can be thousands of lines long, and difficult to comprehend. <em>Flame graphs</em> are a visualization for sampled stack traces, which allows hot code-paths to be identified quickly. See the<a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html">Flame Graphs</a> main page for uses of this visualization other than CPU profiling.</p>

<p>Flame Graphs can work with any CPU profiler on any operating system. My examples here use Linux perf_events, DTrace, SystemTap, and ktap. See the <a href="http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html#Updates">Updates</a> list for other profiler examples, and <a href="https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph">github</a> for the flame graph software.</p>
