<p>You can use the <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools">Firefox developer tools</a> on your desktop to debug Web sites and Web apps running in other browsers or runtimes. The other browser might be on the same device as the tools themselves or on a different device, such as a phone connected over USB.</p>

<p>The detailed instructions for connecting the developer tools are specific to the runtime.</p>

<p>You can connect the developer tools to Gecko-based runtimes like Firefox Desktop, Firefox for Android, and Thunderbird.</p>
