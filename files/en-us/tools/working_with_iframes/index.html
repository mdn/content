<p>You can point the developer tools at a specific <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe"><code>iframe</code></a> within a document. The <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector">Inspector</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console">Console</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger">Debugger</a> and all other developer tools will then target that iframe (essentially behaving as if the rest of the page does not exist).</p>

<p>To set an iframe as the target for the developer tools:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Select the <em>iframe context picker button</em> to launch a popup listing all the iframes in the document (and the main document itself). Note that the button is only displayed if the page includes iframes!
      <p><img alt="Screenshot showing how to set an iframe as the target of developer tools (using the iframe button)" src="developer_tools_select_iframe.png" /></p></li>
  <li>Select an entry to make it the <em>target iframe</em>.</li>
</ul>

<div class="notecard note">
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>The iframe context picker button feature is enabled by default (if it has been disabled the iframe button is never displayed). The feature can be re-enabled from the Settings menu, using the "Select an iframe as the currently targeted document" checkbox.</p>
</div>
