<p>The JSON viewer is new in Firefox 44.</p>

<p>Before Firefox 53, the JSON viewer is enabled by default only in Firefox Developer Edition and Firefox Nightly. To enable this feature in other release channels, set the <code>devtools.jsonview.enabled</code> preference to <code>true</code>.</p>

<p>From Firefox 53 onwards, the JSON viewer is also enabled by default in Beta and the normal release version of Firefox.</p>
</div>

<p>Firefox includes a JSON viewer. If you open a JSON file in the browser, or view a remote URL with the Content-Type set to application/json, it is parsed and given syntax highlighting. Arrays and objects are shown collapsed, and you can expand them using the "+" icons.</p>

<p>The JSON viewer provides a search box that you can use to filter the JSON.</p>

<p>You can also view the raw JSON and pretty-print it.</p>

<p>Finally, if the document was the result of a network request, the viewer displays the request and response headers.</p>
