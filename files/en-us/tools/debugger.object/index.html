<h1 id="Debugger.Object">Debugger.Object</h1>

<p>A <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance represents an object in the debuggee, providing reflection-oriented methods to inspect and modify its referent. The referent's properties do not appear directly as properties of the <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance; the debugger can access them only through methods like <code>Debugger.Object.prototype.getOwnPropertyDescriptor</code> and <code>Debugger.Object.prototype.defineProperty</code>, ensuring that the debugger will not inadvertently invoke the referent's getters and setters.</p>

<p>SpiderMonkey creates exactly one <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance for each debuggee object it presents to a given <a href="Debugger" title="The Debugger object"><code>Debugger</code></a> instance: if the debugger encounters the same object through two different routes (perhaps two functions are called on the same object), SpiderMonkey presents the same <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance to the debugger each time. This means that the debugger can use the <code>==</code> operator to recognize when two <code>Debugger.Object</code> instances refer to the same debuggee object, and place its own properties on a <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance to store metadata about particular debuggee objects.</p>

<p>JavaScript code in different compartments can have different views of the same object. For example, in Firefox, code in privileged compartments sees content DOM element objects without redefinitions or extensions made to that object's properties by content code. (In Firefox terminology, privileged code sees the element through an "xray wrapper".) To ensure that debugger code sees each object just as the debuggee would, each <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance presents its referent as it would be seen from a particular compartment. This "viewing compartment" is chosen to match the way the debugger came across the referent. As a consequence, a single <a href="Debugger" title="The Debugger object"><code>Debugger</code></a> instance may actually have several <code>Debugger.Object</code> instances: one for each compartment from which the referent is viewed.</p>

<p>If more than one <a href="Debugger" title="The Debugger object"><code>Debugger</code></a> instance is debugging the same code, each <a href="Debugger" title="The Debugger object"><code>Debugger</code></a> gets a separate <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance for a given object. This allows the code using each <a href="Debugger" title="The Debugger object"><code>Debugger</code></a> instance to place whatever properties it likes on its own <code>Debugger.Object</code> instances, without worrying about interfering with other debuggers.</p>

<p>While most <code>Debugger.Object</code> instances are created by SpiderMonkey in the process of exposing debuggee's behavior and state to the debugger, the debugger can use <code>Debugger.Object.prototype.makeDebuggeeValue</code> to create <code>Debugger.Object</code> instances for given debuggee objects, or use <code>Debugger.Object.prototype.copy</code> and <code>Debugger.Object.prototype.create</code> to create new objects in debuggee compartments, allocated as if by particular debuggee globals.</p>

<p><code>Debugger.Object</code> instances protect their referents from the garbage collector; as long as the <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance is live, the referent remains live. This means that garbage collection has no visible effect on <code>Debugger.Object</code> instances.</p>

<h2 id="Accessor_Properties_of_the_Debugger.Object_prototype">Accessor Properties of the Debugger.Object prototype</h2>

<p>A <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance inherits the following accessor properties from its prototype:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><code>proto</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>The referent's prototype (as a new <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance), or <code>null</code> if it has no prototype.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>class</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>A string naming the ECMAScript <code>[[Class]]</code> of the referent.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>callable</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p><code>true</code> if the referent is a callable object (such as a function or a function proxy); false otherwise.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>name</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>The name of the referent, if it is a named function. If the referent is an anonymous function, or not a function at all, this is <code>undefined</code>.</p>

 <p>This accessor returns whatever name appeared after the <code>function</code> keyword in the source code, regardless of whether the function is the result of instantiating a function declaration (which binds the function to its name in the enclosing scope) or evaluating a function expression (which binds the function to its name only within the function's body).</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>displayName</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>The referent's display name, if the referent is a function with a display name. If the referent is not a function, or if it has no display name, this is <code>undefined</code>.</p>

 <p>If a function has a given name, its display name is the same as its given name. In this case, the <code>displayName</code> and <code>name</code> properties are equal.</p>

 <p>If a function has no name, SpiderMonkey attempts to infer an appropriate name for it given its context. For example:</p>

 <pre><code>function f() {}          // display name: f (the given name)
var g = function () {};  // display name: g
o.p = function () {};    // display name: o.p
var q = {
  r: function () {}      // display name: q.r
};</code></pre>

 <p>Note that the display name may not be a proper JavaScript identifier, or even a proper expression: we attempt to find helpful names even when the function is not immediately assigned as the value of some variable or property. Thus, we use <code><em>a</em>/<em>b</em></code> to refer to the <em>b</em> defined within <em>a</em>, and <code><em>a</em>&lt;</code> to refer to a function that occurs somewhere within an expression that is assigned to <em>a</em>. For example:</p>

 <pre><code>function h() {
  var i = function() {};    // display name: h/i
  f(function () {});        // display name: h/&lt;
}

var s = f(function () {});  // display name: s&lt;</code></pre>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>parameterNames</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>If the referent is a debuggee function, the names of the its parameters, as an array of strings. If the referent is not a debuggee function, or not a function at all, this is <code>undefined</code>.</p>

 <p>If the referent is a host function for which parameter names are not available, return an array with one element per parameter, each of which is <code>undefined</code>.</p>

 <p>If the referent is a function proxy, return an empty array.</p>

 <p>If the referent uses destructuring parameters, then the array's elements reflect the structure of the parameters. For example, if the referent is a function declared in this way:</p>

 <pre><code>function f(a, [b, c], {d, e:f}) { ... }</code></pre>

 <p>then this <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance's <code>parameterNames</code> property would have the value:</p>

 <pre><code>["a", ["b", "c"], {d:"d", e:"f"}]</code></pre>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>script</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>If the referent is a function that is debuggee code, this is that function's script, as a <a href="Debugger.Script"><code>Debugger.Script</code></a> instance. If the referent is a function proxy or not debuggee code, this is <code>undefined</code>.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>environment</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>If the referent is a function that is debuggee code, a <a href="Debugger.Environment"><code>Debugger.Environment</code></a> instance representing the lexical environment enclosing the function when it was created. If the referent is a function proxy or not debuggee code, this is <code>undefined</code>.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>proxyHandler</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>If the referent is a proxy whose handler object was allocated by debuggee code, this is its handler object—the object whose methods are invoked to implement accesses of the proxy's properties. If the referent is not a proxy whose handler object was allocated by debuggee code, this is <code>null</code>.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>proxyCallTrap</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>If the referent is a function proxy whose handler object was allocated by debuggee code, this is its call trap function—the function called when the function proxy is called. If the referent is not a function proxy whose handler object was allocated by debuggee code, this is <code>null</code>.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>proxyConstructTrap</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>If the referent is a function proxy whose handler object was allocated by debuggee code, its construction trap function—the function called when the function proxy is called via a <code>new</code> expression. If the referent is not a function proxy whose handler object was allocated by debuggee code, this is <code>null</code>.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>global</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>A <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance referring to the global object in whose scope the referent was allocated. This does not unwrap cross-compartment wrappers: if the referent is a wrapper, the result refers to the wrapper's global, not the wrapped object's global. The result refers to the global directly, not via a wrapper.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>hostAnnotations</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>A JavaScript object providing further metadata about the referent, or <code>null</code> if none is available. The metadata object is in the same compartment as this <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance. The same metadata object is returned each time for a given <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance.</p>

 <p>A typical JavaScript embedding provides "host objects" to expose application-specific functionality to scripts. The <code>hostAnnotations</code> accessor consults the embedding for additional information about the referent that might be of interest to the debugger. The returned object's properties' meanings are up to the embedding. For example, a web browser might provide host annotations for global objects to distinguish top-level windows, iframes, and internal JavaScript scopes.</p>

 <p>By convention, host annotation objects have a string-valued <code>"type"</code> property that, taken together with the object's class, indicate what sort of thing the referent is. The host annotation object's other properties provide further details, as appropriate for the type. For example, in Firefox, a metadata object for a JavaScript Module's global object might look like this:</p>

 <pre><code>{ "type":"jsm", "uri":"resource:://gre/modules/XPCOMUtils.jsm" }</code></pre>

 <p>Firefox provides [DebuggerHostAnnotationsForFirefox annotations] for its host objects.</p>

<h2 id="Function_Properties_of_the_Debugger.Object_prototype">Function Properties of the Debugger.Object prototype</h2>

<p>The functions described below may only be called with a <code>this</code> value referring to a <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance; they may not be used as methods of other kinds of objects. The descriptions use "referent" to mean "the referent of this <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance".</p>

<p>Unless otherwise specified, these methods are not <a href="Debugger.Frame#invocation-functions-and-debugger-frames" title="Debugger.Frame: Invocation Frames">invocation functions</a>; if a call would cause debuggee code to run (say, because it gets or sets an accessor property whose handler is debuggee code, or because the referent is a proxy whose traps are debuggee code), the call throws a <a href="Conventions#the-debugger.debuggeewouldrun-exception" title="Debugger API: DebuggeeWouldRun"><code>Debugger.DebuggeeWouldRun</code></a> exception.</p>

<dl>
 <dt><code>getProperty(<em>name</em>)</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Return the value of the referent's property named<em>name</em>, or <code>undefined</code> if it has no such property.<em>Name</em> must be a string. The result is a debuggee value.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>setProperty(<em>name</em>,<em>value</em>)</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Store<em>value</em> as the value of the referent's property named<em>name</em>, creating the property if it does not exist.<em>Name</em> must be a string;<em>value</em> must be a debuggee value.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>getOwnPropertyDescriptor(<em>name</em>)</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Return a property descriptor for the property named<em>name</em> of the referent. If the referent has no such property, return <code>undefined</code>. (This function behaves like the standard <code>Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor</code> function, except that the object being inspected is implicit; the property descriptor returned is allocated as if by code scoped to the debugger's global object (and is thus in the debugger's compartment); and its <code>value</code>, <code>get</code>, and <code>set</code> properties, if present, are debuggee values.)</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>getOwnPropertyNames()</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Return an array of strings naming all the referent's own properties, as if <code>Object.getOwnPropertyNames(<em>referent</em>)</code> had been called in the debuggee, and the result copied in the scope of the debugger's global object.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>defineProperty(<em>name</em>,<em>attributes</em>)</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Define a property on the referent named<em>name</em>, as described by the property descriptor<em>descriptor</em>. Any <code>value</code>, <code>get</code>, and <code>set</code> properties of<em>attributes</em> must be debuggee values. (This function behaves like <code>Object.defineProperty</code>, except that the target object is implicit, and in a different compartment from the function and descriptor.)</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>defineProperties(<em>properties</em>)</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Add the properties given by<em>properties</em> to the referent. (This function behaves like <code>Object.defineProperties</code>, except that the target object is implicit, and in a different compartment from the<em>properties</em> argument.)</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>deleteProperty(<em>name</em>)</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Remove the referent's property named<em>name</em>. Return true if the property was successfully removed, or if the referent has no such property. Return false if the property is non-configurable.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>seal()</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Prevent properties from being added to or deleted from the referent. Return this <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance. (This function behaves like the standard <code>Object.seal</code> function, except that the object to be sealed is implicit and in a different compartment from the caller.)</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>freeze()</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Prevent properties from being added to or deleted from the referent, and mark each property as non-writable. Return this <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance. (This function behaves like the standard <code>Object.freeze</code> function, except that the object to be sealed is implicit and in a different compartment from the caller.)</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>preventExtensions()</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Prevent properties from being added to the referent. (This function behaves like the standard <code>Object.preventExtensions</code> function, except that the object to operate on is implicit and in a different compartment from the caller.)</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>isSealed()</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Return true if the referent is sealed—that is, if it is not extensible, and all its properties have been marked as non-configurable. (This function behaves like the standard <code>Object.isSealed</code> function, except that the object inspected is implicit and in a different compartment from the caller.)</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>isFrozen()</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Return true if the referent is frozen—that is, if it is not extensible, and all its properties have been marked as non-configurable and read-only. (This function behaves like the standard <code>Object.isFrozen</code> function, except that the object inspected is implicit and in a different compartment from the caller.)</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>isExtensible()</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Return true if the referent is extensible—that is, if it can have new properties defined on it. (This function behaves like the standard <code>Object.isExtensible</code> function, except that the object inspected is implicit and in a different compartment from the caller.)</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>copy(<em>value</em>)</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Apply the HTML5 "structured cloning" algorithm to create a copy of<em>value</em> in the referent's global object (and thus in the referent's compartment), and return a <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance referring to the copy.</p>

 <p>Note that this returns primitive values unchanged. This means you can use <code>Debugger.Object.prototype.copy</code> as a generic "debugger value to debuggee value" conversion function—within the limitations of the "structured cloning" algorithm.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>create(<em>prototype</em>, [<em>properties</em>])</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Create a new object in the referent's global (and thus in the referent's compartment), and return a <code>Debugger.Object</code> referring to it. The new object's prototype is<em>prototype</em>, which must be an <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance. The new object's properties are as given by<em>properties</em>, as if<em>properties</em> were passed to <code>Debugger.Object.prototype.defineProperties</code>, with the new <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance as the <code>this</code> value.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>makeDebuggeeValue(<em>value</em>)</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Return the debuggee value that represents<em>value</em> in the debuggee. If<em>value</em> is a primitive, we return it unchanged; if<em>value</em> is an object, we return the <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance representing that object, wrapped appropriately for use in this <code>Debugger.Object</code>'s referent's compartment.</p>

 <p>Note that, if<em>value</em> is an object, it need not be one allocated in a debuggee global, nor even a debuggee compartment; it can be any object the debugger wishes to use as a debuggee value.</p>

 <p>As described above, each <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance presents its referent as viewed from a particular compartment. Given a <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance<em>d</em> and an object<em>o</em>, the call <code><em>d</em>.makeDebuggeeValue(<em>o</em>)</code> returns a <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance that presents<em>o</em> as it would be seen by code in<em>d</em>'s compartment.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>decompile([<em>pretty</em>])</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>If the referent is a function that is debuggee code, return the JavaScript source code for a function definition equivalent to the referent function in its effect and result, as a string. If<em>pretty</em> is present and true, produce indented code with line breaks. If the referent is not a function that is debuggee code, return <code>undefined</code>.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>call(<em>this</em>,<em>argument</em>, ...)</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>If the referent is callable, call it with the given<em>this</em> value and<em>argument</em> values, and return a <a href="Conventions#completion-values" title="Debugger API: General Conventions: Completion Values">completion value</a> describing how the call completed.<em>This</em> should be a debuggee value, or <code>{ asConstructor: true }</code> to invoke the referent as a constructor, in which case SpiderMonkey provides an appropriate <code>this</code> value itself. Each<em>argument</em> must be a debuggee value. All extant handler methods, breakpoints, watchpoints, and so on remain active during the call. If the referent is not callable, throw a <code>TypeError</code>. This function follows the <a href="Debugger.Frame#invocation-functions-and-debugger-frames" title="Debugger.Frame: Invocation Frames">invocation function conventions</a>.</p>

 <p>If the referent is callable, call it with the given<em>this</em> value and the argument values in<em>arguments</em>, and return a <a href="Conventions#completion-values" title="Debugger API: General Conventions: Completion Values">completion value</a> describing how the call completed.<em>This</em> should be a debuggee value, or <code>{ asConstructor: true }</code> to invoke<em>function</em> as a constructor, in which case SpiderMonkey provides an appropriate <code>this</code> value itself.<em>Arguments</em> must either be an array (in the debugger) of debuggee values, or <code>null</code> or <code>undefined</code>, which are treated as an empty array. All extant handler methods, breakpoints, watchpoints, and so on remain active during the call. If the referent is not callable, throw a <code>TypeError</code>. This function follows the <a href="Debugger.Frame#invocation-functions-and-debugger-frames" title="Debugger.Frame: Invocation Frames">invocation function conventions</a>.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>evalInGlobal(<em>code</em>, [<em>options</em>])</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>If the referent is a global object, evaluate<em>code</em> in that global environment, and return a <a href="Conventions#completion-values" title="Debugger API: General Conventions: Completion Values">completion value</a> describing how it completed.<em>Code</em> is a string. All extant handler methods, breakpoints, watchpoints, and so on remain active during the call. This function follows the <a href="Debugger.Frame#invocation-functions-and-debugger-frames" title="Debugger.Frame: Invocation Frames">invocation function conventions</a>. If the referent is not a global object, throw a <code>TypeError</code> exception.</p>

 <p><em>Code</em>is interpreted as strict mode code when it contains a Use Strict Directive.</p>

 <p>If<em>code</em> is not strict mode code, then variable declarations in<em>code</em> affect the referent global object. (In the terms used by the ECMAScript specification, the <code>VariableEnvironment</code> of the execution context for the eval code is the referent.)</p>

 <p>The<em>options</em> argument is as for <a href="Debugger.Frame#eval" title="Debugger.Frame: Eval"><code>Debugger.Frame.prototype.eval</code></a>.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>evalInGlobalWithBindings(<em>code</em>,<em>bindings</em>, [<em>options</em>])</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Like <code>evalInGlobal</code>, but evaluate<em>code</em> using the referent as the variable object, but with a lexical environment extended with bindings from the object<em>bindings</em>. For each own enumerable property of<em>bindings</em> named<em>name</em> whose value is<em>value</em>, include a variable in the lexical environment in which<em>code</em> is evaluated named<em>name</em>, whose value is<em>value</em>. Each<em>value</em> must be a debuggee value. (This is not like a <code>with</code> statement:<em>code</em> may access, assign to, and delete the introduced bindings without having any effect on the<em>bindings</em> object.)</p>

 <p>This method allows debugger code to introduce temporary bindings that are visible to the given debuggee code and which refer to debugger-held debuggee values, and do so without mutating any existing debuggee environment.</p>

 <p>Note that, like <code>evalInGlobal</code>, if the code passed to <code>evalInGlobalWithBindings</code> is not strict mode code, then any declarations it contains affect the referent global object, even as<em>code</em> is evaluated in an environment extended according to<em>bindings</em>. (In the terms used by the ECMAScript specification, the <code>VariableEnvironment</code> of the execution context for non-strict eval code is the referent, and the<em>bindings</em> appear in a new declarative environment, which is the eval code's <code>LexicalEnvironment</code>.)</p>

 <p>The<em>options</em> argument is as for <a href="Debugger.Frame#eval" title="Debugger.Frame: Eval"><code>Debugger.Frame.prototype.eval</code></a>.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>asEnvironment()</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>If the referent is a global object, return the <a href="Debugger.Environment"><code>Debugger.Environment</code></a> instance representing the referent as a variable environment for evaluating code. If the referent is not a global object, throw a <code>TypeError</code>.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>setObjectWatchpoint(<em>handler</em>)</code><em>(future plan)</em></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Set a watchpoint on all the referent's own properties, reporting events by calling<em>handler</em>'s methods. Any previous watchpoint handler on this <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance is replaced. If<em>handler</em> is null, the referent is no longer watched.<em>Handler</em> may have the following methods, called under the given circumstances:</p>

 <dl>
  <dt><code>add(<em>frame</em>,<em>name</em>,<em>descriptor</em>)</code></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>A property named<em>name</em> has been added to the referent.<em>Descriptor</em> is a property descriptor of the sort accepted by <code>Debugger.Object.prototype.defineProperty</code>, giving the newly added property's attributes.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><code>delete(<em>frame</em>,<em>name</em>)</code></dt>

  <p>The property named<em>name</em> is about to be deleted from the referent.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><code>change(<em>frame</em>,<em>name</em>,<em>oldDescriptor</em>,<em>newDescriptor</em>)</code></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>The existing property named<em>name</em> on the referent is being changed from those given by<em>oldDescriptor</em> to those given by<em>newDescriptor</em>. This handler method is only called when attributes of the property other than its value are being changed; if only the value is changing, SpiderMonkey calls the handler's <code>set</code> method.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><code>set(<em>frame</em>,<em>oldValue</em>,<em>newValue</em>)</code></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>The data property named<em>name</em> of the referent is about to have its value changed from<em>oldValue</em> to<em>newValue</em>.</p>

  <p>SpiderMonkey only calls this method on assignments to data properties that will succeed; assignments to un-writable data properties fail without notifying the debugger.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><code>extensionsPrevented(<em>frame</em>)</code></dt>
  <dd>
  <p>The referent has been made non-extensible, as if by a call to <code>Object.preventExtensions</code>.</p>
  </dd>
 </dl>

 <p>For all watchpoint handler methods:</p>

 <ul>
  <li>
   <p>Handler calls receive the handler object itself as the <code>this</code> value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>The<em>frame</em> argument is the current stack frame, whose code is about to perform the operation on the object being reported.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>If the method returns <code>undefined</code>, then SpiderMonkey makes the announced change to the object, and continues execution normally. If the method returns an object:</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>If the object has a <code>superseded</code> property whose value is a true value, then SpiderMonkey does not make the announced change.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>If the object has a <code>resume</code> property, its value is taken as a <a href="Conventions#resumption-values" title="Debugger API: General Conventions: Resumption Values">resumption value</a>, indicating how execution should proceed. (However, <code>return</code> resumption values are not supported.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>If a given method is absent from<em>handler</em>, then events of that sort are ignored. The watchpoint consults<em>handler</em>'s properties each time an event occurs, so adding methods to or removing methods from<em>handler</em> after setting the watchpoint enables or disables reporting of the corresponding events.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>Values passed to<em>handler</em>'s methods are debuggee values. Descriptors passed to<em>handler</em>'s methods are ordinary objects in the debugger's compartment, except for <code>value</code>, <code>get</code>, and <code>set</code> properties in descriptors, which are debuggee values; they are the sort of value expected by <code>Debugger.Object.prototype.defineProperty</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
   <p>Watchpoint handler calls are cross-compartment, intra-thread calls: the call takes place in the same thread that changed the property, and in<em>handler</em>'s method's compartment (typically the same as the debugger's compartment).</p>
  </li>
 </ul>

 <p>The new watchpoint belongs to the <a href="Debugger" title="The Debugger object"><code>Debugger</code></a> instance to which this <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance belongs; disabling the <a href="Debugger" title="The Debugger object"><code>Debugger</code></a> instance disables this watchpoint.</p>

 <dt><code>setPropertyWatchpoint(<em>name</em>,<em>handler</em>)</code><em>(future plan)</em></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Set a watchpoint on the referent's property named<em>name</em>, reporting events by calling<em>handler</em>'s methods. Any previous watchpoint handler on this property for this <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance is replaced. If<em>handler</em> is null, the property is no longer watched.<em>Handler</em> is as described for <code>Debugger.Object.prototype.setObjectWatchpoint</code>, except that it does not receive <code>extensionsPrevented</code> events.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>clearPropertyWatchpoint(<em>name</em>)</code><em>(future plan)</em></dt>

 <dt><code>unwrap()</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>If the referent is a wrapper that this <code>Debugger.Object</code>'s compartment is permitted to unwrap, return a <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance referring to the wrapped object. If we are not permitted to unwrap the referent, return <code>null</code>. If the referent is not a wrapper, return this <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance unchanged.</p>
 </dd>
 <dt><code>unsafeDereference()</code></dt>
 <dd>
 <p>Return the referent of this <code>Debugger.Object</code> instance.</p>

 <p>If the referent is an inner object (say, an HTML5 <code>Window</code> object), return the corresponding outer object (say, the HTML5 <code>WindowProxy</code> object). This makes <code>unsafeDereference</code> more useful in producing values appropriate for direct use by debuggee code, without using <a href="Debugger.Frame#invocation-functions-and-debugger-frames" title="Debugger.Frame: Invocation Frames">invocation functions</a>.</p>

 <p>This method pierces the membrane of <code>Debugger.Object</code> instances meant to protect debugger code from debuggee code, and allows debugger code to access debuggee objects through the standard cross-compartment wrappers, rather than via <code>Debugger.Object</code>'s reflection-oriented interfaces. This method makes it easier to gradually adapt large code bases to this Debugger API: adapted portions of the code can use <code>Debugger.Object</code> instances, but use this method to pass direct object references to code that has not yet been updated.</p>
