 Mozilla is now able to show icons in the message header area and the addressbook card pane.<br>
 <br>
 For the message pane, the icon we will show is on disk at:<br>
 <br>
 &lt;profile home&gt;/NIM/&lt;value of pref aim.session.screenname&gt;/picture/&lt;screenname for sender email address&gt;.gif<br>
 <br>
 When trying to determine the screenname for the sender, we search the addressbook that we are using for collection.  (See <a class="external" href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-org/source/html/mailnews/arch/cab.html">this</a> document for info about that.)<br>
 <br>
 For the addressbook card pane, the icon will show is on disk at:<br>
 <br>
 &lt;profile home&gt;/NIM/&lt;value of pref aim.session.screenname&gt;/picture/&lt;screenname for card&gt;.gif<br>
 <br>
 If aim.session.screenname is not set, the icon will not appear. <br>
 If there is no card matching the email, the icon will not appear. <br>
 If there is a card, but no screenname, the icon will not appear. <br>
 And finally, if there is no icon, the icon will not appear.<br>
 <br>
 The reason this file name scheme was chosen was is this is how Netscape 7.0 IM stores buddy icons on disk. <br>
 So if you use NIM, and you use buddy icons, this will just work for free.<br>
 <br>
 Notes:</p>

<ol>
 <li>You do not have to be online to use this feature.</li>
 <li>We do not show any buddy icon if you are in "collapsed" header mode.</li>
</ol>
