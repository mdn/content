<p>The Account Provisioner is the dialog that first comes up when starting Thunderbird. The Account Provisioner gives the user the chance to search for and order a vanity email account from a list of partner providers. If the user already has an email account, the user can switch to the original account setup wizard.</p>

<h3 id="Debugging">Debugging</h3>

<p>The Account Provisioner dialog logs most if not all of its activities, which is useful for debugging. Logs can either be dumped to the terminal via <code>dump</code>, or to the Error Console.</p>

<p>To have logs dumped to the terminal, create a string preference called <code>mail.provider.logging.dump</code> and set its value to <code>All</code>.</p>

<p>To have logs dumped to the Error Console, create a string preference called <code>mail.provider.logging.console</code> and set its value to <code>All</code>.</p>
