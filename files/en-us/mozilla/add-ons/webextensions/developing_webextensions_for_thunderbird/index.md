You'll approach the coding of an extension for Thunderbird in the same way as you would for a Firefox extension; using a text editor or tool of your choice to write the code.

## API differences

> **Note:** See [ReadTheDocs](https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/latest/) for Thunderbird specific WebExtension API documentation.

Being both Gecko based, Thunderbird supports many of the APIs Firefox supports, with some differences, see [browser compatibility for manifest.json](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Browser_compatibility_for_manifest.json) and [browser support for JavaScript APIs](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Browser_support_for_JavaScript_APIs) for details.
