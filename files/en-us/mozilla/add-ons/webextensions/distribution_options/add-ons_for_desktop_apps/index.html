<p>If you have developed an add-on to complement a desktop application, there are several ways you can install the add-on:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Direct the user to install from <a href="http://addons.mozilla.org" rel="noreferrer">addons.mozilla.org</a> (AMO) by offering a link.</li>
 <li>Sideloading.</li>
 <li>Using the Windows registry.</li>
</ul>

<p>Of these options, directing the user to install from AMO by offering a link is recommended. The reasons for recommending this option are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>It avoids any issues with the installation process; the user will not get an interstitial messages during the installation of the add-on, find the add-on installed but disabled, or find that the add-on was not installed.</li>
 <li>If you update the add-on, the new version will be automatically installed, once you have uploaded it to AMO.</li>
</ul>

<p>By contrast, sideloading using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Alternative_methods_of_installing_add-ons/Sideloading_add-ons#Installation_using_the_standard_extension_folders">standard extension folders</a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Alternative_methods_of_installing_add-ons/Installing_add-ons_in_an_enterprise_environment#Installation_using_the_Windows_registry">Windows registry</a> will require your desktop app to install any update to the add-on. Also, based on the default Firefox settings, the installation process will present the user with warnings (an interstitial message) or silently install the add-on but disable it. The worst case is that the installation will fail silently if Firefox is setup to <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Alternative_methods_of_installing_add-ons/Installing_add-ons_in_an_enterprise_environment#Controlling_automatic_installation">disable automatic installation</a>. You can update the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Alternative_methods_of_installing_add-ons/Installing_add-ons_in_an_enterprise_environment#Settings_scope_preferences_programmatically">Firefox configuration</a> to avoid these issues, but that is not recommended.</p>
