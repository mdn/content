> **Note:** If you are already familiar with the basic concepts of browser extensions, skip this section to [see how extension files are put together](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Anatomy_of_a_WebExtension). Then, use the [reference documentation](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions#reference) to start building your extension. Visit [Firefox Extension Workshop](https://extensionworkshop.com/?utm_source=developer.mozilla.org&utm_medium=documentation&utm_campaign=your-first-extension) to learn more about the workflow for testing, publishing, and extensions for Firefox.

An extension adds features and functions to a browser. It’s created using familiar web-based technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can take advantage of the same web APIs as JavaScript on a web page, but an extension also has access to its own set of JavaScript APIs. This means that you can do a lot more in an extension than you can with code in a web page. Here are just a few examples of the things you can do:

**Enhance or complement a website**: Use an add-on to deliver additional in-browser features or information from your website. Allow users to collect details from pages they visit to enhance the service you offer.

Examples: [Amazon Assistant for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amazon-browser-bar/), [OneNote Web Clipper](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onenote-clipper/), and [Grammarly for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/grammarly-1/)

**Let users show their personality**: Browser extensions can manipulate the content of web pages; for example, letting users add their favorite logo or picture as a background to every page they visit. Extensions may also enable users to update the look of the Firefox UI, the same way standalone [theme add-ons](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Themes/Theme_concepts) do.

![](myweb_new_tab_add_on.png)

Examples: [MyWeb New Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/myweb-new-tab/), [Tabliss](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabliss/), and [VivaldiFox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vivaldifox/)

**Add or remove content from web pages**: You might want to help users block intrusive ads from web pages, provide access to a travel guide whenever a country or city is mentioned in a web page, or reformat page content to offer a consistent reading experience. With the ability to access and update both a page’s HTML and CSS, extensions can help users see the web the way they want to.

![](ublock_origin_add_on.png)

Examples: [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/), [Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reader/), and [Toolbox for Google Play Store™](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/toolbox-google-play-store/)

**Add tools and new browsing features**: Add new features to a taskboard, or generate QR code images from URLs, hyperlinks, or page text. With flexible UI options and the power of the [WebExtensions APIs](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions) you can easily add new features to a browser. And, you can enhance almost any website’s features or functionality, it doesn't have to be your website.

![](qr_code_image_generator_add_on.png)

Examples: [Swimlanes for Trello](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/swimlanes-for-trello/) and [Tomato Clock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tomato-clock/)

**Games**: Offer traditional computer games with off-line play features, or explore new game possibilities; for example, by incorporating gameplay into everyday browsing.

![](asteroids_in_popup_add_on_.png)

Examples: [Asteroids in Popup](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/asteroids-in-popup/), [Solitaire Card Game New Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/solitaire-card-game-new-tab/), and [2048 Prime](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/2048-prime/).

**Add development tools**: You may provide web development tools as your business or have developed a useful technique or approach to web development that you want to share. Either way, you can enhance the built-in Firefox developer tools by adding a new tab to the developer toolbar.

![](axe_developer_tools_add_on.png)

Examples: [Web Developer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-developer/), [Web React Developer Tools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/), and [aXe Developer Tools](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/axe-devtools/)

Extensions for Firefox are built using the [WebExtensions APIs](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions), a cross-browser system for developing extensions. To a large extent, the API is compatible with the [extension API](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions) supported by Google Chrome and Opera. Extensions written for these browsers will in most cases run in Firefox or Microsoft Edge with just a few [changes](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/porting-a-google-chrome-extension/). The API is also fully compatible with [multiprocess Firefox](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Multiprocess_Firefox).

If you have ideas or questions, or need help [migrating a legacy add-on to WebExtensions APIs](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/porting-a-legacy-firefox-extension), you can reach us on the [dev-addons mailing list](https://mail.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-addons) or in the [Add-ons room](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#addons:mozilla.org) on [Matrix](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Matrix).
