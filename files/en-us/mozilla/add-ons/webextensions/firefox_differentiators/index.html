<p>Firefox is a great place to begin your browser extension development. To start, you get the highest compliance with the proposed browser extension API including use of the <code>browser.*</code> namespace and promises for handling asynchronous events. Then, there is a highly supportive community of extension developers, ready to assist you.</p>

<p>Firefox also offers some unique features that you can use to build more secure, easy to use, and more visually appealing extensions. Just take a look at what’s available:</p>

  <tr>
   <td>
    <p>Help users separate their browser activities with <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/contextualIdentities">Contextual Identities</a> a.k.a. Containers. Give groups of tabs their own local browser storage: cookie store and local data in localStorage and indexedDB. This keeps details such as site preferences, signed in sessions, and ad tracking data private to the tabs.</p>

    <p>Better integrate your extension with the browser using the ability to pick up the browser style in page and browser actions as well as the sidebar UI. Define, in the <code>manifest.json</code> file, the URLs where a page action is shown or hidden, and choose where to place the browser action icon.</p>
