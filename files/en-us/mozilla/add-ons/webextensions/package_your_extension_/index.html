<p>Packaged extensions in Firefox are called "XPI files", which are ZIP files with a different extension.</p>

<p>You don't have to use the XPI extension when uploading to AMO.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="seoSummary">During development, your extension will consist of a directory containing a manifest.json file and the other files the extension needs—scripts, icons, HTML documents, and so on. You need to zip these into a single file for uploading to AMO.</span></p>

<p>The most convenient way to package your extension is to use <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/web-ext_command_reference#web-ext_build">web-ext build</a>. This tool automatically excludes files that are commonly unwanted in packages, such as <code>.git</code> files. Otherwise, follow the instructions below for your operating system.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Tip</strong>. The ZIP file must be a ZIP of the extension's files themselves, not of the directory containing them.</p>
</div>

 <li>Open the shortcut menu and click <strong>Send to</strong> then <strong>Compressed (zipped) folder</strong>.</li>
