{{AddonSidebar()}}

Fired when a network request has finished and its details are available to the extension.

The request is given as a [HAR entry object](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#entries), which is also given an asynchronous `getContent()` method that gets the response body content.

Note that although your extension can add a listener at any time, it will only start firing after the user has activated the browser's [network panel](/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor) at least once.

## Syntax

```js
browser.devtools.network.onRequestFinished.addListener(listener)
browser.devtools.network.onRequestFinished.removeListener(listener)
browser.devtools.network.onRequestFinished.hasListener(listener)
```

Events have three functions:

- `addListener(listener)`
  - : Adds a listener to this event.
- `removeListener(listener)`
  - : Stop listening to this event. The `listener` argument is the listener to remove.
- `hasListener(listener)`
  - : Check whether `listener` is registered for this event. Returns `true` if it is listening, `false` otherwise.

## addListener syntax

### Parameters

- `callback`

  - : Function that will be called when this event occurs. The function will be passed the following arguments:

    - `request`
      - : `object`. An object representing the request. This object is a single [HAR entry](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#entries) object. It also defines an asynchronous `getContent()` method, which returns a [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that resolves with an array of two elements. The first element is the HTTP response body as a string, while the second element is the [MIME type](/en-US/docs/Glossary/MIME_type) of the HTTP response also as a string.

## Examples

Add a listener that logs the server IP address and response body for every network request.

```js
function handleRequestFinished(request) {
  console.log("Server IP: ", request.serverIPAddress);
  request.getContent().then(([content, mimeType]) => {
    console.log("Content: ", content);
Â    console.log("MIME type: ", mimeType);
  });
}

browser.devtools.network.onRequestFinished.addListener(handleRequestFinished);
```
