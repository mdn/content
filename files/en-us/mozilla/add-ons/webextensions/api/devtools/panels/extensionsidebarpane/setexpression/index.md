{{AddonSidebar()}}

Evaluates an expression in the context of the inspected page, and displays the result in the extension sidebar pane.

The expression's execution context is the same as that for [`inspectedWindow.eval()`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/devtools/inspectedWindow/eval).

JSON objects and DOM nodes are displayed as an expandable tree, as in the [JSON viewer](/en-US/docs/Tools/JSON_viewer) in Firefox. You can optionally specify a `rootTitle` string: this will be displayed as the title of the tree's root.

This is an asynchronous function that returns a [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

## Syntax

```js
var evaluating = browser.devtools.panels.setExpression(
  expression,       // string
  rootTitle         // string
)
```

### Parameters

- `expression`
  - : `string`. The expression to evaluate.
- `rootTitle` {{optional_inline}}
  - : string. The title of the root of the tree in which results are displayed.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that will be fulfilled with no arguments, once the expression has been evaluated.

## Browser compatibility

{{Compat}}

## Examples

This code creates a sidebar pane that displays the [`tagName`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/tagName) of the currently selected element:

```js
function onCreated(sidebarPane) {

  browser.devtools.panels.elements.onSelectionChanged.addListener(() => {
    const exp = "$0Â && $0.tagName";
    const title = "Selected Element tagName";
    sidebarPane.setExpression(exp, title);
  });

}

browser.devtools.panels.elements.createSidebarPane("My pane").then(onCreated);
```
