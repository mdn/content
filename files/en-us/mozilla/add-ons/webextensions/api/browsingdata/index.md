{{AddonSidebar}}

Enables extensions to clear the data that is accumulated while the user is browsing.

In the `browsingData` API, browsing data is divided into types:

- browser cache
- cookies
- downloads
- history
- local storage
- plugin data
- saved form data
- saved passwords

You can use the {{WebExtAPIRef("browsingData.remove()")}} function to remove any combination of these types. There are also dedicated functions to remove each particular type of data, such as {{WebExtAPIRef("browsingData.removePasswords()", "removePasswords()")}}, {{WebExtAPIRef("browsingData.removeHistory()", "removeHistory()")}} and so on.

All the `browsingData.remove[X]()` functions take a {{WebExtAPIRef("browsingData.RemovalOptions")}} object, which you can use to control two further aspects of data removal:

- how far back in time to remove data
- whether to remove data only from normal web pages, or also from hosted web apps and add-ons. Note that this option is not yet supported in Firefox.

Finally, this API gives you aÂ {{WebExtAPIRef("browsingData.settings()")}} function that gives you the current value of the settings for the browser's built-in "Clear History" feature.

To use this API you must have the "browsingData" [API permission](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#api_permissions).
