{{AddonSidebar()}}

Clears the record of web pages that the user has visited (browsing history).

You can use the `removalOptions` parameter, which is aÂ {{WebExtAPIRef("browsingData.RemovalOptions")}} object, to:

- clear only records of web pages visited after a given time
- control whether to clear only records of normal web pages or to clear records of hosted apps and extensions as well.

This is an asynchronous function that returns a [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

## Syntax

```js
var removing = browser.browsingData.removeHistory(
  removalOptions            // RemovalOptions object
)
```

### Parameters

- `removalOptions`
  - : `object`. A {{WebExtAPIRef("browsingData.RemovalOptions")}} object, which may be used to clear only records of web pages visited after a given time, and whether to clear only records of normal web pages or to clear records of hosted apps and extensions as well.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that will be fulfilled with no arguments when the removal has finished. If any error occurs, the promise will be rejected with an error message.

## Examples

Remove records of pages visited in the last week:

```js
function onRemoved() {
  console.log("removed");
}

function onError(error) {
  console.error(error);
}

function weekInMilliseconds() {
  return 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7;
}

var oneWeekAgo = (new Date()).getTime() - weekInMilliseconds();

browser.browsingData.removeHistory(
  {since: oneWeekAgo}).
then(onRemoved, onError);
```

Remove all records of visited pages:

```js
function onRemoved() {
  console.log("removed");
}

function onError(error) {
  console.error(error);
}

browser.browsingData.removeHistory({}).
then(onRemoved, onError);
```
