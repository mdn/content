Clears any [local storage](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) created by websites.

You can use the `removalOptions` parameter, which is aÂ {{WebExtAPIRef("browsingData.RemovalOptions")}} object, to:

- clear only local storage objects created after a given time
- control whether to clear only local storage objects created by normal web pages or to clear objects created by hosted apps and extensions as well.

This is an asynchronous function that returns a [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

## Syntax

```js
var removing = browser.browsingData.removeLocalStorage(
  removalOptions            // RemovalOptions object
)
```

### Parameters

- `removalOptions`
  - : `object`. A {{WebExtAPIRef("browsingData.RemovalOptions")}} object, which may be used to clear only local storage objects created by normal web pages or to clear objects created by hosted apps and extensions as well.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that will be fulfilled with no arguments when the removal has finished. If any error occurs, the promise will be rejected with an error message.
