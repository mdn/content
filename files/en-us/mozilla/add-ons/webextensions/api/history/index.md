Use the `history` API to interact with the browser history.

If you are looking for information about the browser session history, see the [History interface](/en-US/docs/Web/API/History).

> **Note:** Downloads are treated as [`HistoryItem`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/history/HistoryItem "A HistoryItem object provides information about a page in the browser history.") objects. Therefore, events such as [`history.onVisited`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/history/onVisited "Fired each time the user visits a page. A history.HistoryItem object is passed to the listener. This event fires before the page has loaded.") fire for downloads.

Browser history is a chronological record of pages the user has visited. The history API enables you to:

- [search for pages that appear in the browser history](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/history/search)
- [remove individual pages from the browser history](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/history/deleteUrl)
- [add pages to the browser history](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/history/addUrl)
- [remove all pages from the browser history](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/history/deleteAll).

However, the user may have visited a single page multiple times, so the API also has the concept of "visits". So you can also use this API to:

- [retrieve the complete set of visits the user made to a particular page](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/history/getVisits)
- [remove visits to any pages made during a given time period](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/history/deleteRange).

To use this API, an extension must request the "history" [permission](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions) in its [`manifest.json`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json) file.
