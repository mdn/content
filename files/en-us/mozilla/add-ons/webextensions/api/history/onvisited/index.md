{{AddonSidebar()}}

Fired each time the user visits a page. A {{WebExtAPIRef("history.HistoryItem")}} object is passed to the listener. This event fires before the page has loaded.

## Syntax

```js
browser.history.onVisited.addListener(listener)
browser.history.onVisited.removeListener(listener)
browser.history.onVisited.hasListener(listener)
```

Events have three functions:

- `addListener(callback)`
  - : Adds a listener to this event.
- `removeListener(listener)`
  - : Stop listening to this event. The `listener` argument is the listener to remove.
- `hasListener(listener)`
  - : Check whether `listener` is registered for this event. Returns `true` if it is listening, `false` otherwise.

## addListener syntax

### Parameters

- `callback`

  - : Function that will be called when this event occurs. The function will be passed the following arguments:

    - `result`

      - : {{WebExtAPIRef('history.HistoryItem')}}. An object representing the item in the browser's history.

        At the time that this event is sent, the browser doesn't yet know the title of the page. If the browser has visited this page before and has remembered its old title, then the `HistoryItem.title` object will contain the old title of the page. If the browser doesn't have a record of the page's old title, thenÂ `HistoryItem.title` will be empty. To get the titles of pages as soon as they are known, listen for {{WebExtAPIRef("history.onTitleChanged")}}.

## Examples

Listen for visits, and log the URL and visit time.

```js
function onVisited(historyItem) {
  console.log(historyItem.url);
  console.log(new Date(historyItem.lastVisitTime));
}

browser.history.onVisited.addListener(onVisited);
```
