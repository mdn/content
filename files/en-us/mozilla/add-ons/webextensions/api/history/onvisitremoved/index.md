{{AddonSidebar()}}

Fired when a page is removed completely from the browser history.

- If all visits to a single page are removed (for example, using {{WebExtAPIRef("history.deleteUrl")}}), then this event is fired once.
- If a range of visits is removed (for example, using {{WebExtAPIRef("history.deleteRange")}} or a browser feature like "Clear Recent History"), then it is fired once for each page _whose visits all fall within the cleared range_.
- If the browser's entire history is cleared (for example, using {{WebExtAPIRef("history.deleteAll")}}), then it is fired only once.

## Syntax

```js
browser.history.onVisitRemoved.addListener(listener)
browser.history.onVisitRemoved.removeListener(listener)
browser.history.onVisitRemoved.hasListener(listener)
```

Events have three functions:

- `addListener(callback)`
  - : Adds a listener to this event.
- `removeListener(listener)`
  - : Stop listening to this event. The `listener` argument is the listener to remove.
- `hasListener(listener)`
  - : Check whether `listener` is registered for this event. Returns `true` if it is listening, `false` otherwise.

## addListener syntax

### Parameters

- `callback`

  - : Function that will be called when this event occurs. The function will be passed the following argument:

    - `removed`

      - : `object`. Details of the removal. This is an object containing two properties: a boolean `allHistory` and an array `urls`.

        - If this event is firing because all history was cleared, `allHistory` will be `true` and `urls` will be an empty array.
        - Otherwise,Â  `allHistory` will be `false` and `urls` will contain one item, which is the URL of the removed page.

  }
}

browser.history.onVisitRemoved.addListener(onRemoved);
```
