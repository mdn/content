<p>This describes how the browser navigated to a particular page. For example, "link" means that the browser navigated to the page because the user clicked a link.</p>

<h2 id="Type">Type</h2>

<p>Values of this type are strings. Possible values are:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>"link"</dt>
 <dd>The user clicked a link in another page.</dd>
 <dt>"typed"</dt>
 <dd>The user typed the URL into the address bar. This is also used if the user started typing into the address bar, then selected a URL from the suggestions it offered. See also "generated".</dd>
 <dt>"auto_bookmark"</dt>
 <dd>The user clicked a bookmark or an item in the browser history.</dd>
 <dt>"auto_subframe"</dt>
 <dd>Any nested iframes that are automatically loaded by their parent.</dd>
 <dt>"manual_subframe"</dt>
 <dd>Any nested iframes that are loaded as an explicit user action. Loading such an iframe will generate an entry in the back/forward navigation list.</dd>
 <dt>"generated"</dt>
 <dd>The user started typing in the address bar, then clicked on a suggested entry that didn't contain a URL.</dd>
 <dt>"auto_toplevel"</dt>
 <dd>The page was passed to the command line or is the start page.</dd>
 <dt>"form_submit"</dt>
 <dd>The user submitted a form. Note that in some situations, such as when a form uses a script to submit its contents, submitting a form does not result in this transition type.</dd>
 <dt>"reload"</dt>
 <dd>The user reloaded the page, using the Reload button or by pressing Enter in the address bar. This is also used for session restore and reopening closed tabs.</dd>
 <dt>"keyword"</dt>
 <dd>The URL was generated using a <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-search-from-address-bar">keyword search</a> configured by the user.</dd>
 <dt>"keyword_generated"</dt>
 <dd>Corresponds to a visit generated for a keyword.</dd>
