{{AddonSidebar()}}

The `BrowserSetting.onChange` event is fired when the setting is changed.

On Firefox, it doesnâ€™t fire if the change has been made through `about:config`.

## Syntax

```js
BrowserSetting.onChange.addListener(listener)
BrowserSetting.onChange.removeListener(listener)
BrowserSetting.onChange.hasListener(listener)
```

Events have three functions:

- `addListener(listener)`
  - : Adds a listener to this event.
- `removeListener(listener)`
  - : Stop listening to this event. The `listener` argument is the listener to remove.
- `hasListener(listener)`
  - : Check whether `listener` is registered for this event. Returns `true` if it is listening, `false` otherwise.

## addListener syntax

### Parameters

- `callback`

  - : A callback function that will be called when this event occurs. The function will be passed the following arguments:

    - `details`

      - : An `object` containing details of the change that occurred. Its properties are as follows:

        - `value`
          - : The new value of the setting. The type of this property is determined by the particular setting.
        - `levelOfControl`
          - : `string`. This represents the way the setting is currently controlled. You can use it to check whether you can modify the setting. See [`BrowserSetting.set()`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/types/BrowserSetting/set) for details. Its value may be any of the following:<table class="fullwidth-table standard-table">
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td><code>"not_controllable"</code></td>
                  <td>Extensions are not allowed to modify this setting.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><code>"controlled_by_other_extensions"</code></td>
                  <td>
                    Another extension that was installed after this one has modified this
                    setting.
                  </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><code>"controllable_by_this_extension"</code></td>
                  <td>This extension is allowed to modify the setting.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td><code>controlled_by_this_extension"</code></td>
                  <td>This extension has already modified the setting.</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
