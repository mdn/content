<p>Use <code>BrowserSetting.clear()</code> to clear any changes the extension has made to the browser setting. The browser setting will revert to its previous value.</p>

<p>The extension will also give up control of the setting, allowing an extension with lower precedence (that is, an extension that was installed before this one) to modify the setting. See <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/types/BrowserSetting/set">BrowserSetting.set()</a></code> to learn more about controlling settings.</p>

<p>This is an asynchronous function that returns a <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">Promise</a></code>. If clearing the value failed, the promise resolves to <code>false</code>. If clearing the value succeeded it resolves to <code>true</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush:js">var clearing = setting.clear(
  details     // object
)
</pre>

<h3 id="Parameters">Parameters</h3>

 <dt><code>details</code></dt>
 <dd>An empty object.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Return_value">Return value</h3>

<p>A <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">Promise</a></code> that will be fulfilled with a <code>boolean</code>: <code>true</code> if the setting was cleared, <code>false</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>See {{WebExtAPIRef("types.BrowserSetting")}}.</p>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<pre class="brush: js">function onCleared(result) {
  if (result) {
    console.log("Setting was cleared");
  } else {
    console.log("Setting was not cleared");
  }
}

var clearing = browser.privacy.network.webRTCIPHandlingPolicy.clear({});
clearing.then(onCleared);</pre>
