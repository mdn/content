{{AddonSidebar()}}

The **`get()`** method of the {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies")}} API retrieves information about a single cookie, given its name and URL.

If more than one cookie with the same name exists for a given URL, the one with the longest path will be returned. For cookies with the same path length, the cookie with the earliest creation time will be returned. If no matching cookie could be found, `null` is returned.

This is an asynchronous function that returns a [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

## Syntax

```js
var getting = browser.cookies.get(
  details                // object
)
```

### Parameters

- `details`

  - : An `object` containing details that can be used to match a cookie to be retrieved. It can include the following properties:

    - `firstPartyDomain`{{optional_inline}}
      - : A `string` representing the first-party domain with which the cookie to retrieve is associated. This property must be supplied if the browser has first-party isolation enabled. See [First-party isolation](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/cookies#first-party_isolation).
    - `name`
      - : A `string` representing the name of the cookie to retrieve.
    - `partitionKey`{{optional_inline}}

      - : An `object` representing the [storage partition](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/cookies#Storage_partitioning) containing the cookie. Include this object with `topLevelSite` to obtain a cookie from partitioned storage. Otherwise, returns the cookie from unpartitioned storage. This object contains:

        - `topLevelSite`{{optional_inline}}
          - : A `string` representing the first-party URL of the top-level site storage partition containing the cookie.

    - `storeId`{{optional_inline}}
      - : A `string` representing the ID of the {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies.CookieStore", "cookie store")}} in which to look for the cookie (as returned by {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies.getAllCookieStores()")}}). By default, the current execution context's cookie store will be used.
    - `url`
      - : A `string` representing the URL with which the cookie to retrieve is associated. This argument may be a full URL, in which case any data following the URL path (e.g. the query string) is ignored. If [host permissions](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions) for this URL are not specified in the extension's [manifest file](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json), the API call will fail.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that will be fulfilled with aÂ {{WebExtAPIRef('cookies.Cookie', 'Cookie')}} object containing details about the cookie, or `null` if the cookie was not found.

## Examples

This example tries to get the cookie named "favorite-color", associated with the URL for the currently active tab:

```js
function logCookie(cookie) {
  if (cookie) {
    console.log(cookie.value);
  }
}

function getCookie(tabs) {
  var getting = browser.cookies.get({
    url: tabs[0].url,
    name: "favorite-color"
  });
  getting.then(logCookie);
}

var getActive = browser.tabs.query({
  active: true,
  currentWindow: true
});
getActive.then(getCookie);
```
