{{AddonSidebar()}}

The `onChanged` event of the {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies")}} API fires when a cookie that the extension can access is set or removed.

> **Note:** When [storage partitioning](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/cookies#Storage_partitioning) is active, `cookies.Cookie.partitionKey` contains the description of the cookie's storage partition. When modifying cookies, it's important to pass this value to {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies.set()")}} or {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies.remove()")}} to ensure the extension works with the correct cookie.

Note that updating a cookie's properties is implemented as a two step process:

1.  First, the cookie to be updated is first removed entirely, generating a notification with a {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies.OnChangedCause")}} of `overwrite`.
2.  Next, a new cookie is written with the updated values, generating a second notification with a {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies.OnChangedCause")}} of `explicit`.

## Syntax

```js
browser.cookies.onChanged.addListener(listener)
browser.cookies.onChanged.removeListener(listener)
browser.cookies.onChanged.hasListener(listener)
```

This API is also available as `browser.cookies.onChanged.*`.

Events have three functions:

- `addListener(callback)`
  - : Adds a listener to this event.
- `removeListener(listener)`
  - : Stop listening to this event. The `listener` argument is the listener to remove.
- `hasListener(listener)`
  - : Check whether `listener` is registered for this event. Returns `true` if it is listening, `false` otherwise.

## addListener syntax

### Parameters

- `callback`

  - : A callback function that will be called when this event occurs. The function will be passed the following arguments:

    - `changeInfo`

      - : An `object` containing details of the change that occurred. Its properties are as follows:

        - `removed`
          - : A `boolean` that is set to `true` if a cookie was removed, and false if not.
        - `cookie`
          - : A {{WebExtAPIRef('cookies.Cookie')}} object  containing information about the cookie that was set or removed.
        - `cause`
          - : A {{WebExtAPIRef('cookies.OnChangedCause')}} value representing the underlying reason behind the cookie's change.

## Browser compatibility

## Examples

This example listens for `onChanged` events and logs details from the `changeInfo` argument:

```js
browser.cookies.onChanged.addListener(function(changeInfo) {
  console.log('Cookie changed: ' +
              '\n * Cookie: ' + JSON.stringify(changeInfo.cookie) +
              '\n * Cause: ' + changeInfo.cause +
              '\n * Removed: ' + changeInfo.removed);
});
```
