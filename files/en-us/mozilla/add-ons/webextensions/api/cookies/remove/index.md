{{AddonSidebar()}}

The **`remove()`** method of the {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies")}} API deletes a cookie, given its name and URL.

The call succeeds only if you include the "cookies" [API permission](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#api_permissions) in your [manifest.json](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json) file, as well as [host permissions](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#host_permissions) for the given URL specified in its manifest.

This is an asynchronous function that returns a [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

## Syntax

```js
var removing = browser.cookies.remove(
  details               // object
)
```

### Parameters

- `details`

  - : An `object` containing information to identify the cookie to remove. It contains the following properties:

    - `firstPartyDomain`{{optional_inline}}
      - : A `string` representing the first-party domain with which the cookie to remove is associated. This property must be supplied if the browser has first-party isolation enabled. See [First-party isolation](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/cookies#first-party_isolation).
    - `name`
      - : A `string` representing the name of the cookie to remove.
    - `partitionKey`{{optional_inline}}

      - : An `object` representing the [storage partition](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/cookies#Storage_partitioning) containing the cookie. Include this object to remove a cookie from partitioned storage. This object contains:

        - `topLevelSite`{{optional_inline}}
          - : A `string` representing the first-party URL of the top-level site storage partition containing the cookie.

    - `storeId`{{optional_inline}}
      - : A `string` representing the ID of the cookie store to find the cookie in. If unspecified, the cookie is looked for by default in the current execution context's cookie store.
    - `url`
      - : A `string` representing the URL associated with the cookie. If the extension does not have [host permissions](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#host_permissions) for this URL, the API call will fail.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that will be fulfilled with a {{WebExtAPIRef('cookies.Cookie')}} object containing details about the cookie that's been removed. If a cookie matching the `details` parameter could not be found, the promise is fulfilled with `null`.Â  If the call fails for any reason, the promise will be rejected with an error message.

## Browser compatibility

{{Compat}}

## Examples

This example tries to remove the cookie named "favorite-color", whose URL matches the URL of the document hosted by the currently active tab:

```js
function onRemoved(cookie) {
  console.log(`Removed: ${cookie}`);
}

function onError(error) {
  console.log(`Error removing cookie: ${error}`);
}

function removeCookie(tabs) {
  var removing = browser.cookies.remove({
    url: tabs[0].url,
    name: "favorite-color"
  });
  removing.then(onRemoved, onError);
}

var getActive = browser.tabs.query({active: true, currentWindow: true});
getActive.then(removeCookie);
```
