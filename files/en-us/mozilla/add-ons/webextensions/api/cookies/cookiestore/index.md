{{AddonSidebar()}}

The `CookieStore` type of the {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies")}} API represents a cookie store in the browser.

Windows in different browsing modes may use different cookie stores — a private browsing/incognito mode window, for instance, will use a separate cookie store from a non-incognito/private window.

## Type

Values of this type are objects, which can contain the following properties:

- `id`
  - : A `string` representing the unique identifier for the cookie store.
- `incognito`
  - : A boolean value that indicates whether this is an incognito cookie store.
- `tabIds`
  - : An `array` of `integers`, which identifies all of the browser tabs that share this cookie store.

## Browser compatibility

## Examples

In the following snippet, the {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies.getAllCookieStores()")}} method is used to retrieve all the cookie stores currently available in the browser, and print out each cookie store ID, and the tabs that currently share each cookie store.

```js
function logStores(cookieStores) {
  for(store of cookieStores) {
    console.log(`Cookie store: ${store.id}\n Tab IDs: ${store.tabIds}`);
  }
}

var getting = browser.cookies.getAllCookieStores();
getting.then(logStores);
```

The following code snippet gets all cookie stores and then logs the total number of stores and how many of those stores are incognito.

```js
browser.cookies.getAllCookieStores().then((stores) => {
  var incognitoStores = stores.map(store => store.incognito);
  console.log(`Of ${stores.length} cookie stores, ${incognitoStores.length} are incognito.`);
});
```
