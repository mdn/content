<p>The <code>Session</code> object represents a tab or window that the user has closed in the current browsing session.</p>

<p>Sessions are represented as {{WebExtAPIRef("tabs.Tab", "Tab")}} objects if the tab was closed but its window was not closed: for example, because the user clicked the "Close tab" button, and this tab was not the only tab in its window.</p>

<p>Sessions are represented as {{WebExtAPIRef("windows.Window", "Window")}} objects if the window was closed: for example, because the user clicked the "Close window" button, or closed the only tab open in a window.</p>

<p>Note that different browsers might have a different idea of when a session is a Tab and when it is a Window. For example:</p>

<ul>
 <li>In Chrome a session is recorded as a Window if the user closes a window that contained more than one tab. If the user closed a window that contained only one tab, this is recorded as a Tab.</li>
 <li>In Firefox, a session is recorded as a Window if the user closes a window (or a tab that was the last tab in the window), and a Tab if the user closes a tab that wasn't the last tab in its window.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Tab object for a tab that is open will not have a <code>sessionId</code>. When the tab is closed, it will have a <code>sessionId</code> but will not have a tab <code>id</code>. If the tab is restored, it will get a new tab <code>id</code> and will lose the <code>sessionId</code>.</p>

<h2 id="Type">Type</h2>

<p>Values of this type are objects. They contain the following properties:</p>

<dl class="reference-values">
 <dt><code>lastModified</code></dt>
 <dd><code>number</code>. The time the tab or window was closed, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time">milliseconds since the epoch</a>.</dd>
 <dt><code>tab</code>{{optional_inline}}</dt>
 <dd><code>object</code>. If the object represents a closed tab, then this property is present and will be a {{WebExtAPIRef("tabs.Tab")}} object. This will contain <code>url</code>, <code>title</code>, and <code>favIconUrl</code> only if the extension has the "tabs" <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions">permission</a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#host_permissions">host permissions</a> to access the tab's URL.</dd>
 <dt><code>window</code>{{optional_inline}}</dt>
 <dd><code>object</code>. If the object represents a closed window, then this property is present and will be a {{WebExtAPIRef("windows.Window")}} object.</dd>
</dl>
