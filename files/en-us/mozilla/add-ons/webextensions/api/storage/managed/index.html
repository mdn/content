<p>A {{WebExtAPIRef("storage.StorageArea")}} object that represents the <code>managed</code> storage area. Items in <code>managed</code> storage are set by the domain administrator or other native applications installed on user's computer, and are read-only for the extension. Trying to modify this storage area results in an error.</p>

<h2 id="Provisioning_managed_storage">Provisioning managed storage</h2>

<p>The procedure for provisioning managed storage is different for different browsers. For Chrome instructions, see the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/manifest/storage">"Manifest for storage areas"</a> article.</p>

<p>For Firefox, you need to create a JSON manifest file in a specific format, in a specific location. For the details of manifest syntax and location, see <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_manifests">Native manifests</a>.</p>

<p>Here's an example manifest:</p>

<pre class="brush: json">{
  "name": "favorite-color-examples@mozilla.org",
  "description": "ignored",
  "type": "storage",
  "data":
  {
    "color": "management thinks it should be blue!"
  }
}</pre>

<p>Given this manifest, the "favorite-color-examples@mozilla.org" extension could access the data using code like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">var storageItem = browser.storage.managed.get('color');
storageItem.then((res) =&gt; {
  console.log(`Managed color is: ${res.color}`);
});</pre>
