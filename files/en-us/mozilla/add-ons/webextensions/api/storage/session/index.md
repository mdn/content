{{AddonSidebar()}}

Represents the `session` storage area. Items in `session` storage are stored in memory for the duration of the browser session and are not persisted to disk.
By default, it's not exposed to content scripts, but this behavior can be changed through {{WebExtAPIRef("storage.StorageArea.setAccessLevel", "storage.session.setAccessLevel()")}}.

The amount of data that an extension can store in the session storage area is limited to 10 MB, unless stated otherwise in the [browser compatibility table](#browser_compatibility).

When the browser stops, all session storage is cleared. When the extension is uninstalled, its associated session storage is cleared.

## Methods

The `session` object implements the methods defined on the {{WebExtAPIRef("storage.StorageArea")}} type:

- {{WebExtAPIRef("storage.StorageArea.get()", "storage.session.get()")}}
  - : Retrieves one or more items from the storage area.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("storage.StorageArea.getBytesInUse()", "storage.session.getBytesInUse()")}}
  - : Gets the amount of storage space (in bytes) used for one or more items in the storage area.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("storage.StorageArea.set()", "storage.session.set()")}}
  - : Stores one or more items in the storage area. If the item exists, its value is updated.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("storage.StorageArea.setAccessLevel", "storage.session.setAccessLevel()")}}
  - : Sets the access level for the storage area.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("storage.StorageArea.remove()", "storage.session.remove()")}}
  - : Removes one or more items from the storage area.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("storage.StorageArea.clear()", "storage.session.clear()")}}
  - : Removes all items from the storage area.

## Events

The `session` object implements the events defined on the {{WebExtAPIRef("storage.StorageArea")}} type:

- {{WebExtAPIRef("storage.StorageArea.onChanged", "storage.session.onChanged")}}
  - : Fires when one or more items in the storage area change.
