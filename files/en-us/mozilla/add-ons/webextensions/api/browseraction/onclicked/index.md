{{AddonSidebar()}}

Fired when a browser action icon is clicked. This event will not fire if the browser action has a popup.

To define a right-click action, use the [`contextMenus`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/menus "Add items to the browser's context menu, to be displayed in the contexts you specify. For example, you can show the item only when the user clicks on an image, or on an editable element, or when part of a page is selected.") API with the "browser_action" [context type](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/menus/ContextType "The different contexts a menu can appear in.").

## Syntax

```js
browser.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(listener)
browser.browserAction.onClicked.removeListener(listener)
browser.browserAction.onClicked.hasListener(listener)
```

Events have three functions:

- `addListener(listener)`
  - : Adds a listener to this event.
- `removeListener(listener)`
  - : Stop listening to this event. The `listener` argument is the listener to remove.
- `hasListener(listener)`
  - : Check whether `listener` is registered for this event. Returns `true` if it is listening, `false` otherwise.

### Parameters

- `callback`

  - : Function that will be called when this event occurs. The function will be passed the following arguments:

    - `tab`
      - : {{WebExtAPIRef('tabs.Tab')}}. The tab that was active when the icon was clicked.
    - `OnClickData`

      - : An object containing information about the click.

        - `modifiers`
          - : An `array`. The keyboard modifiers active at the time of the click, being one or more of `Shift`, `Alt`, `Command`, `Ctrl`, or `MacCtrl`.
        - `button`
          - : An `integer`. Indicates the button used to click the page action icon: `0` for a left-click or a click not associated with a mouse, such as one from the keyboard and `1` for a middle button or wheel click. Note that the right-click is not supported because Firefox consumes that click to display the context menu before this event is triggered.

    ## Examples

    When the user clicks the icon, disable it for the active tab, and log the tab's URL:

    ```js
    browser.browserAction.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
      // disable the active tab
      browser.browserAction.disable(tab.id);
      // requires the "tabs" or "activeTab" permission, or host permissions for the URL
      console.log(tab.url);
    });
    ```
