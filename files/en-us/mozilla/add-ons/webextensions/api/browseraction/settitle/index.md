{{AddonSidebar}}

Sets the browser action's title. The title is displayed in a tooltip over the browser action's icon. You can pass a `tabId` in or a `windowId` as an optional parameter â€” if you do this then the title is changed only for the given tab or the given window. Tabs or windows without a specific title will inherit the global title text, which defaults to the [`default_title`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/browser_action) or [`name`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/name) specified in the manifest.

## Syntax

```js
browser.browserAction.setTitle(
  details // object
)
```

### Parameters

- `details`

  - : `object`. The new title and optionally the ID of the tab or window to target.

    - `title`

      - : `string` or `null`. The string the browser action should display when moused over.

        If `title` is an empty string, the used title will be the extension name, but {{WebExtAPIRef("browserAction.getTitle")}} will still provide the empty string.

        If `title` is `null`:

        - If `tabId` is specified, and the tab has a tab-specific title set, then the tab will inherit the title from the window to which it belongs.
        - if `windowId` is specified, and the window has a window-specific title set, then the window will inherit the global title.
        - Otherwise, the global title will be reset to the manifest title.

    - `tabId`{{Optional_Inline}}
      - : `integer`. Sets the title only for the given tab.
    - `windowId`{{Optional_Inline}}
      - : `integer`. Sets the title for the given window.

<!---->

- If `windowId` and `tabId` are both supplied, the function fails and the title is not set.
- If `windowId` and `tabId` are both omitted, the global title is set.

## Examples

This code switches the title between "this" and "that" each time the user clicks the browser action:

```js
function toggleTitle(title) {
  if (title == "this") {
    browser.browserAction.setTitle({title: "that"});
  } else {
    browser.browserAction.setTitle({title: "this"});
  }
}

browser.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(() => {
  var gettingTitle = browser.browserAction.getTitle({});
  gettingTitle.then(toggleTitle);
});
```
