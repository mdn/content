Details about the format, quality, area and scale of a captured image.

## Type

Values of this type are objects. They contain the following properties:

- `format`{{optional_inline}}
  - : {{WebExtAPIRef('extensionTypes.ImageFormat')}}. The format of the resulting image. Default is `"png"`.
- `quality`{{optional_inline}}
  - : `integer`. When format is `"jpeg"`, this controls the quality of the resulting image. It is a number between 0 and 100, which is converted to a value between 0 and 1 and then used as the `encoderOptions` argument to [`HTMLCanvasElement.toDataURL()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toDataURL). If it is omitted, 92 is used. As quality is decreased, the resulting image will have more visual artifacts, and the number of bytes needed to store it will decrease. This value is ignored for PNG images.
- `rect`{{optional_inline}}

  - : An `object` specifying the area of the document to capture, in CSS pixels, relative to the page. All properties default to `0`. The properties are:

    - `x`: The coordinate of the left side of the rectangle.
    - `y`: The coordinate of the top side of the rectangle.
    - `width`: The width of the rectangle.
    - `height`: The height of the rectangle.

    This option was introduced in Firefox 82.Â  If omitted, the currently visible viewport is captured.

- `scale`{{optional_inline}}
  - : `number`. The scale to render at, defaults to [`devicePixelRatio`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/devicePixelRatio). This option was introduced in Firefox 82.
