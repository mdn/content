{{AddonSidebar()}}

Gets details about a window, given its ID. The details are passed into a callback.

This is an asynchronous function that returns a [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

## Syntax

```js
var getting = browser.windows.get(
  windowId,              // integer
  getInfo                // optional object
)
```

### Parameters

- `windowId`
  - : `integer`. The ID of the window object you want returned.
- `getInfo`{{optional_inline}}

  - : `object`. Contains options to filter the type of window.

    - `populate`{{optional_inline}}
      - : `boolean`. If `true`, the {{WebExtAPIRef('windows.Window')}} object will have a `tabs` property that contains a list of {{WebExtAPIRef('tabs.Tab')}} objects representing the tabs open in the window. The `Tab` objects only contain the `url`, `title` and `favIconUrl` properties if the extension's manifest file includes the `"tabs"` permission or a matching [host permission](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#host_permissions).
    - `windowTypes`{{optional_inline}}
      - : `array` of {{WebExtAPIRef('windows.WindowType')}} objects. If set, the {{WebExtAPIRef('windows.Window')}} returned will be filtered based on its type. If unset the default filter is set to `['normal', 'panel', 'popup']`, with `'panel'` window types limited to the extension's own windows.

> **Note:** If supplied, the `windowTypes` component of `getInfo` is ignored. The use of `windowTypes` has been deprecated as of Firefox 62.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that will be fulfilled with a {{WebExtAPIRef('windows.Window')}} object containing the details of the window. If any error occurs, the promise will be rejected with an error message.

## Examples

This example gets the current window and logs the URLs of the tabs it contains. Note that you'll need the "tabs" [permission](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions) or matching [host permissions](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#host_permissions) to access tab URLs.

> **Note:** This example is a bit unrealistic: in this situation you would more probably use {{WebExtAPIRef("windows.getCurrent()")}}.

```js
function logTabs(windowInfo) {
  for (tabInfo of windowInfo.tabs) {
    console.log(tabInfo.url);
  }
}

function onError(error) {
  console.log(`Error: ${error}`);
}

browser.browserAction.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
  var getting = browser.windows.get(tab.windowId, {populate: true});
  getting.then(logTabs, onError);
});
```
