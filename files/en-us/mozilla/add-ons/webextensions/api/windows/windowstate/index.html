<p>The state of this browser window.</p>

<h2 id="Type">Type</h2>

<p>Values of this type are <code>strings</code>. Possible values are:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><code>"normal"</code></dt>
 <dd>The window is at the default size or user-selected size.</dd>
 <dt><code>"minimized"</code></dt>
 <dd>The window is only visible as an icon in the taskbar or .</dd>
 <dt><code>"maximized"</code></dt>
 <dd>The window fills the screen on which it is displayed not including any screen areas reserved by the operating system.</dd>
 <dt><code>"fullscreen"</code></dt>
 <dd>The window is running as a full screen application or content in a tab is using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fullscreen_API">Fullscreen API</a></dd>
 <dt><code>"docked"</code></dt>
 <dd>A docked window occupies a fixed position relative to other windows owned by the same application.</dd>
</dl>

<p>macOS compatibility: Beginning in macOS 10.10, the default maximizing behavior for windows changed to run applications as full screen applications instead of "zoomed" windows. <code>fullscreen</code> refers to both the browser running as a full screen application and when content in a tab uses the Fullscreen API.</p>
