{{AddonSidebar()}}

Fired when a bookmark item (a bookmark or a folder) is created.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
browser.bookmarks.onCreated.addListener()
browser.bookmarks.onCreated.removeListener(listener)
browser.bookmarks.onCreated.hasListener(listener)
```

Events have three functions:

- `addListener(listener)`
  - : Adds a listener to this event.
- `removeListener(listener)`
  - : Stop listening to this event. The `listener` argument is the listener to remove.
- `hasListener(listener)`
  - : Check whether `listener` is registered for this event. Returns `true` if it is listening, `false` otherwise.

## addListener syntax

### Parameters

- `listener`

  - : The function called when this event occurs. The function is passed these arguments:

    - `id`
      - : `string`. The new bookmark item's ID.
    - `bookmark`
      - : {{WebExtAPIRef('bookmarks.BookmarkTreeNode')}}. Information about the new bookmark item.

## Examples

```js
function handleCreated(id, bookmarkInfo) {
  console.log(`New bookmark ID: ${id}`);
  console.log(`New bookmark URL: ${bookmarkInfo.url}`);
}

browser.bookmarks.onCreated.addListener(handleCreated);
```
