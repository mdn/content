The **`bookmarks.search()`** function searches for bookmark tree nodes matching the given query.

This function throws an exception if any of the input parameters are invalid or are not of an appropriate type; look in the [console](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/debugging/) for the error message. The exceptions don't have error IDs, and the messages themselves may change, so don't write code that tries to interpret them.

This is an asynchronous function that returns a [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

## Syntax

```js
var searching = browser.bookmarks.search(
  query                  // string or object
)
```

### Parameters

- `query`

  - : A {{jsxref("string")}} or {{jsxref("object")}} describing the query to perform.

    If `query` is a **string**, it consists of zero or more space-delimited search terms. Each search term matches if it is a substring in the bookmark's URL or title. Matching is case-insensitive. For a bookmark to match the query, all the query's search terms must be matched.

    If `query` is an **object**, it consists of zero or more of 3 properties: `query`, `title`, and `url`, which are described below. For a bookmark to match the query, all the properties' terms must be matched.

    - `query` {{optional_inline}}
      - : A {{jsxref("string")}} specifying one or more terms to match against; the format is identical to the string form of the `query` parameter. If this isn't a string, an exception is thrown.
    - `url` {{optional_inline}}

      - : A {{jsxref("string")}} that must exactly match the bookmark's URL. Matching is case-insensitive, and trailing slashes are ignored.

        If you pass an invalid URL, the function will throw an exception.

    - `title` {{optional_inline}}
      - : A {{jsxref("string")}} that must exactly match the bookmark tree node's title. Matching is case-sensitive.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that will be fulfilled with an array of {{WebExtAPIRef('bookmarks.BookmarkTreeNode')}} objects, each representing a single matching bookmark tree node. Results are returned in the order that the nodes were created. The array is empty if no results were found.

The [`BookmarkTreeNodes`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/bookmarks/BookmarkTreeNode)—even nodes of the `"folder"` type—returned by `bookmarks.search()` are missing the `children` property. To get a complete `BookmarkTreeNode` use [`bookmarks.getSubTree()`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/bookmarks/getSubTree).

## Example

This example logs the IDs of all bookmarks:

```js
function onFulfilled(bookmarkItems) {
  for (item of bookmarkItems) {
    console.log(item.id);
  }
}

function onRejected(error) {
  console.log(`An error: ${error}`);
}

var searching = browser.bookmarks.search({});

searching.then(onFulfilled, onRejected);
```

This example looks to see if the currently active tab is bookmarked:

```js
function onFulfilled(bookmarkItems) {
  if (bookmarkItems.length) {
    console.log("active tab is bookmarked");
  } else {
    console.log("active tab is not bookmarked");
  }
}

function onRejected(error) {
  console.log(`An error: ${error}`);
}

function checkActiveTab(tab) {
  var searching = browser.bookmarks.search({url: tab.url});
  searching.then(onFulfilled, onRejected);
}

browser.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(checkActiveTab);
```
