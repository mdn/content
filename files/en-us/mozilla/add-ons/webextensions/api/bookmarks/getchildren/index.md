{{AddonSidebar()}}

**`bookmarks.getChildren()`** retrieves all the immediate children of a given bookmark folder, identified as a {{WebExtAPIRef("bookmarks.BookmarkTreeNode", "BookmarkTreeNode")}} ID.

This is an asynchronous function that returns a [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

## Syntax

```js
var gettingChildren = browser.bookmarks.getChildren(
  id                     // string
)
```

### Parameters

- `id`
  - : A {{jsxref("string")}} which specifies the ID of the folder whose children are to be retrieved.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that will be fulfilled with an array of [`BookmarkTreeNode`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/bookmarks/BookmarkTreeNode "An object of type bookmarks.BookmarkTreeNode represents a node in the bookmark tree, where each node is a bookmark or bookmark folder. Child nodes are ordered by an index within their respective parent folders.") objects. Each entry represents a single child node. The list is ordered in the same order in which the bookmarks appear in the user interface. Separators are currently not included in the results. The list includes subfolders, but does not include any children contained in subfolders.

If the specified node has no children, the array is empty.

If the node identified by `id` is not found, the promise is rejected with an error message.

## Examples

```js
function onFulfilled(children) {
  for (child of children) {
    console.log(child.id);
  }
}

function onRejected(error) {
  console.log(`An error: ${error}`);
}

var gettingChildren = browser.bookmarks.getChildren("unfiled_____");
gettingChildren.then(onFulfilled, onRejected);
```
