<p>The <strong><code>bookmarks.BookmarkTreeNodeUnmodifiable</code></strong> type is used to indicate the reason that a node in the bookmark tree (where each node is either a bookmark or a bookmark folder) cannot be changed. This is used as the value of the {{WebExtAPIRef("bookmarks.BookmarkTreeNode", "bookmarks.BookmarkTreeNode.unmodifiable", "unmodifiable")}} field on bookmark nodes.</p>

<h2 id="Type">Type</h2>

<p><code>bookmarks.BookmarkTreeNodeUnmodifiable</code> is a {{jsxref("string")}} which can currently have only one value: <code>"managed"</code>. This indicates that the bookmark node was configured by an administrator or by the custodian of a supervised user (such as a parent, in the case of parental controls).</p>
