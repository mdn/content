{{AddonSidebar()}}

Fired when the children of a folder have changed their order due to the order being sorted in the UI. This is not called as a result of a call to {{WebExtAPIRef("bookmarks.move()")}} or a drag operation in the UI.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
browser.bookmarks.onChildrenReordered.addListener(listener)
browser.bookmarks.onChildrenReordered.removeListener(listener)
browser.bookmarks.onChildrenReordered.hasListener(listener)
```

Events have three functions:

- `addListener(listener)`
  - : Adds a listener to this event.
- `removeListener(listener)`
  - : Stop listening to this event. The `listener` argument is the listener to remove.
- `hasListener(listener)`
  - : Check whether `listener` is registered for this event. Returns `true` if it is listening, `false` otherwise.

## addListener syntax

### Parameters

- `listener`

  - : The function called when this event occurs. The function is passed these arguments:

    - `id`
      - : `string`. ID of the folder whose children were reordered.
    - `reorderInfo`
      - : `object`. Object containing Additional objects. See the [reorderInfo](#reorderinfo_2) section for more details.

## Additional objects

### reorderInfo

- `childIds`
  - : `array` of `string`. Array containing the IDs of all the bookmark items in this folder, in the order they now appear in the UI.

## Browser compatibility

{{Compat}}

## Examples

```js
function handleChildrenReordered(id, reorderInfo) {
  console.log(`Item: ${id} children reordered`);
  console.log(`Children: ${reorderInfo.childIds}`);
}

function handleClick() {
  browser.bookmarks.onChildrenReordered.addListener(handleChildrenReordered);
}

browser.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(handleClick);
```
