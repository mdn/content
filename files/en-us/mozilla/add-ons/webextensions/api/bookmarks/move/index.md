The **`bookmarks.move()`** method moves the specified {{WebExtAPIRef("bookmarks.BookmarkTreeNode", "BookmarkTreeNode")}} to the specified destination within the tree of bookmarks. This lets you move a bookmark to a new folder and/or position within the folder.

> **Warning:** If your extension attempts to move a bookmark into the bookmarks tree root node, the call will raise an error with the message: "_The bookmark root cannot be modified_" and the move won't be completed.

This is an asynchronous function that returns a [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

## Syntax

```js
var movingBookmark = browser.bookmarks.move(
  id,                    // string
  destination           // object
)
```

### Parameters

- `id`
  - : A {{jsxref("string")}} containing the ID of the bookmark or folder to move.
- `destination`

  - : An {{jsxref("object")}} which specifies the destination for the bookmark. This object must contain one or both of the following fields:

    - `parentId` {{optional_inline}}
      - : A {{jsxref("string")}} which specifies the ID of the destination folder. If this value is left out, the bookmark is moved to a new location within its current folder.
    - `index` {{optional_inline}}
      - : A 0-based index specifying the position within the folder to which to move the bookmark. A value of 0 moves the bookmark to the top of the folder. If this value is omitted, the bookmark is placed at the end of the new parent folder.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that will be fulfilled with a single [`bookmarks.BookmarkTreeNode`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/bookmarks/BookmarkTreeNode "An object of type bookmarks.BookmarkTreeNode represents a node in the bookmark tree, where each node is a bookmark or bookmark folder. Child nodes are ordered by an index within their respective parent folders.") object, describing the moved node.

If the node corresponding to the `id` parameter can't be found, the promise is rejected with an error message.

## Examples

This example moves a bookmark so that it's the first bookmark in its current folder.

```js
function onMoved(bookmarkItem) {
  console.log(bookmarkItem.index);
}

function onRejected(error) {
  console.log(`An error: ${error}`);
}

var bookmarkId = "abcdefghilkl";

var movingBookmark = browser.bookmarks.move(bookmarkId, {index: 0});
movingBookmark.then(onMoved, onRejected);
```
