{{AddonSidebar()}}

The `bookmarks.getRecent()` method retrieves a specified number of the most recently added bookmarks as an array of {{WebExtAPIRef('bookmarks.BookmarkTreeNode', 'BookmarkTreeNode')}} objects.

This is an asynchronous function that returns a [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

## Syntax

```js
var gettingRecent = browser.bookmarks.getRecent(
  numberOfItems          // integer
)
```

### Parameters

- `numberOfItems`
  - : A number representing the maximum number of items to return. The returned list will contain up to this many of the most recently added items. The minimum allowed value here is 1. If you pass 0 or less, the function will throw an error.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that will be fulfilled with an array of [`BookmarkTreeNode`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/bookmarks/BookmarkTreeNode "An object of type bookmarks.BookmarkTreeNode represents a node in the bookmark tree, where each node is a bookmark or bookmark folder. Child nodes are ordered by an index within their respective parent folders.") objects.

## Examples

This example logs the URL for the most recently added bookmark:

```js
function onFulfilled(bookmarks) {
  for (bookmark of bookmarks) {
    console.log(bookmark.url);
  }
}

function onRejected(error) {
  console.log(`An error: ${error}`);
}

var gettingRecent = browser.bookmarks.getRecent(1);
gettingRecent.then(onFulfilled, onRejected);
```
