<div>{{AddonSidebar()}}</div>

<p>Defines whether zoom changes will persist for the page's origin, or only take effect in this tab. This defaults to <code>per-origin</code> when {{WebExtAPIRef("tabs.zoomSettingsMode")}} is "automatic", and is always <code>per-tab</code> otherwise.</p>

<h2 id="Type">Type</h2>

<p>Values of this type are strings. Possible values are:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>"per-origin"</dt>
 <dd>All other tabs with the same origin as this tab will have the zoom changes applied to them. This scope is only available ifÂ {{WebExtAPIRef("tabs.zoomSettingsMode")}} is "automatic".</dd>
 <dt>"per-tab"</dt>
 <dd>Zoom changes only take effect in this tab, and zoom changes in other tabs will not affect the zooming of this tab. Also:
 <ul>
  <li>in Firefox the zoom level persists across page loads and navigation within the tab.</li>
  <li>in Chrome-based browsers zoom changes are reset on navigation; navigating a tab will always load pages with their per-origin zoom factors.</li>
 </ul>
 </dd>
</dl>
