{{AddonSidebar()}}

Removes from a page CSS which was previously injected by a call to {{WebExtAPIRef("tabs.insertCSS()")}}.

This is an asynchronous function that returns a [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

## Syntax

```js
var removing = browser.tabs.removeCSS(
  tabId,           // optional integer
  details          // object
)
```

### Parameters

- `tabId` {{optional_inline}}
  - : `integer`. The ID of the tab from which to remove the CSS. Defaults to the active tab of the current window.
- `details`

  - : An object describing the CSS to remove from the page. It contains the following properties:

    - `allFrames`{{optional_inline}}
      - : `boolean`. If `true`, the code will be removed from all frames of the current page. If it is `false`, code is only removed from the top frame. Defaults to `false`.
    - `code`{{optional_inline}}
      - : `string`. CSS to remove, as a text string. This must exactly match a CSS string previously inserted into the page using {{WebExtAPIRef("tabs.insertCSS()")}}.
    - `cssOrigin`{{optional_inline}}
      - : `string`. This can take one of two values: "user", for CSS added as a user stylesheet, or "author" for CSS added as an author stylesheet. If this option was set previously by {{WebExtAPIRef("tabs.insertCSS()")}}, then it must exactly match.
    - `file`{{optional_inline}}
      - : `string`. Path to a file containing the CSS to remove. This must exactly match a CSS file previously inserted into the page using {{WebExtAPIRef("tabs.insertCSS()")}}.
    - `frameId`{{optional_inline}}
      - : `integer`. The frame from which to remove the CSS. Defaults to `0` (the top-level frame).
    - `matchAboutBlank`{{optional_inline}}
      - : `boolean`. If `true`, the CSS will be removed from embedded "about:blank" and "about:srcdoc" frames if your extension has access to their parent document. Defaults to `false`.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that will be fulfilled with no arguments when all the CSS has been removed. If any error occurs, the promise will be rejected with an error message.

## Examples

This example adds some CSS using {{WebExtAPIRef("tabs.insertCSS")}}, then removes it again when the user clicks a browser action:

```js
var css = "body { border: 20px dotted pink; }";

function onError(error) {
  console.log(`Error: ${error}`);
}

var insertingCSS = browser.tabs.insertCSS(2, {code: css});
insertingCSS.then(null, onError);

browser.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(() => {
  var removing = browser.tabs.removeCSS(2, {code: css});
  removing.then(null, onError);
});
```
