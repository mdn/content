{{AddonSidebar}}

Injects a user script into a target context (e.g., tab or frame).

> [!NOTE]
> By default, the injected script is executed at `document_idle`, or immediately if the page is loaded. If the `injectImmediately` property is set to `true`, the script injects without waiting, even if the page is loading.

## Syntax

```js
let executeUserScript = browser.userScripts.execute(
  injection, // array of objects
);
```

### Parameters

- `injection`
  - : An array of objects specifying what user scripts to inject, where, and how.
    - `injectImmediately` {{optional_inline}}
      - : `boolean`. If set to `true`, the injection is triggered as soon as possible in the target context. This doesn't guarantee that the injection occurs before the page finishes loading, as the page may load before the script has reached the target.

    - `js`
      - : `array` of {{WebExtAPIRef("userScripts.ScriptSource")}}. The scripts to inject into matching pages.
    - `target`
      - : An object that defines the target context scripts are injected into.
        - `allFrames` {{optional_inline}}
          - : `boolean`. If set to `true`, the script is injected into all available frames. Defaults to `false`, in which the script is only injected into the top frame.
        - `documentIds` {{optional_inline}}
          - : `array` of `string`. The IDs of the documents to inject into. Must not be specified if `frameIds` is set.
        - `frameIds` {{optional_inline}}
          - : `array` of `integer`. The IDs of the frames to inject into. Must not be specified if `documentIds` is set.
        - `tabId`
          - : `integer`. The ID of a tab to inject into.
    - `world` {{optional_inline}}
      - : {{WebExtAPIRef("userScripts.ExecutionWorld")}}. The execution environment to use to run the scripts. Defaults to `"USER_SCRIPT"`.
    - `worldId` {{optional_inline}}
      - : `string`. ID of a user script world the script executes in. Only valid if `world` is `USER_SCRIPT` or omitted. If `worldId` is omitted, the script is executed in the default `USER_SCRIPT` world (""). Values with leading underscores (`_`) are reserved. The maximum length is 256 characters. A world can be used by several scripts as their execution environment. To configure the behavior of a world, pass its `worldId` to {{WebExtAPIRef("userScripts.configureWorld")}} before the first script executes in that world.

### Return Value

A {{JSxRef("Promise")}} fulfilled with an array of objects describing the outcome of the injection with these properties:

- `documentId`
  - : `string`. Document ID associated with the injection.
- `error` {{optional_inline}}
  - : `string`. Error message if any. This is mutually exclusive with `result`
- `frameId`
  - : `integer`. Frame ID associated with the injection.
- `result` {{optional_inline}}
  - : `string`. Result of the script injection if any. This is mutually exclusive with `error`

## Examples

```js
await browser.userScripts.execute([
  {
    js: [{ code: "console.log('Hello world!');" }],
    target: { tabId: 1 },
  },
]);
```
