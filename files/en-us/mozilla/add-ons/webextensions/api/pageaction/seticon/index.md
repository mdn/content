{{AddonSidebar()}}

Sets the icon for the page action.

You can specify a single icon as either the path to an image file or a {{WebExtAPIRef('pageAction.ImageDataType')}} object.

You can specify multiple icons in different sizes by supplying a dictionary containing multiple paths or `ImageData` objects. This means the icon doesn't have to be scaled for a device with a different pixel density.

This is an asynchronous function that returns a [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

## Syntax

```js
var settingIcon = browser.pageAction.setIcon(
  details         // object
)
```

### Parameters

- `details`

  - : `object`. An object containing either `imageData` or `path` properties, and a `tabId` property.

    - `imageData`{{optional_inline}}

      - : `{{WebExtAPIRef('pageAction.ImageDataType')}}` or `object`. This is either a single `ImageData` object or a dictionary object.

        Use a dictionary object to specify multiple `ImageData` objects in different sizes, so the icon does not have to be scaled for a device with a different pixel density. If `imageData` is a dictionary, the value of each property is an `ImageData` object, and its name is its size, like this:

        ```json
        {
          16: image16,
          32: image32
        }
        ```

        The browser will choose the image to use depending on the screen's pixel density. See [Choosing icon sizes](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/browser_action#choosing_icon_sizes) for more information on this.

    - `path`{{optional_inline}}

      - : `string` or `object`. This is either a relative path to an icon file or a dictionary object.

        Use a dictionary object to specify multiple icon files in different sizes, so the icon does not have to be scaled for a device with a different pixel density. If `path` is a dictionary, the value of each property is a relative path, and its name is its size, like this:

        ```json
        {
          16: "path/to/image16.jpg",
          32: "path/to/image32.jpg"
        }
        ```

        The browser will choose the image to use depending on the screen's pixel density. See [Choosing icon sizes](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/browser_action#choosing_icon_sizes) for more information on this.

        If `path` is `null`, this will reset the page action's icon to the icon that was given in the [`page_action`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/page_action) manifest key.

        If `path` is `""`, this will reset the icon to the browser's global default icon (that is, the icon used if no icon is given in the [`page_action`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/page_action) manifest key).

        If `path` does not point to a valid icon, then no icon will be displayed.

    - `tabId`
      - : `integer`. The ID of the tab whose icon you want to set.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that will be fulfilled with no arguments once the icon has been set.

## Browser compatibility

{{Compat}}

## Examples

Set the icon for the page action when the user clicks it:

```js
browser.pageAction.onClicked.addListener((tab) => {
  browser.pageAction.setIcon({
    tabId: tab.id, path: "icons/icon-48.png"
  });
});
```
