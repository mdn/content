{{AddonSidebar()}}

Sets the HTML document to be opened as a popup when the user clicks on the page action's icon.

## Syntax

```js
browser.pageAction.setPopup(
  details // object
)
```

### Parameters

- `details`

  - : `object`.

    - `tabId`
      - : `integer`. The ID of the tab for which you want to set the popup.
    - `popup`

      - : `string` or `null`. URL to the HTML file to show in a popup.

        If an empty string (`""`) is passed here, the popup is disabled, and the extension will receive {{WebExtAPIRef("pageAction.onClicked")}} events.

        If `null` is passed here, the popup is reset to the popup that was specified in the [`page_action`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/page_action) manifest key.

## Browser compatibility

{{Compat}}

## Examples

Listen for {{WebExtAPIRef("tabs.onUpdated")}} events, and switch the popup if the loading status changes:

```js
browser.tabs.onUpdated.addListener((tabId, changeInfo, tabInfo) => {
  if (changeInfo.status) {
    browser.pageAction.show(tabId);
    if (changeInfo.status == "loading") {
      browser.pageAction.setPopup({
        tabId,
        popup: "/popup/loading.html"
      });
    } else {
      browser.pageAction.setPopup({
        tabId,
        popup: "/popup/complete.html"
      });
    }
  }
});
```
