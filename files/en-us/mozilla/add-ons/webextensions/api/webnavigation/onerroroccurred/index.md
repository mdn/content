{{AddonSidebar()}}

Fired when an error occurs and the navigation is aborted. This can happen if either a network error occurred, or the user aborted the navigation.

## Syntax

```js
browser.webNavigation.onErrorOccurred.addListener(
  listener,                   // function
  filter                      // optional object
)
browser.webNavigation.onErrorOccurred.removeListener(listener)
browser.webNavigation.onErrorOccurred.hasListener(listener)
```

Events have three functions:

- `addListener(listener)`

  `addListener(listener, filter)`

  - : Adds a listener to this event.

- `removeListener(listener)`
  - : Stop listening to this event. The `listener` argument is the listener to remove.
- `hasListener(listener)`
  - : Check whether `listener` is registered for this event. Returns `true` if it is listening, `false` otherwise.

## addListener syntax

### Parameters

- `listener`

  - : Function that will be called when this event occurs.

    The `listener` function will be called with the following arguments:

    - `details`

      - : [`object`](#details). Details about the navigation event. **`details`** has the following properties:

        - `tabId`
          - : `integer`. The ID of the tab in which the navigation was happening.
        - `url`
          - : `string`. The URL to which the given frame was navigating.
        - `processId`
          - : `integer`. The ID of the process in which this tab is being rendered.
        - `frameId`

          - : `integer`. Frame in which the navigation was happening.

            `0` indicates that navigation happened in the tab's top-level browsing context, not in a nested {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}.

            A positive value indicates that navigation happened in a nested iframe.

            Frame IDs are unique for a given tab and process.

        - `timeStamp`
          - : `number`. The time at which the error occurred, in [milliseconds since the epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).
        - `error`
          - : `string`. The error code. This is an internal error code, and is not guaranteed to stay the same or be consistent from one browser to another.

- `filter`{{optional_inline}}

  - : `object`. An object containing a single property `url`, which is an `Array` of {{WebExtAPIRef("events.UrlFilter")}} objects.

    If you include this parameter, then the event will fire only for transitions to URLs which match at least one `UrlFilter` in the array.

    If you omit this parameter, the event will fire for all transitions.

## Browser compatibility

## Examples

Logs the target URLs for `onErrorOccurred`, if the target URL's `hostname` contains `"example.com"` or starts with `"developer"`.

```js
const filter = {
  url:
  [
    {hostContains: "example.com"},
    {hostPrefix: "developer"}
  ]
}

function logOnErrorOccurred(details) {
  console.log(`onErrorOccurred: ${details.url}`);
  console.log(details.error);
}

browser.webNavigation.onErrorOccurred.addListener(logOnErrorOccurred, filter);
```
