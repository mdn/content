<p>Cause of the navigation: for example, the user clicked a link, or typed an address, or clicked a bookmark.</p>

<p>Note that many values here are not currently supported in Firefox: see the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/webNavigation/TransitionType#browser_compatibility">browser compatibility table</a> for details.</p>

<h2 id="Type">Type</h2>

<p>Values of this type are strings. Possible values are:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><a id="value-link"></a>"link"</dt>
 <dd>The user clicked a link in another page.</dd>
 <dt><a id="value-typed"></a>"typed"</dt>
 <dd>The user typed the URL into the address bar. This is also used if the user started typing into the address bar, then selected a URL from the suggestions it offered. See also "generated".</dd>
 <dt><a id="value-auto_bookmark"></a>"auto_bookmark"</dt>
 <dd>The user clicked a bookmark or an item in the browser history.</dd>
 <dt><a id="value-auto_subframe"></a>"auto_subframe"</dt>
 <dd>Any nested iframes that are automatically loaded by their parent.</dd>
 <dt><a id="value-manual_subframe"></a>"manual_subframe"</dt>
 <dd>Any nested iframes that are loaded as an explicit user action. Loading such an iframe will generate an entry in the back/forward navigation list.</dd>
 <dt><a id="value-generated"></a>"generated"</dt>
 <dd>The user started typing in the address bar, then clicked on a suggested entry that didn't contain a URL.</dd>
 <dt><a id="value-start_page"></a>"start_page"</dt>
 <dd>The page was passed to the command line or is the start page.</dd>
 <dt><a id="value-form_submit"></a>"form_submit"</dt>
 <dd>The user submitted a form. Note that in some situations, such as when a form uses a script to submit its contents, submitting a form does not result in this transition type.</dd>
 <dt><a id="value-reload"></a>"reload"</dt>
 <dd>The user reloaded the page, using the Reload button or by pressing Enter in the address bar. This is also used for session restore and reopening closed tabs.</dd>
 <dt><a id="value-keyword"></a>"keyword"</dt>
 <dd>The URL was generated using a <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-search-from-address-bar">keyword search</a> configured by the user.</dd>
 <dt><a id="value-keyword_generated"></a>"keyword_generated"</dt>
 <dd>Corresponds to a visit generated for a keyword.</dd>
</dl>
