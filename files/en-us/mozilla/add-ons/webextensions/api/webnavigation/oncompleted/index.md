{{AddonSidebar()}}

Fired when a document, including the resources it refers to, is completely loaded and initialized. This is equivalent to the DOM [`load`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/load_event) event.

## Syntax

```js
browser.webNavigation.onCompleted.addListener(
  listener,                   // function
  filter                      // optional object
)
browser.webNavigation.onCompleted.removeListener(listener)
browser.webNavigation.onCompleted.hasListener(listener)
```

Events have three functions:

- `addListener(callback)`
  - : Adds a listener to this event.
- `removeListener(listener)`
  - : Stop listening to this event. The `listener` argument is the listener to remove.
- `hasListener(listener)`
  - : Check whether `listener` is registered for this event. Returns `true` if it is listening, `false` otherwise.

## addListener syntax

### Parameters

- `callback`

  - : Function that will be called when this event occurs. The function will be passed the following arguments:

    - `details`
      - : [`object`](#details). Details about the navigation event.

- `filter`{{optional_inline}}
  - : `object`. An object containing a single property `url`, which is an `Array` of {{WebExtAPIRef("events.UrlFilter")}} objects. If you include this parameter, then the event will fire only for transitions to URLs which match at least one `UrlFilter` in the array. If you omit this parameter, the event will fire for all transitions.

## Additional objects

### details

- `tabId`
  - : `integer`. The ID of the tab in which the navigation has occurred.
- `url`
  - : `string`. The URL to which the given frame has navigated.
- `processId`
  - : `integer`. The ID of the process in which this tab is being rendered.
- `frameId`
  - : `integer`. Frame in which the navigation has occurred. `0` indicates that navigation happened in the tab's top-level browsing context, not in a nested {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}. A positive value indicates that navigation happened in a nested iframe. Frame IDs are unique for a given tab and process.
- `timeStamp`
  - : `number`. The time at which the page finished loading, in [milliseconds since the epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

## Browser compatibility

## Examples

Logs the target URLs for `onCompleted`, if the target URL's hostname contains "example.com" or starts with "developer".

```js
const filter = {
  url:
  [
    {hostContains: "example.com"},
    {hostPrefix: "developer"}
  ]
}

function logOnCompleted(details) {
  console.log(`onCompleted: ${details.url}`);
}

browser.webNavigation.onCompleted.addListener(logOnCompleted, filter);
```
