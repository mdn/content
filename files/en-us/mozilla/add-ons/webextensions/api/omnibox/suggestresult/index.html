<p>The <strong><code>omnibox.SuggestResult</code></strong> type defines a single suggestion that the extension can add to the address bar's drop-down list.</p>

<p>The extension's {{WebExtAPIRef("omnibox.onInputChanged")}} event listener is passed a callback. To populate the address bar's drop-down list in response to the user's input, the extension can pass an array of <code>omnibox.SuggestResult</code> objects into this callback.</p>

<h2 id="Type">Type</h2>

<p>Values of this type are objects. They have the following properties:</p>

<dl class="reference-values">
 <dt><code>content</code></dt>
 <dd>This is the value that will appear in the address bar itself when the user highlights this suggestion in the drop-down list. This is also the string sent to the {{WebExtAPIRef("omnibox.onInputEntered")}} event listener if the user selects this suggestion. If the string is the same as what the user has already typed, this entry will not appear in the drop-down list.</dd>
 <dt><code>description</code></dt>
 <dd>This is the string that's displayed in the address bar's drop-down list.</dd>
</dl>
