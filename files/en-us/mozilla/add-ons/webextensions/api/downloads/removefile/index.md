{{AddonSidebar()}}

The **`removeFile()`** function of the {{WebExtAPIRef("downloads")}} API removes a downloaded file from disk.

This API removes the file from disk, but does not remove it from the browser's downloads history, therefore a call to {{WebExtAPIRef("downloads.search()")}} will still return the item as a {{WebExtAPIRef("downloads.DownloadItem", "DownloadItem")}}, but its `exists` attribute will be `false`.

To remove a file from the downloads history, you need to use {{WebExtAPIRef("downloads.erase()")}}.

This is an asynchronous function that returns a [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

> **Note:** If you want to remove a downloaded file from disk _and_ erase it from history, you have to call `removeFile()` before you callÂ {{WebExtAPIRef("downloads.erase()")}}. If you try it the other way around you'll get an error when calling `removeFile()`, because the browser will no longer have a record of the download.

## Syntax

```js
var removing = browser.downloads.removeFile(
  downloadId      // integer
)
```

### Parameters

- `downloadId`
  - : An `integer` representing the id of the {{WebExtAPIRef("downloads.DownloadItem", "DownloadItem")}} you want to delete from disk.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). If the request was successful, the promise will be fulfilled with no arguments. If the request failed, the promise will be rejected with an error message.

## Examples

Remove the most recently downloaded file:

```js
function onRemoved() {
  console.log(`Removed item`);
}

function onError(error) {
  console.log(`Error: ${error}`);
}

function remove(downloadItems) {
  if (downloadItems.length > 0) {
    var removing = browser.downloads.removeFile(downloadItems[0].id);
    removing.then(onRemoved, onError);
  }
}

var searching = browser.downloads.search({
  limit: 1,
  orderBy: ["-startTime"]
});

searching.then(remove, onError);
```
