<p>The <code>State</code> type of the {{WebExtAPIRef("downloads")}} API defines different states that a current download can be in.</p>

<p>A {{WebExtAPIRef('downloads.DownloadItem')}}'s <code>state</code> property will contain a string taken from the values defined in this type.</p>

<h2 id="Type">Type</h2>

<p>Values of this type are strings. Possible values are:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><code>in_progress</code></dt>
 <dd>The browser is currently receiving download data from the server.</dd>
 <dt><code>interrupted</code></dt>
 <dd>An error broke the connection with the server.</dd>
 <dt><code>complete</code></dt>
 <dd>The download completed successfully.</dd>
</dl>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: These string constants will never change, but new constants may be added.</p>
