{{AddonSidebar()}}

The **`show()`** function of the {{WebExtAPIRef("downloads")}} API shows the downloaded file in its containing folder in the underlying platform's file manager.

This is an asynchronous function that returns a [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

## Syntax

```js
var showing = browser.downloads.show(
  downloadId             // integer
)
```

### Parameters

- `downloadId`
  - : An `integer` representing the ID of the {{WebExtAPIRef("downloads.DownloadItem", "DownloadItem")}} to show.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise). If the request succeeds, the promise will be fulfilled with a boolean about whether the request was successful. If the request fails, the promise will be rejected with an error message.

## Examples

This example shows the most recently downloaded item:

```js
function onShowing(success) {
Â  console.log(`Showing download item: ${success}`);
}

function onError(error) {
  console.log(`Error opening item: ${error}`);
}

function openDownload(downloadItems) {
    if (downloadItems.length > 0) {
      latestDownloadId = downloadItems[0].id;
      var showing = browser.downloads.show(latestDownloadId);
      showing.then(onShowing, onError);
    }
  }

var searching = browser.downloads.search({
  limit: 1,
  orderBy: ["-startTime"]
});

searching.then(openDownload, onError);
```
