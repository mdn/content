<div>{{AddonSidebar()}}</div>

<p>The <code>DownloadTime</code> type of the {{WebExtAPIRef("downloads")}} API represents the time a download took to complete.</p>

<h2 id="Type">Type</h2>

<p>A <code>DownloadTime</code> can be one of three different types:</p>

<ul>
 <li>a JavaScript <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date">Date</a></code> object.</li>
 <li>a string:
  <ul>
   <li>if this contains only digits, it's interpreted as the number of milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.</li>
   <li>otherwise, it's interpreted as an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601">ISO 8601</a> string.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>a number: this is interpreted as the number of milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.</li>
</ul>
