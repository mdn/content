{{AddonSidebar()}}

The request or response header to modify for a request, declared in the `rule.action.requestHeaders` array or `rule.action.responseHeaders` array for rules whose {{WebExtAPIRef("declarativeNetRequest.RuleAction", "rule.action")}}`.type` is "modifyHeaders".

Each object describes one header modification. To modify multiple headers, multiple objects can be specified in these arrays, or across multiple rules.

Matching `modifyHeaders` rules are applied in the order described at [Matching precedents](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/declarativeNetRequest#matching_precedents).
Within each extension, all `modifyHeaders` rules with a priority lower than or equal to matching `allow` or `allowAllRequests` rules are ignored.

If multiple `modifyHeaders` rules specify the same header, the resulting modification for the header is determined based on the priority of each rule and the operations specified:

- If a rule has been appended to a header, then lower-priority rules can only append to that header. `set` and `remove` operations are not permitted.
- If a rule has set a header, lower priority rules cannot modify the header except for `append` rules from the same extension.
- If a rule has removed a header, lower priority rules cannot modify the header.

## Type

Values of this type are objects. They contain these properties:

- `header`
  - : A `string`. The name of the header to be modified.
- `operation`
  - : A `string`. The operation to be performed on a header. Possible values are `"append"`, `"set"`, and `"remove"`.
- `value` {{optional_inline}}
  - : A `string`. The new value for the header. Must be specified for append and set operations. Not allowed for the "remove" operation.

## Header limits

In Chrome, `"append"` is supported for the following request headers:

- `Accept`
- `Accept-Encoding`
- `Accept-Language`
- `Access-Control-Request-Headers`
- `Cache-Control`
- `Connection`
- `Content-Language`
- `Cookie`
- `Forwarded`
- `If-Match`
- `If-None-Match`
- `Keep-Alive`
- `Range`
- `Te`
- `Trailer`
- `Transfer-Encoding`
- `Upgrade`
- `Via`
- `Want-Digest`
- `X-Forwarded-For`

In Firefox, the extension needs host permissions for the new value of the `Host` header.
