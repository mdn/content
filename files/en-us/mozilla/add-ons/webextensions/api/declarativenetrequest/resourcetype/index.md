{{AddonSidebar()}}

The resource type of a request. Comparable to {{WebExtAPIRef('webRequest.ResourceType')}}.

## Type

Values of this type are strings. Possible values are:

- `beacon`
  - : Requests sent through the [Beacon API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Beacon_API).
- `csp_report`
  - : Requests sent to the {{CSP("report-uri")}} given in the {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}} header, when an attempt to violate the policy is detected.
- `font`
  - : Web fonts loaded for a {{cssxref("@font-face")}} CSS rule.
- `image`
  - : Resources loaded to be rendered as image, except for `imageset` on browsers that support that type (see browser compatibility below).
- `imageset`
  - : Images loaded by a {{HTMLElement("picture")}} element or given in an `<img>` element's [`srcset`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img#srcset) attribute.
- `main_frame`
  - : Top-level documents loaded into a tab.
- `media`
  - : Resources loaded by a {{HTMLElement("video")}} or {{HTMLElement("audio")}} element.
- `object`

  - : Resources loaded by an {{HTMLElement("object")}} or {{HTMLElement("embed")}} element.

    Browsers that don't have a dedicated `object_subrequest` type (see browser compatibility below), also label subsequent requests sent by the plugin as `object`.

- `object_subrequest`
  - : Requests sent by plugins.
- `ping`

  - : Requests sent to the URL given in a hyperlink's [`ping`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a#ping) attribute, when the hyperlink is followed.

    Browsers that don't have a dedicated `beacon` type (see browser compatibility below), also label requests sent through the Beacon API as `ping`.

- `script`
  - : Code that is loaded to be executed by a {{HTMLElement("script")}} element or running in a [Worker](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API).
- `speculative`
  - : In a speculative connection, the browser has determined that a request to a URI may be coming soon, so it starts a TCP and/or TLS handshake immediately, so it is ready more quickly when the resource is actually requested. Note that this type of connection does not provide valid tab information, so request details such as `tabId`, `frameId`, `parentFrameId`, etc. are inaccurate.
- `stylesheet`
  - : [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) stylesheets loaded to describe the representation of a document.
- `sub_frame`
  - : Documents loaded into an {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} or {{HTMLElement("frame")}} element.
- `web_manifest`
  - : [Web App Manifests](/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) loaded for websites that can be installed to the homescreen.
- `webbundle`
  - : Requests initiating a connection to a server through a Web Bundle or [packaged website](https://github.com/WICG/webpackage).
- `websocket`
  - : Requests initiating a connection to a server through the [WebSocket API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API).
- `webtransport`
  - : Requests initiating a connection to a server through the [WebTransport API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebTransport_API).
- `xml_dtd`
  - : [DTDs](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Doctype) loaded for an XML document.
- `xmlhttprequest`
  - : Requests sent by an {{domxref("XMLHttpRequest")}} object or through the [Fetch API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).
- `xslt`
  - : [XSLT](/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT) stylesheets loaded for transforming an XML document.
- `other`
  - : Resources that aren't covered by any other available type.
