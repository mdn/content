{{AddonSidebar()}}

Modifies the set of scoped rules for the extension. The rules with IDs listed in `options.removeRuleIds` are first removed, and then the rules given in `options.addRules` are added. Note that:

- This update happens as an atomic operation: either all specified rules are added and removed, or an error is returned.
- These rules are not persisted across browser sessions.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("declarativeNetRequest.MAX_NUMBER_OF_DYNAMIC_AND_SESSION_RULES","MAX_NUMBER_OF_DYNAMIC_AND_SESSION_RULES")}} is the maximum number of dynamic and session rules an extension can add.

## Syntax

```js-nolint
let updatedRuleset = browser.declarativeNetRequest.updateSessionRules(
    options                // object
);
```

### Parameters

- `options`

  - : An object containing details of the rules to add or delete from the dynamic rules.
    - `addRules` {{optional_inline}}
      - : An array of {{WebExtAPIRef("declarativeNetRequest.Rule")}}. Details of the rules to add.
    - `removeRuleIds` {{optional_inline}}
      - : An array of `number`. IDs of the rules to remove. Any invalid IDs are ignored.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) If the request was successful, the promise is fulfilled with no arguments. If the request fails, the promise is rejected with an error message.
