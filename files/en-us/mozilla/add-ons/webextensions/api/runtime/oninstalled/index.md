---
{{AddonSidebar()}}

Fired when the extension is first installed, when the extension is updated to a new version, and when the browser is updated to a new version.

Note that `runtime.onInstalled` is not the same as {{WebExtAPIRef("management.onInstalled")}}. The `runtime.onInstalled` event is fired only for your extension. The `browser.management.onInstalled` event is fired for any extensions.

## Syntax

```js
browser.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(listener)
browser.runtime.onInstalled.removeListener(listener)
browser.runtime.onInstalled.hasListener(listener)
```

Events have three functions:

- `addListener(callback)`
  - : Adds a listener to this event.
- `removeListener(listener)`
  - : Stop listening to this event. The `listener` argument is the listener to remove.
- `hasListener(listener)`
  - : Checks whether a `listener` is registered for this event. Returns `true` if it is listening, `false` otherwise.

## addListener syntax

### Parameters

- `function`

  - : The callback function called when this event occurs. The function will be passed the following arguments:

    - `details`

      - : An object with the following properties:

        - `id`{{optional_inline}}
          - : `string`. The ID of the imported shared module extension that updated. This is present only if the `reason` value is `shared_module_update`.
        - `previousVersion`{{optional_inline}}
          - : `string`. The previous version of the extension just updated. This is only present if the `reason` value is `update`.
        - `reason`
          - : An {{WebExtAPIRef('runtime.OnInstalledReason')}} value, stating the reason that this event is being dispatched.
        - `temporary`
          - : `boolean`. True if the add-on was installed temporarily. For example, using the "about:debugging" page in Firefox or using [web-ext run](https://extensionworkshop.com/documentation/develop/getting-started-with-web-ext/). False otherwise.

## Examples

When the extension is installed, log the install reason and open <https://example.com>:

```js
function handleInstalled(details) {
  console.log(details.reason);
  browser.tabs.create({
    url: "https://example.com"
  });
}

browser.runtime.onInstalled.addListener(handleInstalled);
```
