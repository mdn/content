<div>{{AddonSidebar()}}</div>

<p>Sends a single message from an extension to a native application.</p>

<p>This takes two mandatory parameters: the name of the native application and a JSON object which is the message to send it. The browser will launch the native application and deliver the message.</p>

<p>This is an asynchronous function that returns a <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">Promise</a></code>. The first message sent by the native application is treated as a response to the <code>sendNativeMessage()</code> call, and the promise will be fulfilled with this message as a parameter. Note that you can't use {{WebExtAPIRef("runtime.onMessage")}} to get responses from the application: you must use the callback function instead.</p>

<p>A new instance of the application is launched for call to <code>runtime.sendNativeMessage()</code>. The browser will terminate the native application after getting a reply. To terminate a native application, the browser will close the pipe, give the process a few seconds to exit gracefully, and then kill it if it has not exited.</p>

<p>For more information, see <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging">Native messaging</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="brush:js">var sending = browser.runtime.sendNativeMessage(
  application,             // string
  message                  // object
)
</pre>

<h3 id="Parameters">Parameters</h3>

<dl>
 <dt><code>application</code></dt>
 <dd><code>string</code>. The name of the native application. This must match the "name" property in the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Native_messaging#app_manifest">native application's manifest file</a>.</dd>
 <dt><code>message</code></dt>
 <dd><code>object</code>. A JSON object that will be sent to the native application.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Return_value">Return value</h3>

<p>A <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">Promise</a></code>. If the sender sent a response, this will be fulfilled with the response as a JSON object. Otherwise it will be fulfilled with no arguments. If an error occurs while connecting to the native application, the promise will be rejected with an error message.</p>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Here's a background script that sends a "ping" message to the "ping_pong" app and logs the response, whenever the user clicks the browser action:</p>

<pre class="brush: js line-numbers">function onResponse(response) {
  console.log(`Received ${response}`);
}

function onError(error) {
  console.log(`Error: ${error}`);
}

/*
On a click on the browser action, send the app a message.
*/
browser.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(() => {
  console.log("Sending:  ping");
  var sending = browser.runtime.sendNativeMessage("ping_pong", "ping");
  sending.then(onResponse, onError);
});
</pre>
