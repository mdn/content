{{AddonSidebar()}}

An object containing information about the sender of a message or connection request; this is passed to the {{WebExtAPIRef("runtime.onMessage()")}} listener.

It is also a property of {{WebExtAPIRef("runtime.Port")}}, but only in the `Port` instance passed into the {{WebExtAPIRef("runtime.onConnect()")}} or {{WebExtAPIRef("runtime.onConnectExternal()")}} listeners.

## Type

Values of this type are objects. They contain the following properties:

- `tab`{{optional_inline}}
  - : {{WebExtAPIRef('tabs.Tab')}}. The {{WebExtAPIRef('tabs.Tab')}} which opened the connection. This property will only be present when the connection was opened from a tab (including content scripts).
- `frameId`{{optional_inline}}
  - : `integer`. The frame that opened the connection. Zero for top-level frames, positive for child frames. This will only be set when `tab` is set.
- `id`{{optional_inline}}

  - : `string`. The ID of the extension that sent the message, if the message was sent by an extension. If the sender set an ID explicitly using the [applications](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/browser_specific_settings) key in manifest.json, then `id` will have this value. Otherwise it will have the ID that was generated for the sender.

    Note that in Firefox, before version 54, this value was the extension's internal ID (that is, the [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) that appears in the extension's URL).

- `url`{{optional_inline}}

  - : `string`. The URL of the page or frame hosting the script that sent the message.

    If the sender is a script running in an extension page (such as a [background page](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Anatomy_of_a_WebExtension#background_scripts), an [options page](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Anatomy_of_a_WebExtension#options_pages), or a [browser action](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Anatomy_of_a_WebExtension#browser_actions_2) or [page action](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Anatomy_of_a_WebExtension#page_actions) popup), the URL will be in the form `"moz-extension://<extension-internal-id>/path/to/page.html"`. If the sender is a background script and you haven't included a background page, it will be `"moz-extension://<extension-internal-id>/_generated_background_page.html"`.

    \>If the sender is a script running in a web page (including content scripts as well as normal page scripts), then `url` will be the web page URL. If the script is running in an iframe, `url` will be the iframe's URL.

- `tlsChannelId`{{optional_inline}}
  - : `string`. The TLS channel ID of the page or frame that opened the connection, if requested by the extension, and if available.
