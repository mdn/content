{{AddonSidebar()}}

Make a connection between different contexts inside the extension.

You can call this:

- in an extension's content scripts, to establish a connection with the extension's background scripts (or similarly privileged scripts, like popup scripts or options page scripts).
- in an extension's background scripts (or similarly privileged scripts), to establish a connection with a different extension.

Note that you can't use this function to connect an extension to its content scripts. To do this, use {{WebExtAPIRef('tabs.connect()')}}.

## Syntax

```js
var port = browser.runtime.connect(
  extensionId, // optional string
  connectInfo  // optional object
)
```

### Parameters

- `extensionId`{{optional_inline}}
  - : `string`. The ID of the extension to connect to. If the target has set an ID explicitly using the [applications](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/browser_specific_settings) key in manifest.json, then `extensionId` should have that value. Otherwise it should have the ID that was generated for the target.
- `connectInfo`{{optional_inline}}

  - : `object`. Details of the connection:

    - `name`{{optional_inline}}
      - : `string`. Will be passed into {{WebExtAPIRef("runtime.onConnect")}} for processes that are listening for the connection event.
    - `includeTlsChannelId`{{optional_inline}}
      - : `boolean`. Whether the TLS channel ID will be passed into {{WebExtAPIRef("runtime.onConnectExternal")}} for processes that are listening for the connection event.

### Return value

{{WebExtAPIRef('runtime.Port')}}. Port through which messages can be sent and received. The port'sÂ  `onDisconnect` event is fired if the extension does not exist.

## Browser compatibility

## Examples

This content script:

- connects to the background script and stores the `Port` in a variable called `myPort`.
- listens for messages on `myPort` and logs them.
- sends messages to the background script, using `myPort`, when the user clicks the document.

```js
// content-script.js

var myPort = browser.runtime.connect({name:"port-from-cs"});
myPort.postMessage({greeting: "hello from content script"});

myPort.onMessage.addListener(function(m) {
  console.log("In content script, received message from background script: ");
  console.log(m.greeting);
});

document.body.addEventListener("click", function() {
  myPort.postMessage({greeting: "they clicked the page!"});
});
```

The corresponding background script:

- listens for connection attempts from the content script.
- when it receives a connection attempt:

  - stores the port in a variable named `portFromCS`.
  - sends the content script a message using the port.
  - starts listening to messages received on the port, and logs them.

- sends messages to the content script, using `portFromCS`, when the user clicks the extension's browser action.

```js
// background-script.js

var portFromCS;

function connected(p) {
  portFromCS = p;
  portFromCS.postMessage({greeting: "hi there content script!"});
  portFromCS.onMessage.addListener(function(m) {
    console.log("In background script, received message from content script")
    console.log(m.greeting);
  });
}

browser.runtime.onConnect.addListener(connected);

browser.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function() {
  portFromCS.postMessage({greeting: "they clicked the button!"});
});
```
