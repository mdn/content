{{AddonSidebar()}}

Fired when an add-on is uninstalled.

This API requires the "management" [API permission](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions).

## Syntax

```js
browser.management.onUninstalled.addListener(listener)
browser.management.onUninstalled.removeListener(listener)
browser.management.onUninstalled.hasListener(listener)
```

Events have three functions:

- `addListener(callback)`
  - : Adds a listener to this event.
- `removeListener(listener)`
  - : Stop listening to this event. The `listener` argument is the listener to remove.
- `hasListener(listener)`
  - : Checks whether a `listener` is registered for this event. Returns `true` if it is listening, `false` otherwise.

## addListener syntax

### Parameters

- `function`

  - : Callback function that will be called when this event occurs. The function will be passed the following argument:

    - `info`
      - : [`ExtensionInfo`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/management/ExtensionInfo): info about the add-on that was uninstalled.
