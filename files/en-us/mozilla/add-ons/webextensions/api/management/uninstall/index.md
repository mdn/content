{{AddonSidebar()}}

Uninstalls an add-on, given its ID.

This API requires the "management" [API permission](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions).

This is an asynchronous function that returns a [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise).

## Syntax

```js
var uninstalling = browser.management.uninstall(
  id,                  // string
  options              // object
)
```

### Parameters

- `id`
  - : `string`. ID of the add-on to uninstall.
- `options{{optional_inline}}`
  - : `object`. Object which may contain a single property, `showConfirmDialog`. If `showConfirmDialog` is `true`, the browser will show a dialog asking the user to confirm that the add-on should be uninstalled.

<!---->

- If `id` is the calling add-on's ID,Â `showConfirmDialog` defaults to `false`.
- If `id` is a the ID of a different add-on, the `showConfirmDialog` option is ignored and the confirmation dialog is always shown.

### Return value

A [`Promise`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) that will be rejected with an error message if the user canceled uninstall.

## Browser compatibility

{{Compat}}

## Examples

Uninstall the add-on whose ID is "my-addon-id", asking the user to confirm. In the callback, check whether the user canceled uninstallation.

Note that we haven't passed a fulfillment handler because if uninstallation succeeds, the add-on is no longer around to handle it.

```js
var id = "my-addon-id";

function onCanceled(error) {
  console.log(`Uninstall canceled: ${error}`);
}

var uninstalling = browser.management.uninstall(id);
uninstalling.then(null, onCanceled);
```
