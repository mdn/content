<p>Use the topSites API to get an array containing pages that the user has visited frequently.</p>

<p>Browsers maintain this to help the user get back to these places easily. For example, Firefox by default provides a list of the most-visited pages in the "New Tab" page.</p>

<p>To use the topSites API you must have the "topSites" <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#api_permissions">API permission</a>.</p>
