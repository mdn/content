<div>This function can be used to ensure that event listeners are applied correctly when pages are in the browser's in-memory cache.</div>


<div>If the browser has loaded a page, and the page is reloaded, the browser may reload the page from its in-memory cache, and in this case, events will not be triggered for the request.</div>

<p>Suppose an extension's job is to block web requests against a pattern, and the following scenario happens:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The user loads a page that includes a particular request, and the pattern permits the request.</li>
 <li>The resource is loaded and cached in memory.</li>
 <li>The extension's patterns are updated, in such a way that the resource would no longer be permitted.</li>
 <li>The user reloads the page.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because the page will be reloaded from the memory cache, the listener may not be called again, and the request will be loaded despite the extension's new policy.</p>

<p>The <code>handlerBehaviorChanged()</code> function is designed to address this problem. It flushes the in-memory cache, so that page reloads will trigger event listeners.</p>

<p>Because <code>handlerBehaviorChanged()</code> flushes the cache, it can be expensive and bad for performance. The webRequest module defines a read-only property {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.MAX_HANDLER_BEHAVIOR_CHANGED_CALLS_PER_10_MINUTES", "MAX_HANDLER_BEHAVIOR_CHANGED_CALLS_PER_10_MINUTES")}}: making more calls than this number in 10 minutes will have no effect.</p>

<p>The implementation of caching, hence the need for this function, varies from one browser to another, so in some browsers this function does nothing.</p>

<p>This is an asynchronous function that returns a <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">Promise</a></code>.</p>

<p>In the following snippet, we flush the in-memory cache via a call to <code>handlerBehaviorChanged()</code>,Â  and report this action by logging an appropriate message to the console.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function onFlushed() {
  console.log(`In-memory cache flushed`);
}

function onError(error) {
  console.log(`Error: ${error}`);
}

var flushingCache = browser.webRequest.handlerBehaviorChanged();
flushingCache.then(onFlushed, onError);</pre>
