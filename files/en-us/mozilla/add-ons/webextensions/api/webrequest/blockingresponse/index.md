An object of this type is returned by event listeners that have set `"blocking"` in their `extraInfoSpec` argument.

By setting particular properties in `BlockingResponse`, the listener can modify network requests.

Note that you can't set all this object's properties in every listener: the properties you can set are dependent on the event that triggered this listener, as detailed below.

## Type

Values of this type are objects. They contain the following properties:

- `authCredentials`{{optional_inline}}

  - : `object`. If set, the request is made using the given credentials. You can only set this property in {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onAuthRequired", "onAuthRequired")}}. The `authCredentials` property is an object with the following properties:

    - `username`
      - : `string`. Username to supply.
    - `password`
      - : `string`. Password to supply.

- `cancel`{{optional_inline}}
  - : `boolean`. If `true`, the request is cancelled. You can only set this property in {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onBeforeRequest", "onBeforeRequest")}}, {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders", "onBeforeSendHeaders")}}, {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onHeadersReceived", "onHeadersReceived")}}, and {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onAuthRequired", "onAuthRequired")}}.
- `redirectUrl`{{optional_inline}}

  - : `string`. This is a URL, and if set, the original request is redirected to that URL. You can only set this property in {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onBeforeRequest", "onBeforeRequest")}} or {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onHeadersReceived", "onHeadersReceived")}}.

    Redirections to non-HTTP schemes such as data: are allowed, but they are not currently supported ({{bug("707624")}}). Redirects use the same request method as the original request unless initiated from `onHeadersReceived` stage, in which case the redirect uses the GET method.

    If an extension wants to redirect a public (e.g. HTTPS) URL to an [extension page](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/user_interface/Extension_pages), the extension's manifest.json file must contain a [web_accessible_resources](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/web_accessible_resources) key that lists the URL for the extension page..

- `requestHeaders`{{optional_inline}}
  - : {{WebExtAPIRef('webRequest.HttpHeaders')}}. This is an {{WebExtAPIRef('webRequest.HttpHeaders', "HttpHeaders")}} object, an array in which each object represents a header. If set, the request is made with these headers rather than the original headers. You can only set this property in {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders", "onBeforeSendHeaders")}} .
- `responseHeaders`{{optional_inline}}
  - : {{WebExtAPIRef('webRequest.HttpHeaders')}}. This is an {{WebExtAPIRef('webRequest.HttpHeaders', "HttpHeaders")}} object, an array in which each object represents a header. If set, the server is assumed to have responded with these response headers instead of the originals. You can only set this property in {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onHeadersReceived", "onHeadersReceived")}}. If multiple extensions attempt to set the same header (for example, `Content-Security-Policy`), only one of the changes will be successful.
- `upgradeToSecure`{{optional_inline}}
  - : `boolean`. If set to `true` and the original request is an HTTP request, this will prevent the original request from being sent and instead make a secure (HTTPS) request. If any extension returns `redirectUrl` in `onBeforeRequest`, then `upgradeToSecure` will be ignored for that request. You can only set this property in {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onBeforeRequest", "onBeforeRequest")}}.
