{{AddonSidebar()}}

Fired when a server-initiated redirect is about to occur.

Note that you can't pass `"blocking"` for this event, so you can't modify or cancel the request from this event: it's informational only.

## Syntax

```js
browser.webRequest.onBeforeRedirect.addListener(
  listener,             // function
  filter,               //  object
  extraInfoSpec         //  optional array of strings
)
browser.webRequest.onBeforeRedirect.removeListener(listener)
browser.webRequest.onBeforeRedirect.hasListener(listener)
```

Events have three functions:

- `addListener(callback, filter, extraInfoSpec)`
  - : Adds a listener to this event.
- `removeListener(listener)`
  - : Stop listening to this event. The `listener` argument is the listener to remove.
- `hasListener(listener)`
  - : Check whether `listener` is registered for this event. Returns `true` if it is listening, `false` otherwise.

## addListener syntax

### Parameters

- `callback`

  - : A function that will be called when this event occurs. The function will be passed the following arguments:

    - `details`
      - : [`object`](#details). Details about the request. See [`details`](#details) below.

- `filter`
  - : {{WebExtAPIRef('webRequest.RequestFilter')}}. A filter that restricts the events that will be sent to this listener.
- `extraInfoSpec`{{optional_inline}}

  - : `array` of `string`. Extra options for the event. You can pass just one value:

    - `"responseHeaders"`: include `responseHeaders` in the `details` object passed to the listener

## Additional objects

### details

- `cookieStoreId`
  - : `string`. If the request is from a tab open in a contextual identity, the cookie store ID of the contextual identity.
- `documentUrl`
  - : `string`. URL of the document in which the resource will be loaded. For example, if the web page at "https\://example.com" contains an image or an iframe, then the `documentUrl` for the image or iframe will be "https\://example.com". For a top-level document, `documentUrl` is undefined.
- `frameId`
  - : `integer`. Zero if the request happens in the main frame; a positive value is the ID of a subframe in which the request happens. If the document of a (sub-)frame is loaded (`type` is `main_frame` or `sub_frame`), `frameId` indicates the ID of this frame, not the ID of the outer frame. Frame IDs are unique within a tab.
- `fromCache`
  - : `boolean`. Indicates if this response was fetched from disk cache.
- `incognito`
  - : `boolean`. Whether the request is from a private browsing window.
- `ip`
  - : `string`. The IP address of the server the request was sent to. It may be a literal IPv6 address.
- `method`
  - : `string`. Standard HTTP method: for example, "GET" or "POST".
- `originUrl`

  - : `string`. URL of the resource which triggered the request. For example, if "https\://example.com" contains a link, and the user clicks the link, then the `originUrl` for the resulting request is "https\://example.com".

    The `originUrl` is often but not always the same as the `documentUrl`. For example, if a page contains an iframe, and the iframe contains a link that loads a new document into the iframe, then the `documentUrl` for the resulting request will be the iframe's parent document, but the `originUrl` will be the URL of the document in the iframe that contained the link.

- `parentFrameId`
  - : `integer`. ID of the frame that contains the frame which sent the request. Set to -1 if no parent frame exists.
- `proxyInfo`

  - : `object`. This property is present only if the request is being proxied. It contains the following properties:

    - `host`
      - : `string`. The hostname of the proxy server.
    - `port`
      - : `integer`. The port number of the proxy server.
    - `type`

      - : `string`. The type of proxy server. One of:

        - "http": HTTP proxy (or SSL CONNECT for HTTPS)
        - "https": HTTP proxying over TLS connection to proxy
        - "socks": SOCKS v5 proxy
        - "socks4": SOCKS v4 proxy
        - "direct": no proxy
        - "unknown": unknown proxy

    - `username`
      - : `string`. Username for the proxy service.
    - `proxyDNS`
      - : `boolean`. True if the proxy will perform domain name resolution based on the hostname supplied, meaning that the client should not do its own DNS lookup.
    - `failoverTimeout`
      - : `integer`. Failover timeout in seconds. If the proxy connection fails, the proxy will not be used again for this period.

- `redirectUrl`
  - : `string`. The new URL.
- `requestId`
  - : `string`. The ID of the request. Request IDs are unique within a browser session, so you can use them to relate different events associated with the same request.
- `responseHeaders`
  - : {{WebExtAPIRef('webRequest.HttpHeaders')}}. The HTTP response headers that were received along with this redirect.
- `statusCode`
  - : `integer`. Standard HTTP status code returned by the server.
- `statusLine`
  - : `string`. HTTP status line of the response or the 'HTTP/0.9 200 OK' string for HTTP/0.9 responses (i.e., responses that lack a status line) or an empty string if there are no headers.
- `tabId`
  - : `integer`. The ID of the tab in which the request takes place. Set to -1 if the request isn't related to a tab.
- `thirdParty`
  - : `boolean`. Indicates whether the request and its content window hierarchy are third party.
- `timeStamp`
  - : `number`. The time when this event fired, in [milliseconds since the epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).
- `type`
  - : {{WebExtAPIRef('webRequest.ResourceType')}}. The type of resource being requested: for example, "image", "script", "stylesheet".
- `url`
  - : `string`. Target of the request.
- `urlClassification`

  - : `object`. The type of tracking associated with the request, if with the request has been classified by [Firefox Tracking Protection](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop). This is an object with the following properties:

    - `firstParty`
      - : `array` of `strings`. Classification flags for the request's first party.
    - `thirdParty`
      - : `array` of `strings`. Classification flags for the request or its window hierarchy's third parties.

    The classification flags include:

    - `fingerprinting` and `fingerprinting_content`: indicates the request is involved in fingerprinting. `fingerprinting_content` indicates the request is loaded from an origin that has been found to fingerprint but is not considered to participate in tracking, such as a payment provider.
    - `cryptomining` and `cryptomining_content`: similar to the fingerprinting category but for cryptomining resources.
    - `tracking`, `tracking_ad`, `tracking_analytics`, `tracking_social`,  and `tracking_content`: indicates the request is involved in tracking. `tracking` is any generic tracking request, the `ad`, `analytics`, `social`, and `content` suffixes identify the type of tracker.
    - `any_basic_tracking`: a meta flag that combines any tracking and fingerprinting flags, excluding `tracking_content` and `fingerprinting_content`.
    - `any_strict_tracking`: a meta flag that combines any tracking and fingerprinting flags, including `tracking_content` and `fingerprinting_content`.
    - `any_social_tracking`: a meta flag that combines any social tracking flags.
