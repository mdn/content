Add event listeners for the various stages of making an HTTP request, which includes websocket requests on `ws://` and `wss://`. The event listener receives detailed information about the request and can modify or cancel the request.

Each event is fired at a particular stage of the request. The typical sequence of events is like this:

![](webrequest-flow.png)

{{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onErrorOccurred", "onErrorOccurred")}} can be fired at any time during the request. Also, note that sometimes the sequence of events may differ from this: for example, in Firefox, on an [HSTS](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Strict-Transport-Security) upgrade, the `onBeforeRedirect` event will be triggered immediately after `onBeforeRequest`.

All events—_except_ `onErrorOccurred`—can take three arguments to `addListener()`:

- the listener itself
- a {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.RequestFilter", "filter")}} object, so you can only be notified for requests made to particular URLs or for particular types of resource
- an optional `extraInfoSpec` object. You can use this to pass additional event-specific instructions.

The listener function is passed a `details` object containing information about the request. This includes a request ID, which is provided to enable an add-on to correlate events associated with a single request. It is unique within a browser session and the add-on's context. It stays the same throughout a request, even across redirections and authentication exchanges.

To use the `webRequest` API for a given host, an extension must have the `"webRequest"` [API permission](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#api_permissions) and the [host permission ](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#host_permissions)for that host. To use the `"blocking"` feature, the extension must also have the `"webRequestBlocking"` API permission.

To intercept resources loaded by a page (such as images, scripts, or stylesheets), the extension must have the host permission for the resource as well as for the main page requesting the resource. For example, if a page at `https://developer.mozilla.org` loads an image from `https://mdn.mozillademos.org`, then an extension must have both host permissions if it is to intercept the image request.

## Modifying requests

On some of these events, you can modify the request. Specifically, you can:

- cancel the request in:

  - {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onBeforeRequest", "onBeforeRequest")}}
  - {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders", "onBeforeSendHeaders")}}
  - {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onAuthRequired", "onAuthRequired")}}

- redirect the request in:

  - {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onBeforeRequest", "onBeforeRequest")}}
  - {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onHeadersReceived", "onHeadersReceived")}}

- modify request headers in:

  - {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders", "onBeforeSendHeaders")}}

- modify response headers in:

  - {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onHeadersReceived", "onHeadersReceived")}}

- supply authentication credentials in:

  - {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onAuthRequired", "onAuthRequired")}}

To do this, you need to pass an option with the value `"blocking"` in the `extraInfoSpec` argument to the event's `addListener()`. This makes the listener synchronous.

In the listener, you can then return a {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.BlockingResponse", "BlockingResponse")}} object, which indicates the modification you need to make: for example, the modified request header you want to send.

## Accessing security information

In the {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onHeadersReceived", "onHeadersReceived")}} listener you can access the [TLS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) properties of a request by calling {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.getSecurityInfo()", "getSecurityInfo()")}}. To do this you must also pass "blocking" in the `extraInfoSpec` argument to the event's `addListener()`.

You can read details of the TLS handshake, but can't modify them or override the browser's trust decisions.

## Modifying responses

To modify the HTTP response bodies for a request, call {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.filterResponseData")}}, passing it the ID of the request. This returns a {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.StreamFilter")}} object that you can use to examine and modify the data as it is received by the browser.

To do this, you must have the `"webRequestBlocking"` API permission as well as the `"webRequest"` [API permission](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#api_permissions) and the [host permission ](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#host_permissions)for the relevant host.

## Types

- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.BlockingResponse")}}
  - : An object of this type is returned by event listeners that have set `"blocking"` in their `extraInfoSpec` argument. By setting particular properties in `BlockingResponse`, the listener can modify network requests.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.CertificateInfo")}}
  - : An object describing a single X.509 certificate.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.HttpHeaders")}}
  - : An array of HTTP headers. Each header is represented as an object with two properties: `name` and either `value` or `binaryValue`.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.RequestFilter")}}
  - : An object describing filters to apply to `webRequest` events.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.ResourceType")}}
  - : Represents a particular kind of resource fetched in a web request.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.SecurityInfo")}}
  - : An object describing the security properties of a particular web request.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.StreamFilter")}}
  - : An object that can be used to monitor and modify HTTP responses while they are being received.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.UploadData")}}
  - : Contains data uploaded in a URL request.

## Properties

- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.MAX_HANDLER_BEHAVIOR_CHANGED_CALLS_PER_10_MINUTES", "webRequest.MAX_HANDLER_BEHAVIOR_CHANGED_CALLS_PER_10_MINUTES")}}
  - : The maximum number of times that {{WebExtAPIRef("WebRequest.handlerBehaviorChanged", "handlerBehaviorChanged()")}} can be called in a 10 minute period.

## Methods

- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.handlerBehaviorChanged()")}}
  - : This method can be used to ensure that event listeners are applied correctly when pages are in the browser's in-memory cache.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.filterResponseData()")}}
  - : Returns a {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.StreamFilter")}} object for a given request.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.getSecurityInfo()")}}
  - : Gets detailed information about the [TLS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLS) connection associated with a given request.

## Events

- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onBeforeRequest")}}
  - : Fired when a request is about to be made, and before headers are available. This is a good place to listen if you want to cancel or redirect the request.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders")}}
  - : Fired before sending any HTTP data, but after HTTP headers are available. This is a good place to listen if you want to modify HTTP request headers.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onSendHeaders")}}
  - : Fired just before sending headers. If your add-on or some other add-on modified headers in `{{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onBeforeSendHeaders", "onBeforeSendHeaders")}}`, you'll see the modified version here.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onHeadersReceived")}}
  - : Fired when the HTTP response headers associated with a request have been received. You can use this event to modify HTTP response headers.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onAuthRequired")}}
  - : Fired when the server asks the client to provide authentication credentials. The listener can do nothing, cancel the request, or supply authentication credentials.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onResponseStarted")}}
  - : Fired when the first byte of the response body is received. For HTTP requests, this means that the status line and response headers are available.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onBeforeRedirect")}}
  - : Fired when a server-initiated redirect is about to occur.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onCompleted")}}
  - : Fired when a request is completed.
- {{WebExtAPIRef("webRequest.onErrorOccurred")}}
  - : Fired when an error occurs.
