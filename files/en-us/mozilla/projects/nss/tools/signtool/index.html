Description<br>
<br>
   The Signing Tool, signtool, creates digital signatures and uses a Java<br>
   Archive (JAR) file to associate the signatures with files in a directory.<br>
   Electronic software distribution over any network involves potential<br>
   security problems. To help address some of these problems, you can<br>
   associate digital signatures with the files in a JAR archive. Digital<br>
   signatures allow SSL-enabled clients to perform two important operations:<br>
<br>
   * Confirm the identity of the individual, company, or other entity whose<br>
   digital signature is associated with the files<br>
<br>
   * Check whether the files have been tampered with since being signed<br>
<br>
   If you have a signing certificate, you can use Netscape Signing Tool to<br>
   digitally sign files and package them as a JAR file. An object-signing<br>
   certificate is a special kind of certificate that allows you to associate<br>
   your digital signature with one or more files.<br>
<br>
   An individual file can potentially be signed with multiple digital<br>
   signatures. For example, a commercial software developer might sign the<br>
   files that constitute a software product to prove that the files are<br>
   indeed from a particular company. A network administrator manager might<br>
   sign the same files with an additional digital signature based on a<br>
   company-generated certificate to indicate that the product is approved for<br>
   use within the company.<br>
<br>
   The significance of a digital signature is comparable to the significance<br>
   of a handwritten signature. Once you have signed a file, it is difficult<br>
   to claim later that you didn't sign it. In some situations, a digital<br>
   signature may be considered as legally binding as a handwritten signature.<br>
   Therefore, you should take great care to ensure that you can stand behind<br>
   any file you sign and distribute.<br>
<br>
   For example, if you are a software developer, you should test your code to<br>
   make sure it is virus-free before signing it. Similarly, if you are a<br>
   network administrator, you should make sure, before signing any code, that<br>
   it comes from a reliable source and will run correctly with the software<br>
   installed on the machines to which you are distributing it.<br>
<br>
   Before you can use Netscape Signing Tool to sign files, you must have an<br>
   object-signing certificate, which is a special certificate whose<br>
   associated private key is used to create digital signatures. For testing<br>
   purposes only, you can create an object-signing certificate with Netscape<br>
   Signing Tool 1.3. When testing is finished and you are ready to<br>
   disitribute your software, you should obtain an object-signing certificate<br>
   from one of two kinds of sources:<br>
<br>
   * An independent certificate authority (CA) that authenticates your<br>
   identity and charges you a fee. You typically get a certificate from an<br>
   independent CA if you want to sign software that will be distributed over<br>
   the Internet.<br>
<br>
   * CA server software running on your corporate intranet or extranet.<br>
   Netscape Certificate Management System provides a complete management<br>
   solution for creating, deploying, and managing certificates, including CAs<br>
   that issue object-signing certificates.<br>
<br>
   You must also have a certificate for the CA that issues your signing<br>
   certificate before you can sign files. If the certificate authority's<br>
   certificate isn't already installed in your copy of Communicator, you<br>
   typically install it by clicking the appropriate link on the certificate<br>
   authority's web site, for example on the page from which you initiated<br>
   enrollment for your signing certificate. This is the case for some test<br>
   certificates, as well as certificates issued by Netscape Certificate<br>
   Management System: you must download the CA certificate in addition to<br>
   obtaining your own signing certificate. CA certificates for several<br>
   certificate authorities are preinstalled in the Communicator certificate<br>
   database.<br>
<br>
   When you receive an object-signing certificate for your own use, it is<br>
   automatically installed in your copy of the Communicator client software.<br>
   Communicator supports the public-key cryptography standard known as PKCS<br>
   #12, which governs key portability. You can, for example, move an<br>
   object-signing certificate and its associated private key from one<br>
   computer to another on a credit-card-sized device called a smart card.<br>
<br>
Options<br>
<br>
   -b basename<br>
<br>
           Specifies the base filename for the .rsa and .sf files in the<br>
           META-INF directory to conform with the JAR format. For example, -b<br>
           signatures causes the files to be named signatures.rsa and<br>
           signatures.sf. The default is signtool.<br>
<br>
   -c#<br>
<br>
           Specifies the compression level for the -J or -Z option. The<br>
           symbol # represents a number from 0 to 9, where 0 means no<br>
           compression and 9 means maximum compression. The higher the level<br>
           of compression, the smaller the output but the longer the<br>
           operation takes. If the -c# option is not used with either the -J<br>
           or the -Z option, the default compression value used by both the<br>
           -J and -Z options is 6.<br>
<br>
   -d certdir<br>
<br>
           Specifies your certificate database directory; that is, the<br>
           directory in which you placed your key3.db and cert7.db files. To<br>
           specify the current directory, use "-d." (including the period).<br>
           The Unix version of signtool assumes ~/.netscape unless told<br>
           otherwise. The NT version of signtool always requires the use of<br>
           the -d option to specify where the database files are located.<br>
<br>
   -e extension<br>
<br>
           Tells signtool to sign only files with the given extension; for<br>
           example, use -e".class" to sign only Java class files. Note that<br>
           with Netscape Signing Tool version 1.1 and later this option can<br>
           appear multiple times on one command line, making it possible to<br>
           specify multiple file types or classes to include.<br>
<br>
   -f commandfile<br>
<br>
           Specifies a text file containing Netscape Signing Tool options and<br>
           arguments in keyword=value format. All options and arguments can<br>
           be expressed through this file. For more information about the<br>
           syntax used with this file, see "Tips and Techniques".<br>
<br>
   -i scriptname<br>
<br>
           Specifies the name of an installer script for SmartUpdate. This<br>
           script installs files from the JAR archive in the local system<br>
           after SmartUpdate has validated the digital signature. For more<br>
           details, see the description of -m that follows. The -i option<br>
           provides a straightforward way to provide this information if you<br>
           don't need to specify any metadata other than an installer script.<br>
<br>
   -j directory<br>
<br>
           Specifies a special JavaScript directory. This option causes the<br>
           specified directory to be signed and tags its entries as inline<br>
           JavaScript. This special type of entry does not have to appear in<br>
           the JAR file itself. Instead, it is located in the HTML page<br>
           containing the inline scripts. When you use signtool -v, these<br>
           entries are displayed with the string NOT PRESENT.<br>
<br>
   -k key ... directory<br>
<br>
           Specifies the nickname (key) of the certificate you want to sign<br>
           with and signs the files in the specified directory. The directory<br>
           to sign is always specified as the last command-line argument.<br>
           Thus, it is possible to write signtool -k MyCert -d . signdir You<br>
           may have trouble if the nickname contains a single quotation mark.<br>
           To avoid problems, escape the quotation mark using the escape<br>
           conventions for your platform. It's also possible to use the -k<br>
           option without signing any files or specifying a directory. For<br>
           example, you can use it with the -l option to get detailed<br>
           information about a particular signing certificate.<br>
<br>
   -G nickname<br>
<br>
           Generates a new private-public key pair and corresponding<br>
           object-signing certificate with the given nickname. The newly<br>
           generated keys and certificate are installed into the key and<br>
           certificate databases in the directory specified by the -d option.<br>
           With the NT version of Netscape Signing Tool, you must use the -d<br>
           option with the -G option. With the Unix version of Netscape<br>
           Signing Tool, omitting the -d option causes the tool to install<br>
           the keys and certificate in the Communicator key and certificate<br>
           databases. If you are installing the keys and certificate in the<br>
           Communicator databases, you must exit Communicator before using<br>
           this option; otherwise, you risk corrupting the databases. In all<br>
           cases, the certificate is also output to a file named x509.cacert,<br>
           which has the MIME-type application/x-x509-ca-cert. Unlike<br>
           certificates normally used to sign finished code to be distributed<br>
           over a network, a test certificate created with -G is not signed<br>
           by a recognized certificate authority. Instead, it is self-signed.<br>
           In addition, a single test signing certificate functions as both<br>
           an object-signing certificate and a CA. When you are using it to<br>
           sign objects, it behaves like an object-signing certificate. When<br>
           it is imported into browser software such as Communicator, it<br>
           behaves like an object-signing CA and cannot be used to sign<br>
           objects. The -G option is available in Netscape Signing Tool 1.0<br>
           and later versions only. By default, it produces only RSA<br>
           certificates with 1024-byte keys in the internal token. However,<br>
           you can use the -s option specify the required key size and the -t<br>
           option to specify the token. For more information about the use of<br>
           the -G option, see "Generating Test Object-Signing<br>
           Certificates""Generating Test Object-Signing Certificates" on page<br>
           1241.<br>
<br>
   -l<br>
<br>
           Lists signing certificates, including issuing CAs. If any of your<br>
           certificates are expired or invalid, the list will so specify.<br>
           This option can be used with the -k option to list detailed<br>
           information about a particular signing certificate. The -l option<br>
           is available in Netscape Signing Tool 1.0 and later versions only.<br>
<br>
   -J<br>
<br>
           Signs a directory of HTML files containing JavaScript and creates<br>
           as many archive files as are specified in the HTML tags. Even if<br>
           signtool creates more than one archive file, you need to supply<br>
           the key database password only once. The -J option is available<br>
           only in Netscape Signing Tool 1.0 and later versions. The -J<br>
           option cannot be used at the same time as the -Z option. If the<br>
           -c# option is not used with the -J option, the default compression<br>
           value is 6. Note that versions 1.1 and later of Netscape Signing<br>
           Tool correctly recognizes the CODEBASE attribute, allows paths to<br>
           be expressed for the CLASS and SRC attributes instead of filenames<br>
           only, processes LINK tags and parses HTML correctly, and offers<br>
           clearer error messages.<br>
<br>
   -L<br>
<br>
           Lists the certificates in your database. An asterisk appears to<br>
           the left of the nickname for any certificate that can be used to<br>
           sign objects with signtool.<br>
<br>
   --leavearc<br>
<br>
           Retains the temporary .arc (archive) directories that the -J<br>
           option creates. These directories are automatically erased by<br>
           default. Retaining the temporary directories can be an aid to<br>
           debugging.<br>
<br>
   -m metafile<br>
<br>
           Specifies the name of a metadata control file. Metadata is signed<br>
           information attached either to the JAR archive itself or to files<br>
           within the archive. This metadata can be any ASCII string, but is<br>
           used mainly for specifying an installer script. The metadata file<br>
           contains one entry per line, each with three fields: field #1:<br>
           file specification, or + if you want to specify global metadata<br>
           (that is, metadata about the JAR archive itself or all entries in<br>
           the archive) field #2: the name of the data you are specifying;<br>
           for example: Install-Script field #3: data corresponding to the<br>
           name in field #2 For example, the -i option uses the equivalent of<br>
           this line: + Install-Script: script.js This example associates a<br>
           MIME type with a file: movie.qt MIME-Type: video/quicktime For<br>
           information about the way installer script information appears in<br>
           the manifest file for a JAR archive, see The JAR Format on<br>
           Netscape DevEdge.<br>
<br>
   -M<br>
<br>
           Lists the PKCS #11 modules available to signtool, including smart<br>
           cards. The -M option is available in Netscape Signing Tool 1.0 and<br>
           later versions only. For information on using Netscape Signing<br>
           Tool with smart cards, see "Using Netscape Signing Tool with Smart<br>
           Cards". For information on using the -M option to verify<br>
           FIPS-140-1 validated mode, see "Netscape Signing Tool and<br>
           FIPS-140-1".<br>
<br>
   --norecurse<br>
<br>
           Blocks recursion into subdirectories when signing a directory's<br>
           contents or when parsing HTML.<br>
<br>
   -o<br>
<br>
           Optimizes the archive for size. Use this only if you are signing<br>
           very large archives containing hundreds of files. This option<br>
           makes the manifest files (required by the JAR format) considerably<br>
           smaller, but they contain slightly less information.<br>
<br>
   --outfile outputfile<br>
<br>
           Specifies a file to receive redirected output from Netscape<br>
           Signing Tool.<br>
<br>
   -p password<br>
<br>
           Specifies a password for the private-key database. Note that the<br>
           password entered on the command line is displayed as plain text.<br>
<br>
   -s keysize<br>
<br>
           Specifies the size of the key for generated certificate. Use the<br>
           -M option to find out what tokens are available. The -s option can<br>
           be used with the -G option only.<br>
<br>
   -t token<br>
<br>
           Specifies which available token should generate the key and<br>
           receive the certificate. Use the -M option to find out what tokens<br>
           are available. The -t option can be used with the -G option only.<br>
<br>
   -v archive<br>
<br>
           Displays the contents of an archive and verifies the cryptographic<br>
           integrity of the digital signatures it contains and the files with<br>
           which they are associated. This includes checking that the<br>
           certificate for the issuer of the object-signing certificate is<br>
           listed in the certificate database, that the CA's digital<br>
           signature on the object-signing certificate is valid, that the<br>
           relevant certificates have not expired, and so on.<br>
<br>
   --verbosity value<br>
<br>
           Sets the quantity of information Netscape Signing Tool generates<br>
           in operation. A value of 0 (zero) is the default and gives full<br>
           information. A value of -1 suppresses most messages, but not error<br>
           messages.<br>
<br>
   -w archive<br>
<br>
           Displays the names of signers of any files in the archive.<br>
<br>
   -x directory<br>
<br>
           Excludes the specified directory from signing. Note that with<br>
           Netscape Signing Tool version 1.1 and later this option can appear<br>
           multiple times on one command line, making it possible to specify<br>
           several particular directories to exclude.<br>
<br>
   -z<br>
<br>
           Tells signtool not to store the signing time in the digital<br>
           signature. This option is useful if you want the expiration date<br>
           of the signature checked against the current date and time rather<br>
           than the time the files were signed.<br>
<br>
   -Z jarfile<br>
<br>
           Creates a JAR file with the specified name. You must specify this<br>
           option if you want signtool to create the JAR file; it does not do<br>
           so automatically. If you don't specify -Z, you must use an<br>
           external ZIP tool to create the JAR file. The -Z option cannot be<br>
           used at the same time as the -J option. If the -c# option is not<br>
           used with the -Z option, the default compression value is 6.<br>
<br>
The Command File Format<br>
<br>
   Entries in a Netscape Signing Tool command file have this general format:<br>
   keyword=value Everything before the = sign on a single line is a keyword,<br>
   and everything from the = sign to the end of line is a value. The value<br>
   may include = signs; only the first = sign on a line is interpreted. Blank<br>
   lines are ignored, but white space on a line with keywords and values is<br>
   assumed to be part of the keyword (if it comes before the equal sign) or<br>
   part of the value (if it comes after the first equal sign). Keywords are<br>
   case insensitive, values are generally case sensitive. Since the = sign<br>
   and newline delimit the value, it should not be quoted.<br>

   Using Netscape Signing Tool with a ZIP Utility<br>
<br>
   To use Netscape Signing Tool with a ZIP utility, you must have the utility<br>
   in your path environment variable. You should use the zip.exe utility<br>
   rather than pkzip.exe, which cannot handle long filenames. You can use a<br>
   ZIP utility instead of the -Z option to package a signed archive into a<br>
   JAR file after you have signed it:<br>
<br>
 cd signdir<br>
<br>
   zip -r ../myjar.jar *<br>
   adding: META-INF/ (stored 0%)<br>

   Generating the Keys and Certificate<br>
<br>
   The signtool option -G generates a new public-private key pair and<br>
   certificate. It takes the nickname of the new certificate as an argument.<br>
   The newly generated keys and certificate are installed into the key and<br>
   certificate databases in the directory specified by the -d option. With<br>
   the NT version of Netscape Signing Tool, you must use the -d option with<br>
   the -G option. With the Unix version of Netscape Signing Tool, omitting<br>
   the -d option causes the tool to install the keys and certificate in the<br>
   Communicator key and certificate databases. In all cases, the certificate<br>
   is also output to a file named x509.cacert, which has the MIME-type<br>
   application/x-x509-ca-cert.<br>
<br>
   Certificates contain standard information about the entity they identify,<br>
   such as the common name and organization name. Netscape Signing Tool<br>
   prompts you for this information when you run the command with the -G<br>
   option. However, all of the requested fields are optional for test<br>
   certificates. If you do not enter a common name, the tool provides a<br>
   default name. In the following example, the user input is in boldface:<br>
<br>
 signtool -G MyTestCert<br>
<br>
 using certificate directory: /u/someuser/.netscape<br>
 Enter certificate information. All fields are optional. Acceptable<br>
 characters are numbers, letters, spaces, and apostrophes.<br>
 certificate common name: Test Object Signing Certificate<br>
 organization: Netscape Communications Corp.<br>
 organization unit: Server Products Division<br>
 state or province: California<br>
 country (must be exactly 2 characters): US<br>
 username: someuser<br>
 email address: <a class=" link-mailto" href="mailto:someuser@netscape.com">someuser@netscape.com</a><br>
 Enter Password or Pin for "Communicator Certificate DB": [Password will not echo]<br>
 generated public/private key pair<br>
 certificate request generated<br>
 certificate has been signed<br>
 certificate "MyTestCert" added to database<br>
 Exported certificate to x509.raw and x509.cacert.<br>
<br>
   The certificate information is read from standard input. Therefore, the<br>
   information can be read from a file using the redirection operator (&lt;) in<br>
   some operating systems. To create a file for this purpose, enter each of<br>
   the seven input fields, in order, on a separate line. Make sure there is a<br>
   newline character at the end of the last line. Then run signtool with<br>
   standard input redirected from your file as follows:<br>
<br>
 signtool -G MyTestCert inputfile<br>
<br>
   The prompts show up on the screen, but the responses will be automatically<br>
   read from the file. The password will still be read from the console<br>
   unless you use the -p option to give the password on the command line.<br>
<br>
   Using the -M Option to List Smart Cards<br>
<br>
   You can use the -M option to list the PKCS #11 modules, including smart<br>
   cards, that are available to signtool:<br>
<br>
 signtool -d "c:\netscape\users\jsmith" -M<br>
<br>
 using certificate directory: c:\netscape\users\username<br>

   Using Netscape Signing Tool and a Smart Card to Sign Files<br>
<br>
   The signtool command normally takes an argument of the -k option to<br>
   specify a signing certificate. To sign with a smart card, you supply only<br>
   the fully qualified name of the certificate.<br>
<br>
   To see fully qualified certificate names when you run Communicator, click<br>
   the Security button in Navigator, then click Yours under Certificates in<br>
   the left frame. Fully qualified names are of the format smart<br>
   card:certificate, for example "MyCard:My Signing Cert". You use this name<br>
   with the -k argument as follows:<br>
<br>
 signtool -k "MyCard:My Signing Cert" directory<br>
<br>
   Verifying FIPS Mode<br>
<br>
   Use the -M option to verify that you are using the FIPS-140-1 module.<br>
<br>
 signtool -d "c:\netscape\users\jsmith" -M<br>
<br>
 using certificate directory: c:\netscape\users\jsmith<br>
