<h3 id="New_Functionality">New Functionality</h3>

<p>No new functionality is introduced in this release. This is a patch release to fix a bug that caused NSS to accept forged RSA signatures.</p>

<p>A new symbol, _SGN_VerifyPKCS1DigestInfo is exported in this release. As with all exported NSS symbols that have a leading underscore '_', this is an internal symbol for NSS use only. Applications that use or depend on these symbols can and will break in future NSS releases.</p>

<h3 id="Acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>

<p>The NSS development team would like to thank Antoine Delignat-Lavaud, security researcher at Inria Paris in team Prosecco, and the Advanced Threat Research team at Intel Security, who both independently discovered and reported this issue, for responsibly disclosing the issue by providing advance copies of their research.</p>

<h2 id="Compatibility">Compatibility</h2>

<p>NSS 3.16.5 shared libraries are backward compatible with all older NSS 3.x shared libraries. A program linked with older NSS 3.x shared libraries will work with NSS 3.16.5 shared libraries without recompiling or relinking. Furthermore, applications that restrict their use of NSS APIs to the functions listed in NSS Public Functions will remain compatible with future versions of the NSS shared libraries.</p>
