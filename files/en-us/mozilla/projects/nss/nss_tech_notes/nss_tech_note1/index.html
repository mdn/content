<h2 id="How_to_use_the_NSS_ASN.1_and_QuickDER_decoders"> How to use the NSS ASN.1 and QuickDER decoders</h2>

<h3 id="NSS_Technical_Note_1"> NSS Technical Note: 1</h3>
NSS 3.6 contains several decoders
for ASN.1 and DER.Two of them are extensively used and are part of the
public NSS API :
<ol>
  <li> The "classic" ASN.1 decoder, written by Lisa Repka . This was
    written to be a generic decoder, that includes both DER (Distinguished
    Encoding Rules) and BER (Basic Encoding Rules).† It handles both
    streaming and non-streaming input.</li>
  <li> The "QuickDER" decoder, written by Julien Pierre for NSS 3.6 .
    This decoder was written when performance issues were discovered with
    the classic decoder. It can only decode DER .† It does not handle
    streaming input, and requires that all input be present before beginning
    to decode.</li>
</ol>
Despite their differences, the two
decoders have a lot in common. QuickDER was written to be as compatible
as possible with the classic decoder, in order to ease migration to it
in areas of critical performance bottlenecks. For this reason, I will
first describe all the common functionality of the two decoders, before
outlining their differences.
<p>The main non-streaming APIs for these
  two decoders have an identical prototype : </p>
<ul>
  <li> SECStatus SEC_ASN1DecodeItem(PRArenaPool
    *pool, void *dest, const SEC_ASN1Template *t, SECItem *item);</li>
  <li> SECStatus
    SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem(PRArenaPool* arena, void* dest, const
    SEC_ASN1Template* templateEntry, SECItem* src);</li>
</ul>
Here is a description of the
arguments :
<ul>
  <li> <u>SECItem* src</u>† is a structure containing a
    pointer to the binary data to be decoded, as well as its size.</li>
  <li> <u>const SEC_ASN1Template* templateEntry</u> is a
    pointer to one or more <a href="#templates">decoder templates</a>. The
    number of required templates is determined by the type of the first
    template.When multiple templates are required, the pointer must point to
    a NULL-terminated array of templates. The syntax of these templates is
    identical for both decoders, except where noted. A "NULL Template" is a template
    that is all zeros, having a zero kind.† The term "NULL-terminated
    array", as used throughout this document, means an array of templates,
    the last of which is a NULL template.</li>
  <li> <u>void* dest</u> is a pointer to the target area. This
    is where the decoder stores its output. The type is undefined as it is
    completely dependent on the content of the decoder templates.† This
    typically points to a struct that is described (or partially described)
    by the templates.</li>
  <li> <u>PRArenaPool* arena</u> is a pointer to an NSPR arena
    pool. This is the arena pool from which the decoder will allocate memory
    as needed.</li>
</ul>
<a id="Templates"></a><span style="color: rgb(0,0,0); text-decoration: underline;">Decoder
  templates :</span><br>
<br>
The SEC_ASN1Template structure tells the decoder what to do with the
input data. This structure contains four fields :
<ul>
  <li> <u>kind</u> . This 32-bit field tells the decoder what
    to do with a particular component within the input data. It is made of
    two parts : the lower byte, which can contain <a href="#asn.1_tags">ASN.1
      tags</a>, and the upper 3 bytes, which can contain <a href="#decoder_modifiers">decoder modifiers</a>. If only an
    ASN.1 tag
    is specified without a modifier, then the decoder will enforce the
    presence of a component of that type, and fail if it does not match. If
    kind is an ASN.1 SEQUENCE tag (SEC_ASN1_SEQUENCE),
    then you must specify additional templates in a NULL-terminated array to
    define the content of the of the ASN.1 SEQUENCE. If kind is
    the SEC_ASN1_CHOICE modifier, you must also specify additional
    templates in a NULL terminated array to list the various possible types
    that this component can have. In all other cases, only the first
    template structure passed to the decoder will be considered, even if
    additonal templates are passed in an array. When only one template is
    needed, you do not need a NULL template to terminate the array.</li>
  <li> <u>offset</u>† . This field does not apply to all
    template types. It is only needed if the template instructs the decoder
    to save some data, such as for primitive component types, or for some
    modifiers where noted.When needed, it tells the decoder where in the
    target data to save the current component. It is normally relative to
    the dest argument passed to the decoder. If templates are
    nested, the offset applies to the location of the current component
    within the target component, typically the decoded SEQUENCE.</li>
  <li> <u>sub</u>† . This field does not apply to all
    template types. If kind contains the SEC_ASN1_INLINE
    or SEC_ASN1_POINTER modifiers, then it must point to the
    required subtemplate. If kind contains the SEC_ASN1_XTRN
    or SEC_ASN1_DYNAMIC modifiers, this is a pointer to a callback
    function that will dynamically return the required subtemplate.</li>
  <li> <u>size</u>† . This field does not apply to all
    template types. It is only required for dynamically allocating memory
    for the structure if the template is being included from an ASN.1 SEQUENCE
    or SEQUENCE OF, or if dynamic allocation was requested from
    the parent template using the SEC_ASN1_POINTER modifier</li>
</ul>
Here is a description of the various
tags and modifiers that apply to the kind
field.
<p><u><a id="ASN.1_tags"></a>ASN.1 tags</u> </p>
<p>ASN.1 tags are specified in the lower
  byte of the kind field of the template, as noted above. <br>
  The following is not an attempt to explain ASN.1 tags or their
  purposes. Rather, the goal here is to explain what type of tags the
  decoder supports and which macros should be used when defining tags in
  decoder templates. It should be noted that we only support an older
  specification of ASN.1; multibyte tags are not currently supported. </p>
<p>The 8-bit ASN.1 tags that we support
  are made of three parts : </p>
<ol>
  <li> The ASN.1 component
    class type. It is specified in the upper 2 tag bits (number 6 and 7).
    There are four classes of ASN.1 tags : universal, application-specific,
    context-specific, and private. You can specify the class of the tag
    using the macros SEC_ASN1_UNIVERSAL, SEC_ASN1_APPLICATION,
    SEC_ASN1_CONTEXT_SPECIFIC and SEC_ASN1_PRIVATE. Universal
    is the default tag class and does not have to be specified, as the value
    of the class type is zero.</li>
  <li> The method type : whether the component type is constructed or
    primitive. This information is stored in the next lowest tag bit (number
    5). You can use the macro SEC_ASN1_CONSTRUCTED for a
    constructed component type. A SEC_ASN1_PRIMITIVE macro is also
    provided, but does not need to be included as it is zero.</li>
  <li> The tag number. It is stored in the lower 5 tag bits (number 0
    through 4). The ASN.1 standard only defines tag numbers in the universal
    class. If you are using a tag of a different classes, you can define
    your own tag number macros or specify the tag value within the template
    definition. The following macros are provided for tag numbers within
    the universal class :
    <br>
    SEC_ASN1_BOOLEAN, SEC_ASN1_INTEGER, SEC_ASN1_BIT_STRING,
    SEC_ASN1_OCTET_STRING, SEC_ASN1_NULL, SEC_ASN1_OBJECT_ID,
    SEC_ASN1_OBJECT_DESCRIPTOR,† SEC_ASN1_REAL, SEC_ASN1_ENUMERATED,
    SEC_ASN1_EMBEDDED_PDV, SEC_ASN1_UTF8_STRING, SEC_ASN1_SEQUENCE,
    SEC_ASN1_SET, SEC_ASN1_NUMERIC_STRING, SEC_ASN1_PRINTABLE_STRING,
    SEC_ASN1_T61_STRING, SEC_ASN1_TELETEX_STRING, SEC_ASN1_T61_STRING,
    SEC_ASN1_VIDEOTEX_STRING, SEC_ASN1_IA5_STRING, SEC_ASN1_UTC_TIME,
    SEC_ASN1_GENERALIZED_TIME, SEC_ASN1_GRAPHIC_STRING,
    SEC_ASN1_VISIBLE_STRING, SEC_ASN1_GENERAL_STRING,
    SEC_ASN1_UNIVERSAL_STRING, SEC_ASN1_BMP_STRING
    <p>Note that for SEC_ASN1_SET and SEC_ASN1_SEQUENCE
      types, you must also include the method type macro SEC_ASN1_CONSTRUCTED
      to construct a fully valid tag, as defined by the ASN.1 standard .</p>
  </li>
</ol>
<u><a name="decoder_modifiers"></a>Decoder
  modifiers :</u>
<p>These modifiers are also specified in
  the kind field of the template structure. All the values are in
  the 9 - 31 bit range. </p>
<ul>
  <li> <u>SEC_ASN1_OPTIONAL</u>: tells the decoder that this
    component is optional. If the component in the input data does not match
    this template, the decoder will continue processing the input data using
    the next available template.</li>
  <li> <u>SEC_ASN1_EXPLICIT</u>: tells the decoder that
    explicit tagging is being used. This is always a constructed type. It
    requires a subtemplate defining the types of the data within.</li>
  <li> <u>SEC_ASN1_ANY</u>: allows the decoder to match this
    template with any component type, regardless of the tag in the input
    data. If used in conjunction with SEC_ASN1_OPTIONAL as part of
    a sequence, this must be the last template in the template array.</li>
  <li> <u>SEC_ASN1_INLINE</u>: recurse into the specified
    subtemplate to continue processing. This is typically used for SEC_ASN1_SEQUENCE
    or SEC_ASN1_CHOICE definitions, which always need to be the
    first template in a template array of their own.</li>
  <li> <u>SEC_ASN1_POINTER</u>: similar to SEC_ASN1_INLINE,
    except that the memory in the
    target will be allocated dynamically
    and a pointer to the dynamically allocated memory will be stored in the <i>dest</i>
    struct at the <i>offset</i>. This requires that the subtemplate
    contains a non-zero size field.</li>
  <li> <u>SEC_ASN1_GROUP</u>: can only be used in conjunction
    with a SEC_ASN1_SET or SEC_ASN1_SEQUENCE. It tells
    the decoder that the component is an ASN.1 SET OF or SEQUENCE
    OF respectively. You can also use the macros SEC_ASN1_SET_OF
    and SEC_ASN1_SEQUENCE_OF which define both the tag number and
    this modifier (but still need the method type, this may be a bug).</li>
  <li> <u>SEC_ASN1_DYNAMIC</u> or <u>SEC_ASN1_XTRN</u>
    : specifies that the component format is defined in a dynamic
    subtemplate. There is no difference between the two macros. The sub
    field of the template points to a callback function of type SEC_ASN1TemplateChooser
    that returns the subtemplate depending on the component data.</li>
  <li> <u>SEC_ASN1_SKIP</u>: specifies that the decoder should
    skip decoding of the component. SEC_ASN1DecodeItem can only
    skip required components and will assert if you try to skip an OPTIONAL
    component. SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem supports skipping the
    decoding of OPTIONAL components if you define the tag of the
    component in the template</li>
  <li> <u>SEC_ASN1_INNER</u>: recurse into the component and
    saves its content, without the surrounding ASN.1 tag and length</li>
  <li> <u>SEC_ASN1_SAVE</u>: saves the component data, but
    does not proceed to the next component if within a SEQUENCE
    template array. This means the next template will reprocess the same
    component.</li>
  <li> <u>SEC_ASN1_SKIP_REST</u>: abort the decoding. This is
    used in a template array within a SEQUENCE, if you don't care
    about the fields at the end of it. SEC_ASN1DecodeItem only
    supports this modifier in the top-level template. SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem
    allows it at any nested sublevel.</li>
  <li> <u>SEC_ASN1_CHOICE</u>: allows decoding of components
    that are of variable type. This must be the first template in a
    NULL-terminated array. The offset parameter specifies where to
    store the type identifier in the target data . Subsequent templates
    specify a custom identifier for each possible component type in the size
    parameter .</li>
  <li> <u>SEC_ASN1_DEBUG_BREAK</u>: makes the decoder assert
    when processing the template. This option is only supported with SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem
    . It is useful to debug your templates or when writing new templates if
    they don't work.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
  <u>Differences between SEC_ASN1DecodeItem and SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem</u>
</p>
<ol>
  <li> The arena argument is required to be non-NULL
    for SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem . With SEC_ASN1DecodeItem,
    it can be NULL, and if so, the decoder will allocate from the
    heap using PR_Malloc . However, this usage is strongly
    discouraged and we recommend that you always use an arena pool even with SEC_ASN1DecodeItem.
    See <a href="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=175163">bug
      175163</a> for more information about the reason for this recommendation.</li>
  <li> SEC_ASN1DecodeItem will make a copy of the input data
    into the decoded target as needed, while SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem
    will generate output with pointers into the input. This means that if
    you use SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem, you must always be careful not
    to free the input as long as you intend to use the decoded structure.
    Ideally, you should allocate the input data out of the same arena that
    you are passing to the decoder. This will allow you to free both the
    input data and the decoded data at once when freeing the arena.</li>
  <li> SEC_ASN1DecodeItem can decode both BER and DER data,
    while SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem can only decode DER data.</li>
  <li> SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem does not support streaming data.
    This feature will most likely never be added, as this decoder gets most
    of its extra speed from not making a copy of the input data, which would
    be required when streaming.</li>
  <li> SEC_QuickDERDecodeItem supports SEC_ASN1_OPTIONAL
    together with SEC_ASN1_SKIP</li>
  <li> SEC_ASN1_DEBUG_BREAK is not supported by SEC_ASN1DecodeItem</li>
</ol>
