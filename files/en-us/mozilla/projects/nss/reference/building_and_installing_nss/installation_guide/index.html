<p>The build system of NSS originated from Netscape's build system,
which predated the "configure; make; make test; make install"
sequence that we're familiar with now. Our makefiles also have
an "install" target, but it has a different meaning: our "install"
means installing the headers, libraries, and programs in the
appropriate directories under mozilla/dist.
</p><p>So right now you need to manually install the headers, libraries,
and programs in the directories you want. If you install the
libraries in a directory other than /usr/lib, you usually need
to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. You can avoid
that by installing the libraries in a directory that is
$ORIGIN/../lib, where $ORIGIN is the directory where the programs
are installed. This is done here:

</p>
<pre class="eval">53 ifeq ($(OS_ARCH), Linux)
54 ifeq ($(USE_64), 1)
55 EXTRA_SHARED_LIBS += -Wl,-rpath,'$$ORIGIN/../lib64:$$ORIGIN/../lib'
56 else
57 EXTRA_SHARED_LIBS += -Wl,-rpath,'$$ORIGIN/../lib'
58 endif
59 endif
</pre>
<p>For example, if you install certutil in /foo/bar/nss/bin and the
.so's in /foo/bar/nss/lib, then you only need to add /foo/bar/nss/bin
to your PATH; you don't need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
</p><p>The libraries you need to install are listed below.

ones)
