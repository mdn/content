<h2 id="Bugs_fixed_in_NSS_3.28.3">Bugs fixed in NSS 3.28.3</h2>

<p>NSS version 3.28, 3.28.1 and 3.28.2 contained changes that were in violation with the NSS compatibility promise.</p>

<p>ECParams, which is part of the public API of the freebl/softokn parts of NSS, had been changed to include an additional attribute. That size increase caused crashes or malfunctioning with applications that use that data structure directly, or indirectly through ECPublicKey, ECPrivateKey, NSSLOWKEYPublicKey, NSSLOWKEYPrivateKey, or potentially other data structures that reference ECParams. The change has been reverted to the original state in <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1334108">bug 1334108</a>.</p>

<p>SECKEYECPublicKey had been extended with a new attribute, named "encoding". If an application passed type SECKEYECPublicKey to NSS (as part of SECKEYPublicKey), the NSS library read the uninitialized attribute. With this NSS release SECKEYECPublicKey.encoding is deprecated. NSS no longer reads the attribute, and will always set it to ECPoint_Undefined. See <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1340103">bug 1340103</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Compatibility">Compatibility</h2>

<p>NSS 3.28.3 shared libraries are backward compatible with most older NSS 3.x shared libraries, but depending on your application, may be incompatible, if you application has been compiled against header files of versions 3.28, 3.28.1, or 3.28.2.</p>

<p>A program linked with most older NSS 3.x shared libraries (excluding the exceptions mentioned above), will work with NSS 3.28.3 shared libraries without recompiling or relinking. Furthermore, applications that restrict their use of NSS APIs to the functions listed in NSS Public Functions will remain compatible with future versions of the NSS shared libraries.</p>

<p>If you had compiled your application against header files of NSS 3.28, NSS 3.28.1 or NSS 3.28.2, it is recommended that you recompile your application against NSS 3.28.3, at the time you upgrade to NSS 3.28.3.</p>

<p>Please note that NSS 3.29 also contained the incorrect change. You should avoid using NSS 3.29, and rather use NSS 3.29.1 or a newer version. See also the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS/NSS_3.29.1_release_notes">separate release notes for NSS 3.29.1</a></p>
