<h3 id="Results_link"> Results link </h3>
<ul><li> <a class="link-ftp" href="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/security/nss/coverage/20070814-sparc/nss.html">2007-08-14 - Solaris/Sparc platform</a>
</li></ul>
<h3 id="Results_explanation"> Results explanation </h3>
<h4 id="Files"> Files </h4>
<ul><li> Results from every C file are on new line.
</li><li> If file was tested, link points to annotated source file (in TCOV directory), otherwise to original source file (CVS directory).
</li></ul>
<h4 id="Colors"> Colors </h4>
<ul><li> Green: 70-100% of blocks tested.
</li><li> Yellow: 40-70% of blocks tested.
</li><li> Orange: 0-40% of blocks tested.
</li><li> Red: file not tested. File is not part of any binary or library used by test suite. </li></ul>
<h4 id="Numbers_in_tested_files"> Numbers in tested files </h4>
<ul><li> Example: 72.69% (165/227/731)
<ul><li> 72.69% - ratio of tested blocks and total blocks in file (generated by TCOV).
</li><li> 165 - tested blocks in file (generated by TCOV).
</li><li> 227 - total blocks in file (generated by TCOV).
</li><li> 31 - total lines in file (by wc -l command).
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h4 id="Numbers_in_not_tested_files"> Numbers in not tested files </h4>
<ul><li> Example: Not tested (0/?/878).
<ul><li> 0 - tested blocks in file (always 0).
</li><li>Â ? - total blocks in file (there is no trivial method to get this number without TCOV).
</li><li> 878 - total lines in file (by wc -l command).
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<h4 id="Numbers_in_total_count"> Numbers in total count </h4>
<ul><li> Example: Total: 42% (574/1351).
<ul><li> 42% - ratio of tested blocks and total blocks in file.
</li><li> 165 - tested blocks in all files in directory (sum of numbers generated by TCOV).
</li><li> 227 - total blocks in all files in directory (sum of numbers generated by TCOV).
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul><li> These numbers doesn't count blocks in files which are not tested (marked with red color), because we don't know number of blocks there.
</li><li> Total count at the end of report counts blocks in all tested files in all directories.
</li></ul>
