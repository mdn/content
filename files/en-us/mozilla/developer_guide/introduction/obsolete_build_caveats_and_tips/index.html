<h2 id="Purpose_of_this_page">Purpose of this page</h2>

<p>The Mozilla build process and code base have evolved considerably over the past few years. This has resulted in many caveats and tips being added to the MDN documentation for building older versions of the code base or dealing with older build tools. These tips, while helpful, are jarring and superfluous to the majority of new Mozilla builders who are mainly interested in building the latest version of Firefox. Therefore, instead of deleting all these nuggets of information, it's best to collect them all here and remove them from the majority happy path documentation. Each piece of information should mention the page and the section it originally came from. You can copy in the original text and bold out what has been removed.</p>

<p>These versions are <strong>not supported</strong> and the Windows 7 SDK will not work with them. You need to upgrade to one of the newer Visual C++ versions above.</p>


<p><strong>For Gecko 11 or below</strong>: you could also download the <a href="#windows_vista_sdk">Windows Vista SDK</a> and follow the instructions there to allow you to build against it.</p>


<div class="note">
<p>Starting with {{Gecko ("12.0")}}, this SDK is necessary.</p>
</div>


<p><strong>Note:</strong> While this configuration will probably build on mozilla-1.9.1 and mozilla-1.9.0, it is not supported.</p>


<div class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Due to a bug in old versions of MozillaBuild (prior to 1.6), if you download version 7.1 of the Windows 7 SDK (which is the current version available), your build <strong>will</strong> fail, often while building cairo with "ocidl.h" errors. In order to fix this issue, you need to use the latest version of MozillaBuild.</div>

<h2 id="Windows_Vista_SDK">Windows Vista SDK</h2>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This SDK is not used since {{Gecko("12.0")}}.
</div>

<p>This is the SDK that mozilla-1.9.1 (Firefox 3.5) builds used to be built against. Features that depend on this SDK include:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Windows Vista parental controls</li>
 <li>File associations and application registration on Vista and above</li>
 <li>Ability to display the UAC shield icon in the UI</li>
 <li>Thunderbird Windows Search integration</li>
 <li>Text Services Framework support</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two ways to obtain it:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Download the <a class="external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=4377F86D-C913-4B5C-B87E-EF72E5B4E065&amp;displaylang=en">Windows Vista SDK</a> from the Microsoft Download Center.

  <ul>
   <li>You may choose not to install the Sample Code and Documentation to save space and download time.</li>
   <li>If you are using Windows XP, you must have <a class="external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/sp2/default.mspx" rel="external nofollow">Windows XP Service Pack 2</a> and <a class="external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/info.aspx?na=47&amp;p=3&amp;SrcDisplayLang=en&amp;SrcCategoryId=&amp;SrcFamilyId=4377f86d-c913-4b5c-b87e-ef72e5b4e065&amp;u=details.aspx?familyid=0856EACB-4362-4B0D-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5&amp;displaylang=en" rel="external nofollow">.NET Framework 2.0</a> installed before installing the Vista SDK.</li>

<p><strong>Gecko 1.9.2 through 11:</strong> If you would like to use this SDK, add <code>ac_add_options --with-windows-version=600</code> to your .mozconfig.</p>

<h2 id="Windows_Server_2003_R2_Platform_SDK">Windows Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK</h2>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This SDK is not used since {{Gecko("12.0")}}.
</div>

<p>This is your only option if you're on Windows 2000. This also used to be necessary for building a default <strong>Gecko 1.9.2 through 8</strong> with Visual C++ Express editions (see <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/atlbase.h" title="atlbase.h">atlbase.h</a> for more).</p>

<p>You can <a class="external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0baf2b35-c656-4969-ace8-e4c0c0716adb&amp;displaylang=en">download the SDK</a> from the Microsoft Download Center.</p>

<ul>
 <li>You need to install at least the "Windows Core SDK", "Web Workshop (IE) SDK", and the "Data Access Services (MDAC) SDK".</li>
 <li>For all SDKs, you may choose not to install Sample Code and Documentation to save space and download time.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Gecko 1.9.2 through 11:</strong> If you're building with this SDK, you will need to add <code>ac_add_options --with-windows-version=502</code> to your .mozconfig.</p>

<div class="note">For mozilla-1.9.1 and mozilla-1.9.0, you need to add <code>ac_add_options --disable-vista-sdk-requirements</code> to your .mozconfig instead.</div>

<h2 id="Unsupported_SDKs">Unsupported SDKs</h2>

<p>The Windows SDK for Windows Server 2008 is not supported, and has been found to cause the following problems:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Breaks the vcvars32.bat file from Visual Studio 2008</li>
 <li>No longer sets the correct PATH for the .NET framework</li>
 <li>Causes an invalid PATH which breaks the Mozilla build</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you have the Windows Server 2008 SDK installed, uninstall it. The SDK will break builds even if you try to use other SDKs.</strong></p>

<p>Other possible workarounds:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Use another SDK (the one shipped with Visual Studio 9).</li>
 <li>Delete the vcvars32.bat file and repair your Visual Studio installation with the setup program.</li>
 <li>Edit vcvars32.bat to correct the problem (see <a class="external" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/windowssdk/archive/2008/04/18/installing-win-sdk-for-svr-2008-after-vs-2008-breaks-vs-command-line-build-environment.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/windowssdk/arc...vironment.aspx</a> "Workaround: Repair the VS2008 command line build environment by editing c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\VC\bin\vcvars32.bat manually").</li>
</ul>

<p>SDKs older than the Server 2003 R2 Platform SDK aren't supported either.</p>

<h3 id="Microsoft_Visual_C_(MSVC)">Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC)</h3>

<p>Depending on what you're building, you will need to use one of several available versions of Microsoft Visual C++ (MSVC) and/or Microsoft Visual Studio. See the chart at the top of this page to ensure that the version you've selected is compatible with the branch you want to build.</p>

<div class="warning">If you want to enable jemalloc, you must be using Visual Studio 2012, Visual Studio 2010 SP1, Visual Studio 2010, Visual Studio 2008 SP1, or <a class="external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=bb4a75ab-e2d4-4c96-b39d-37baf6b5b1dc&amp;displaylang=en">Visual Studio 2005 SP1</a>.

You do not need to install the Silverlight runtime or the SQL Server 2008 Express Edition when offered. Alternatively you can install the command-line compiler as part of the Windows 7 SDK, but you are then expected to use the included WinDbg debugger.</li>
 <li>The Visual C++ 8 command-line compiler is included with the Vista SDK, but you are then expected to use the included WinDbg debugger.</li>
</ul>


<p>From <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Configuring_Build_Options">Configuring Build Options [en-US]</a></p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Starting with {{Gecko ("5.0")}}, building Firefox has become extremely simple. The default application is now Firefox, so you can build Firefox by doing <code>configure &amp;&amp; make</code> (for standalone source tarballs) or <code>make -f client.mk</code> (for code from the Mercurial repository); this will build something roughly the same as the shipped version of Firefox corresponding to the code you have. You only need to follow the steps below if you want to customize the build (e.g., to create a debug build or a release build with debug symbols), you want to build something other than Firefox, or you want to build pre-gecko 5.0 source.</p>
</div>

<p>If you are building Mozilla source code from before Firefox 5, then you <strong>must</strong> first select the Mozilla application that you want to build (see below), and you will probably <em>also</em> need to set at least <em>some</em> of the other basic configuration options (such as whether to build a debug build or not) to get the type of build that you need.</p>


<p>If you are building from an older project branch that still uses CVS, you will need to set MOZ_CO_PROJECT to the appropriate value or values, using a comma-separated list, such as "<code>mk_add_options MOZ_CO_PROJECT=browser,mail,calendar,suite,xulrunner</code>".  This setting is ignored by most Mozilla project branches, which now use mercurial instead of CVS for source control.</p>


<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Starting in {{Gecko ("2.0")}}, objdir builds are enabled by default.  If you do not specify a MOZ_OBJDIR it will be automatically set to @TOPSRCDIR@/obj-@CONFIG_GUESS@</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can run <code>client.mk</code> directly from your objdir, using <code>make -f &lt;path_to_srcdir&gt;/client.mk.</code></p>
</div>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Starting in {{Gecko ("5.0")}}, if you don't specify an application, <code>--enable-application=browser</code> is assumed, thereby building Firefox.</p>
</div>
