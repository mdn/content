<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Starting in {{Gecko("9.0")}}, <code>atlbase.h</code> is no longer needed, since support for ActiveX has been removed.</p>

<p><code>atlbase.h</code> is a header file which is provided by the Microsoft Active Template Library.</p>

<p>The error "System header atlbase.h is not available" indicates that you do not have a copy of ATL in your INCLUDE directory. There are several ways you can solve this problem:</p>

<h4 id="Use_the_Professional_Version_of_Microsoft_Visual_C.2B.2B">Use the Professional Version of Microsoft Visual C++</h4>

<p>The professional version of Microsoft Visual C++ comes with ATL headers.</p>

<h4 id="Use_the_Windows_2003_SDK">Use the Windows 2003 SDK</h4>

<p>The Windows 2003 SDK is a <a class="external" href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=0BAF2B35-C656-4969-ACE8-E4C0C0716ADB&amp;displaylang=en">free download</a> and is the last version of the Windows SDK to come with ATL headers.</p>

<p>NOTE: The Windows 2008 SDK, which the 2003 SDKÂ page points you to, doesn't have the ATL headers.</p>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Unfortunately, the Windows 7 SDK is required to build Mozilla normally, because of dependencies on Vista and Windows 7-specific APIs. MozillaBuild 1.4 and above will allow you to use both the Windows 7 SDK and an older Platform SDK to work around this issue.</div>

<p>You should restart <code>start-msvcX.bat</code> after installing the Windows 2003 SDK.</p>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you encounter an error that <code>atlbase.h</code> cannot be found and you have installed Visual Studio 10 Express together with the platform SDK, you may have to delete a registry entry so that <code>guess-msvc.bat</code> doesn't detect VC10 installed. The key is <code>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\Setup\VC</code>.</div>

<h4 id="Disable_code_that_uses_ATL">Disable code that uses ATL</h4>

<p>ATL is used by only a small portion of our codebase. You should be able to disable these features and do a build without ATL. To disable ATL, add the line below to the <code>.mozconfig</code> file. On Windows XP, this may be located in <code>C:\Documents and Settings\(your user name)</code>. If the file does not exist, create it.</p>

<pre class="eval">ac_add_options --disable-accessibility</pre>

<pre class="eval">ac_add_options --disable-xpconnect-idispatch
</pre>

<pre class="eval">ac_add_options --disable-activex
</pre>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Note that xpconnect-idispatch and ActiveX features (that are off by default) rely on <code>atlbase.h</code> as well, so you should not turn those on unless <code>atlbase.h</code> is present.</div>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Some versions of <code>atlbase.h</code> add <code>atlthunk.lib</code> to the list of default libraries. The mozillabuild environment provides a compatible version of <code>atlthunk.lib</code> for you.</div>
