<div class="note">
<p>This page covers the steps needed to build a bleeding-edge, development version of <strong>Firefox for Desktop</strong> or <strong>Firefox for Android</strong> using pre-built binary artifacts.  Welcome, we're delighted to see you! :)<br>
 <br>
 If you're having trouble following this documentation or hit a roadblock you can't get around, please contact Nick Alexander at <a class="link-mailto" href="mailto:nalexander@mozilla.com" rel="freelink">nalexander@mozilla.com</a> directly so we can solve the problem for you and every new contributor after you.</p>

<h2 id="Artifact_builds">Artifact builds</h2>

<p>Firefox for Desktop and Android supports a <strong>fast build mode</strong> called <em>artifact mode</em>.  The resulting builds are called <em>artifact builds</em>.  (Some mobile team managers call it <em>manager mode </em>since it's particularly helpful if you only write code infrequently.)  <em>Artifact mode</em> downloads pre-built C++ components rather than building them locally, trading bandwidth for time.</p>

<p>Artifact builds will be useful to many developers who are not working with compiled code (see "Restrictions" below). Artifacts are typically fetched from <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/fx-team/">fx-team</a>, <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/integration/mozilla-inbound/">mozilla-inbound</a>, or <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/">mozilla-central</a>.</p>

<p>To automatically download and use pre-built binary artifacts, add the following lines into your <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Configuring_Build_Options#Using_a_.mozconfig_Configuration_File">mozconfig</a> file:</p>

<pre class="notranslate"># Automatically download and use compiled C++ components:
ac_add_options --enable-artifact-builds

# Write build artifacts to:
mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=./objdir-frontend</pre>

<p>To automatically download and use the debug version of the pre-built binary artifact (currently supported for Linux, OSX and Windows artifacts), add <code>ac_add_options --enable-debug</code> to your mozconfig file (with artifact builds option already enabled):</p>

<pre class="notranslate"># Enable debug versions of the pre-built binary artifacts:
ac_add_options --enable-debug

# Automatically download and use compiled C++ components:
ac_add_options --enable-artifact-builds

# Download debug info so that stack traces refers to file and columns rather than library and Hex address
<code>ac_add_options --enable-artifact-build-symbols</code>

# Write build artifacts to:
mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=./objdir-frontend-debug-artifact</pre>

<h2 id="Prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>

<p>Artifact builds are supported for users of Mercurial and Git. Git artifact builds require a mozilla-central clone made with the help of <a href="https://github.com/glandium/git-cinnabar">git-cinnabar</a>. Please follow the instructions on the git-cinnabar project page to install git-cinnabar. Further information about using git-cinnabar to interact with Mozilla repositories can be found on <a href="https://github.com/glandium/git-cinnabar/wiki/Mozilla:-A-git-workflow-for-Gecko-development">the project wiki</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Building">Building</h2>

<p>If you've added <code>--enable-artifact-builds</code> to your <code>mozconfig</code>, each time you run <code>mach build</code> and <code>mach build path/to/subdirectory</code> the build system will determine what the best pre-built binary artifacts available are, download them, and put them in place for you.  The computations are cached, so the additional calculations should be very fast after the up-to-date artifacts are downloaded -- just a second or two on modern hardware.  Most Desktop developers should find that</p>

<pre class="notranslate">./mach build
./mach run</pre>

<p>just works. </p>

<p>To only rebuild local changes (to avoid re-checking for pushes and/or unzipping the downloaded cached artifacts after local commits), you can use:</p>

<pre class="notranslate">./mach build faster
</pre>

<p>which only "builds" local JS, CSS and packaged (e.g. images and other asset) files.</p>

<p>Most Firefox for Android developers should find that</p>

<pre class="notranslate">./mach build
./mach package
./mach install</pre>

<p>just works.</p>

<h3 id="Pulling_artifacts_from_a_try_build">Pulling artifacts from a try build</h3>

<p>To only accept artifacts from a specific revision (such as a try build), set <code>MOZ_ARTIFACT_REVISION</code> in your environment to the value of the revision that is at the head of the desired push. Note that this will override the default behavior of finding a recent candidate build with the required artifacts, and will cause builds to fail if the specified revision does not contain the required artifacts.</p>

<h2 id="Restrictions">Restrictions</h2>

<p>Oh, so many.  Artifact builds are rather delicate: any mismatch between your local source directory and the downloaded binary artifacts can result in difficult to diagnose incompatibilities, including unexplained crashes and catastrophic XPCOM initialization and registration failures.  These are rare, but do happen.</p>

<h3 id="Things_that_are_supported">Things that are supported</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Modifying JavaScript, (X)HTML, and CSS resources; and string properties and DTD files.</li>
 <li>Modifying Android Java code, resources, and strings.</li>
 <li>Running mochitests and xpcshell tests.</li>
 <li>Modifying <code>Scalars.yaml</code> to add Scalar Telemetry (since {{ Bug("1425909") }}, except artifact builds on try).</li>
 <li>Modifying <code>Events.yaml</code> to add Event Telemetry (since {{ Bug("1448945") }}, except artifact builds on try).</li>
</ul>

<p>Essentially everything updated by <code>mach build faster</code> should work with artifact builds.</p>

<h3 id="Things_that_are_not_supported">Things that are not supported</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Support for products other than Firefox for Desktop and Firefox for Android is not maintained. Other projects like Thunderbird may provide <a href="https://developer.thunderbird.net/thunderbird-development/building-thunderbird/artifact-builds">their own support</a> for artifact builds.</li>
 <li>You cannot modify C, C++, or Rust source code anywhere in the tree.  If it’s compiled to machine code, it can't be changed.</li>
 <li>You cannot modify <code>histograms.json</code> to add Telemetry histogram definitions.  (But see {{ Bug("1206117") }}.).</li>
 <li>Modifying build system configuration and definitions does not work in all situations.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Things_that_are_not_yet_supported">Things that are not <strong>yet</strong> supported</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Tests other than mochitests, xpcshell, and Marionette-based tests. There aren’t inherent barriers here, but these are not known to work.</li>
 <li>Modifying WebIDL definitions, even ones implemented in JavaScript.  We don’t really know if there are barriers to making this work, and would appreciate somebody trying it and documenting the results.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>There are two parts to artifact mode: the <code>--disable-compile-environment</code> option, and the <code>mach artifact</code> command that implements the downloading and caching.  Start by running</p>

<pre class="notranslate">./mach artifact install --verbose</pre>

<p>to see what the build system is trying to do.  There is some support for querying and printing the cache; run <code>mach artifact</code> to see information about those commands.</p>

<p>Downloaded artifacts are stored in <code>$MOZBUILD_STATE_PATH/package-frontend</code>, which is almost always <code>~/.mozbuild/package-frontend</code>.</p>

<p>Discussion is best started on the <a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-builds">dev-builds mailing list</a>.  Questions are best raised in #build on <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC">IRC</a>.  Please file bugs in <em>Firefox Build System :: General</em>, blocking {{ Bug("901840") }}.</p>
