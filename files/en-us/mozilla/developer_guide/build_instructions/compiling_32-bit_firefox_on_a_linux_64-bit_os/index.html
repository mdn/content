<p>First ensure that your compiler toolchain and Gecko build dependencies are installed.</p>

<p>Then you need to use a .mozconfig that looks like the following example.</p>

<pre class="brush: bash"># Flags set for targeting x86.
export CROSS_COMPILE=1
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/pkgconfig

CC="ccache gcc -m32"
CXX="ccache g++ -m32"
AR=ar
ac_add_options --target=i686-pc-linux

# Normal build flags.  These make a debug browser build.
ac_add_options --enable-application=browser
mk_add_options MOZ_MAKE_FLAGS="-s -j6"
mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/../ff-dbg

ac_add_options --enable-debug
ac_add_options --disable-optimize

<h3 id="Instructions_for_Ubuntu_18.10">Instructions for Ubuntu 18.10</h3>

<div class="warning">
<p>WARNING: Although Ubuntu and other Debian-derived distributions support multiarch packages these days, there are still cases where packages are broken, or where the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of a package conflict. This makes it difficult to impossible to have a 32-bit development environment co-exist with a 64-bit development environment. <strong>So it is recommended to follow these instructions in a separate virtual machine!</strong></p>
</div>

<p>These steps were verified to work as of December 2018:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Set up a new virtual machine running Ubuntu 18.10.</li>
 <li>Install python with <code>sudo apt install python</code>.</li>
 <li>Install mercurial or git and fetch a copy of mozilla-central.</li>
 <li>Run <code>./mach bootstrap</code> to install some dependencies. Note that this will install some amd64 packages that are not needed to build 32-bit Firefox.</li>
 <li>Run <code>rustup target install i686-unknown-linux-gnu</code> to install the 32-bit Rust target.</li>
 <li>Install 32-bit dependencies with the following command (this may uninstall some unneeded/conflicting packages that were installed by mach bootstrap):
<pre class="notranslate brush: js">sudo apt install gcc-multilib g++-multilib libdbus-glib-1-dev:i386 \
  libgtk2.0-dev:i386 libgtk-3-dev:i386 libpango1.0-dev:i386 libxt-dev:i386</pre></li>
 <li>Create a <code>.mozconfig</code> file containing at least the following:
<pre class="notranslate brush: js">ac_add_options --target=i686-pc-linux

CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -march=pentium-m -msse -msse2 -mfpmath=sse"
CXXFLAGS="$CXXFLAGS -march=pentium-m -msse -msse2 -mfpmath=sse"

export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/pkgconfig
</pre>
 </li>
 <li>Run <code>./mach build</code>.</li>
</ol>


<h3 id="Older_generic_instructions_for_Ubuntu">Older, generic instructions for Ubuntu</h3>


<h4 id="Method_1_True_Cross-Compiling">Method 1: True Cross-Compiling</h4>

<p>This method is actually cross-compiling: you take a 64-bit toolchain and produce 32-bit binaries. This is ideally how you cross-compile.</p>

<ol>
 <li><code>sudo apt-get install ia32-libs gcc-multilib g++-multilib lib32*</code></li>
 <li>(I had to open Synaptic afterwards, search for package names beginning with lib32, and install the ones that apt-get missed)</li>
 <li>Use a <code>.mozconfig</code> like below.</li>
 <li><code>make -f client.mk build</code></li>
</ol>

<pre>export CROSS_COMPILE=1
mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/objdir-ff-dbg32
mk_add_options MOZ_MAKE_FLAGS="-s -j4"
ac_add_options --enable-application=browser

CC="gcc -m32"
CXX="g++ -m32"
AR=ar
ac_add_options --x-libraries=/usr/lib32
ac_add_options --target=i686-pc-linux

ac_add_options --disable-crashreporter # needed because I couldn't find a 32-bit curl-dev lib
ac_add_options --disable-libnotify     # needed because I couldn't find a 32-bit libinotify-dev
ac_add_options --disable-gnomevfs      # needed because I couldn't find a 32-bit libgnomevfs-dev
ac_add_options --disable-gstreamer     # needed because I couldn't find a 32-bit gstreamer lib
</pre>

<p>If you are getting an error as follows:</p>

<pre>error: Can't find header fontconfig/fcfreetype.h</pre>

<p>Add these configuration options to your <code>.mozconfig</code>:</p>

<pre>ac_add_options --disable-freetypetest
ac_add_options --disable-pango</pre>

<h4 id="Method_2_Create_a_32-bit_chroot_Environment">Method 2: Create a 32-bit chroot Environment</h4>

<p>In this method, we effectively create a wholly-contained 32-bit operating system within a 64-bit operating system using <code>schroot</code>. This isn't technically cross-compiling, but it yields the same result: 32-bit binaries.</p>

<p>This method is arguably more reliable than true cross-compiling because the newly-created environment is completely isolated from the 64-bit operating system and it won't be susceptible to common issues with cross-compiling, such as unavailability of 32-bit libraries/packages when running in 64-bit mode. Additionally, since your 32-bit environment is completely isolated, to clean up from it, you just <code>rm -rf</code> the chroot directory. Contrast this with removing dozens of 32-bit packages from your primary operating system.</p>

<p>The downside to this method is size and complexity. Since you will be effectively creating a whole operating system within your primary operating system, there will be lots of redundant files. You'll probably need at least 1GB for all the new files. Additionally, the steps for initially creating the 32-bit environment are more involved. See the bottom of this page for a script capable of automating the whole process of cross-compilation.</p>

<p>To create a 32-bit chroot Ubuntu environment, follow the <a class="link-https" href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebootstrapChroot">DebootstrapChroot</a> instructions. Here is an example config file which works in Ubuntu 13.10:</p>

<pre># /etc/schroot/chroot.d/saucy_i386

[saucy_i386]
description=Ubuntu 13.10 for i386
directory=/srv/chroot/saucy_i386
root-users=gps
type=directory
personality=linux32
users=gps
</pre>

<p>Once you have changed the <code>root-users</code> and <code>users</code> entries to include your username and verified that <code>$ schroot -c saucy_i386</code> works, <code>$ exit</code> back to your regular operating system and copy your APT's sources list to the new environment:</p>

<pre>$ sudo cp /etc/apt/sources.list /srv/chroot/saucy_i386/etc/apt/sources.list
</pre>

<p><strong>Note: this assumes a generic sources list. If you have modified this file yourself, you may wish to ensure the contents are accurate when you perform the copy.</strong></p>

<p>The reason we copy the APT sources is because <code>debootstrap </code>does not appear to configure all the sources by default (it doesn't define the "sources" sources, for example).</p>

<p>Once your sources list is copied over, enter your new environment and configure things:</p>

<pre># Update the APT sources and install sudo into the new environment and exit back out
$ schroot -c saucy_i386 -u root
(precise_i386) # apt-get update
(precise_i386) # apt-get install sudo
(precise_i386) # exit

# re-enter the environment as a regular user
$ schroot -c saucy_i386

# Install Firefox build dependencies
$ sudo apt-get build-dep firefox
</pre>

<p>Now, your new 32-bit operating system should be ready for building Firefox!</p>

<p>One last step is ensuring that <code>configure </code>detects the proper system type. Since you are technically running on a 64-bit kernel, things could still be fooled.<br>
  Run the following program from your mozilla source tree:</p>

<pre>$ ./build/autoconf/config.guess
</pre>

<p><strong>If this prints anything with <code>x86_64</code>, the system type is being incorrectly detected and you must override it.</strong> You can fix things by adding the following to your <code>mozconfig</code>:</p>

<pre>ac_add_options --host=i686-pc-linux-gnu
ac_add_options --target=i686-pc-linux-gnu
</pre>

<p>When you run configure (<code>$ mach configure</code>), verify that the host, target, and build system types are what you just defined in your <code>mozconfig</code>:</p>

<pre>checking host system type... i686-pc-linux-gnu
checking target system type... i686-pc-linux-gnu
checking build system type... i686-pc-linux-gnu
</pre>

<p>If you intend to run the 32bits Firefox build in the chroot on the 64bits machine, you need to install a few packages in the host:</p>

<pre>sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib g++-multilib libxrender1:i386 libasound-dev:i386 libdbus-glib-1-2:i386 libgtk2.0-0:i386 libxt-dev:i386</pre>

<p>Now, follow the <a href="/en-US/Developer_Guide/Build_Instructions" title="Build Instructions">build instructions</a> like normal and you should have 32-bit builds!</p>
