<p>This documentation is for Mozilla developers who need to work on Mozilla's build system. The contents below will explain the basic concepts and terminology of the build system and how to do common tasks such as compiling components and creating jar files.</p>

<p>For many developers, typing <code>mach build</code> to build the tree is sufficient to work with the source tree. This document explains how the build system works.</p>

<div class="notecard note">
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>This document is not intended for developers who just want to build Mozilla. For that, see the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions">Build Documentation</a>.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="Concepts">Phases</h2>

<p>When you type <code>mach build</code> to build the tree, three high-level phases occur within the build system:</p>

<ol>
 <li>System detection and validation</li>
 <li>Preparation of the build backend</li>
 <li>Invocation of the build backend</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Phase_1_configure">Phase 1: configure</h3>

<p>Phase 1 centers around the <strong>configure</strong> script. The <strong>configure</strong> script is a bash shell script. The file is generated from a file called <strong>configure.in</strong>, which is written in <a href="http://www.seindal.dk/rene/gnu/">M4</a> and processed using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">Autoconf 2.13</a> to create the final <strong>configure</strong> script. You don't have to worry about how you obtain a <strong>configure</strong> file: the build system does this for you.</p>

<p>The primary job of <strong>configure</strong> is to determine characteristics of the system and compiler, apply options passed into it, and validate everything looks OK to build. The primary output of the <strong>configure</strong> script is an executable file in the object directory called <strong>config.status</strong>. <strong>configure</strong> also produces some additional files (like <strong>autoconf.mk</strong>). However, the most important file in terms of architecture is <strong>config.status</strong>.</p>

<p>The existence of a <strong>config.status</strong> file may be familiar to those who have worked with Autoconf before. However, Mozilla's <strong>config.status</strong> is different from many other <strong>config.status</strong> files, as it's written in Python! Instead of our <strong>configure</strong> script producing a shell script, it generates a Python script.</p>

<p>Python 2 is prevalent in a Mozilla build system. If we need to write code for the build system, we do it in <strong>Python 2</strong> instead of editing a <em>makefile</em>.</p>

<p><strong>config.status</strong> contains 2 parts:</p>

<ul>
 <li>data structures representing the output of <strong>configure</strong> and</li>
 <li>a command-line interface for preparing, configuring, or generating an appropriate <em>build backend</em>. A <em>build backend</em> is merely a tool used to build the tree — like <strong>GNU Make</strong> or <em>Tup</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These data structures describe the current <strong>state</strong> of the system and what the existing build configuration looks like. For example, a data structure defines which compiler to use, how to invoke it, which application features are enabled, and so on. You are encouraged to open <strong>config.status</strong> to have a look!</p>

<p>After we have emitted a <strong>config.status</strong> file, we proceed to Phase 2.</p>

<h3 id="Phase_2_Build_Backend_Preparation_and_the_Build_Definition">Phase 2: Build Backend Preparation and the Build Definition</h3>

<p>Once <strong>configure</strong> has determined what the current build configuration is, we need to apply this to the source tree so we can actually build.</p>

<p>What essentially happens is the automatically produced <strong>config.status</strong> Python script is executed as soon as <strong>configure</strong> has generated it. <strong>config.status</strong> is charged with the task of <em>telling a tool how to build the tree.</em> To do this, <strong>config.status</strong> must first scan the build system definition.</p>

<p>The build system definition consists of various <strong>moz.build</strong> files in the tree. There is roughly one <strong>moz.build</strong> file per directory or per set of related directories. Each <strong>moz.build</strong> file defines how its part of the build configuration works. For example, it says <em>I want these C++ files compiled</em> or <em>look for additional information in these directories</em>. <strong>config.status</strong> starts with the main <strong>moz.build</strong> file and then recurses into all referenced files and directories. As the <strong>moz.build</strong> files are read, data structures describing the overall build system definition are emitted. These data structures are then read by a <strong>build backend generator</strong>, which then converts them into files, function calls, and so on. In the case of a <em>make</em> backend, the generator writes out makefiles.</p>

<p>When <strong>config.status</strong> runs, you'll see the following output:</p>

<pre>Reticulating splines...
Finished reading 1096 moz.build files into 1276 descriptors in 2.40s
Backend executed in 2.39s
2188 total backend files. 0 created; 1 updated; 2187 unchanged
Total wall time: 5.03s; CPU time: 3.79s; Efficiency: 75%</pre>

<p>What this is saying is that a total of 1,096 <strong>moz.build</strong> files were read. Altogether, 1,276 data structures describing the build configuration were derived from them. It took 2.40s wall time just to read these files and produce the data structures. The 1,276 data structures were fed into the build backend, which then determined it had to manage 2,188 files derived from those data structures. Most of the files already existed and didn't need to be changed. However, one was updated as a result of the new configuration. The whole process took 5.03s. Of this, only 3.79s were in CPU time. This means we spent roughly 25% of the time waiting on I/O.</p>

<h3 id="Phase_3_Invocation_of_the_Build_Backend">Phase 3: Invocation of the Build Backend</h3>

<p>When most people think of the build system, they think of Phase 3. This is where we take all the code in the tree and produce the Firefox binary program file or the application you are creating. Phase 3 effectively takes whatever was generated by Phase 2 and runs it. Since the dawn of Mozilla, this has been done with the <em>make</em> tool, consuming makefiles. However, with the transition to <strong>moz.build</strong> files, you may eventually see non-<em>make</em> build backends, such as Tup or Visual Studio.</p>

<p>When building the tree, most of the time is spent in Phase 3. This is when header files are installed, C++ files are compiled, files are preprocessed, and so on.</p>

<h4 id="Build_Tiers">Recursive <em>Make</em> Backend</h4>

<p>The recursive <em>make</em> backend is the tried-and-true backend used to build the tree. It's what's been used since the dawn of Mozilla. Essentially, there are makefiles in each directory. <em>make</em> starts processing the makefile in the root directory and then recursively descends into child directories until it's done. But there's more to the process than that.</p>

<p>The recursive <em>make</em> backend divides the source tree into <em>tiers</em>. A tier is a grouping of related directories containing makefiles of their own. For example, there is a tier for the Netscape Portable Runtime (nspr), one for the JavaScript engine, one for the core Gecko platform, one for the XUL app being built, and so on.</p>

<p>The main <strong>moz.build</strong> file defines the tiers and directories in the tiers. In reality, the main <strong>moz.build</strong> files include other <strong>moz.build</strong> files, such as <code>/toolkit/toolkit.mozbuild</code>, which define the tiers. They do this via the <code>add_tier_dir()</code> function.</p>

<p>At build time, the tiers are traversed in the order they are defined. Typically, the traversal order looks something like <em>base</em>, <code>nspr</code>, <code>nss</code>, <code>js</code>, <code>platform</code>, <code>app</code>.</p>

<p>Each tier consists of three sub-tiers: <em>export</em>, <em>libs</em>, and <em>tools</em>. These sub-tiers roughly correspond to the actions of pre-build, main-build, and post-build. This naming, however, can be misleading because all three sub-tiers are part of the build:</p>

<ul>
 <li><em>export</em> is used to do things like copy headers into place.</li>
 <li><em>libs</em> is reserved for most of the work, like compiling C++ source files.</li>
 <li><em>tools</em> is used to install tests and other support tools.</li>
</ul>

<p>When <em>make</em> is invoked, it starts at the <em>export</em> sub-tier of the first tier, and traverses all the directories in that tier. Then, it does the same thing for the <em>libs</em> sub-tier and, subsequently, the <em>tools</em> sub-tier. It then moves on to the next tier and continues until no tiers remain.</p>

<p>To view information about the tiers, you can execute the following special <em>make</em> targets:</p>

<table class="fullwidth-table">
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <th>Command</th>
   <th>Effect</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>make echo-tiers</td>
   <td>Show the final list of tiers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>make echo-dirs</td>
   <td>Show the list of non-static source directories to iterate over, as determined by the tier list.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>make echo-variable-STATIC_DIRS</td>
   <td>Show the list of static source directories to iterate over, as determined by the tier list.</td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="moz.build_Files">moz.build Files</h2>

<p><strong>moz.build</strong> files are how each part of the source tree defines how it is integrated with the build system. Think of each <strong>moz.build</strong> file as a data structure telling the build system what to do.</p>

<p>During build backend generation, all <strong>moz.build</strong> files relevant to the current build configuration are read and converted into files and actions used to build the tree (such as makefiles). In this section, we'll talk about how <strong>moz.build</strong> files actually work.</p>

<p><strong>An individual moz.build file is actually a Python script.</strong> However, they are unlike most Python scripts. The execution environment is strictly controlled, so <strong>moz.build</strong> files can only perform a limited set of operations. <strong>moz.build</strong> files are limited to performing the following actions:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Calling functions that are explicitly made available to the <strong>moz.build</strong> environment.</li>
 <li>Assigning to a well-defined set of variables whose name is UPPERCASE.</li>
 <li>Creating new variables whose name is not UPPERCASE (this includes defining functions).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>moz.build</strong> files <strong>cannot</strong> do the following:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Import modules.</li>
 <li>Open files.</li>
 <li>Use the <em>print</em> statement or function.</li>
 <li>Reference many of Python's built-in or global functions (they are not made available to the execution environment).</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important actions of <strong>moz.build</strong> files are #1 and #2 from the above list. These are how the execution of a moz.build file tells the build system what to do. For example, you can assign to the <strong>DIRS</strong> list to define which directories to traverse into looking for additional <strong>moz.build</strong> files.</p>

<p>The output of the execution of an individual <strong>moz.build</strong> file is a Python dictionary. This dictionary contains the UPPERCASE variables directly assigned to and the special variables indirectly assigned to by calling functions exported to the execution environment. This is what we were referring to when we said you can think of <strong>moz.build</strong> files as data structures.</p>

<h3 id="moz.build_UPPERCASE_Variables_and_Functions">moz.build UPPERCASE Variables and Functions</h3>

<p>The set of special symbols available to <strong>moz.build</strong> files is centrally defined and is under the purview of the build configuration module. To view the variables and functions available in your checkout of the tree, run the following:</p>

<pre>mach mozbuild-reference</pre>

<p>Or, you can view the raw file at <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/frontend/context.py">/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/frontend/context.py</a>.</p>

<h3 id="How_moz.build_Processing_Works">How moz.build Processing Works</h3>

<p>For most developers, knowing that <strong>moz.build</strong> files are Python scripts that are executed and emit Python dictionaries describing the build configuration is enough. If you insist on knowing more, this section is for you.</p>

<p>All the code for reading <strong>moz.build</strong> files lives under <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/frontend/">/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/frontend/</a>. <strong>mozbuild</strong> is the name of our Python package that contains most of the code for defining how the build system works. <strong>moz.build</strong> files and <strong>mozbuild</strong> are different, so be careful not to confuse the two.</p>

<p><a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/frontend/sandbox.py">sandbox.py</a> contains code for a generic Python sandbox. This code is used to restrict the environment <strong>moz.build</strong> files are executed under.</p>

<p><a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/frontend/reader.py">reader.py</a> contains the code that defines the <strong>moz.build</strong> sandbox (the <code>MozbuildSandbox</code> class) and the code for traversing a tree of <strong>moz.build</strong> files (the <code>BuildReader</code> class) by following <code>DIRS</code> and <code>TIERS</code> variables. A <code>BuildReader</code> is instantiated with a configuration, is told to read the source tree, and then emits a stream of <code>MozbuildSandbox</code> instances corresponding to the executed <strong>moz.build</strong> files.</p>

<p>The <code>MozbuildSandbox</code> stream produced by the <code>BuildReader</code> is typically fed into the <code>TreeMetadataEmitter</code> class from <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/frontend/emitter.py">emitter.py</a>. The role of <code>TreeMetadataEmitter</code> is to convert the low-level <code>MozbuildSandbox</code> dictionaries into higher-level function-specific data structures. These data structures are the classes defined in <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/frontend/data.py">data.py</a>. Each class defines a specific aspect of the build system, such as directories to traverse, C++ files to compile, and so on. The <code>TreeMetadataEmitter</code> output is a stream of instances of these classes.</p>

<p>The build system stream describing class instances emitted from <code>TreeMetadataEmitter</code> is then fed into a build backend. A build backend is an instance of a child class of a <code>BuildBackend</code> from <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/backend/base.py">base.py</a> (in the <code>mozbuild.backend</code> package now, not <code>mozbuild.frontend</code>). The child class implements methods for processing individual class instances as well as common hook points, such as <em>processing has finished</em>. See <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/file/default/python/mozbuild/mozbuild/backend/recursivemake.py">recursivemake.py</a> for an implementation of a <code>BuildBackend</code>.</p>

<p>Although we call the base class <code>BuildBackend</code>, the class doesn't need to be focused with <em>building</em> at all. If you wanted to create a consumer that performed a line count of all C++ files or generated a Clang compilation database, for example, this would be an acceptable use of a <code>BuildBackend</code>.</p>

<p>Technically, we don't need to feed the <code>TreeMetadataEmitter</code> output into a <code>BuildBackend</code>: it's possible to create your own consumer. However, a <code>BuildBackend</code> provides a common framework from which to author consumers. Along the same vein, you don't need to use <code>TreeMetadataEmitter</code> to consume <code>MozbuildSandbox</code> instances. Nor do you need to use <code>BuildReader</code> to traverse the <strong>moz.build</strong> files. This is <em>just</em> the default framework we've established for our build system.</p>

<h2 id="Legacy_Content">Legacy Content</h2>

<p><strong>THE CONTENT BELOW IS CONSIDERED LEGACY. IT IS PRESERVED FOR HISTORICAL REASONS UNTIL THIS ENTIRE PAGE IS REWRITTEN.</strong></p>

<h3 id="Makefile_basics">Makefile basics</h3>

<p>Makefiles can be quite complicated, but Mozilla provides a number of built-in rules that should enable most makefiles to be simpler. Complete documentation for <em>make</em> is beyond the scope of this document but is available <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/">here</a>.</p>

<p>One concept you will need be familiar with is <em>variables</em> in <em>make</em>. Variables are defined by the syntax <code>VARIABLE = VALUE</code>, and the value of a variable is referenced by writing <code>$(VARIABLE)</code>. All variables are strings.</p>

<p>All Makefile.in files in Mozilla have the same basic format:</p>

<div>{{ page("/en-US/docs/Standard_Makefile_Header")}}</div>

<pre class="eval"># ... Main body of makefile goes here ...

include $(topsrcdir)/config/rules.mk

# ... Additional rules go here ...
</pre>

<ul>
 <li>The <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Configuring_Build_Options">DEPTH</a></code> variable should be set to the relative path from your Makefile.in to the top-level Mozilla directory.</li>
 <li><code>topsrcdir</code> is substituted in by configure and points to the top-level Mozilla directory.</li>
 <li><code>srcdir</code> is also substituted in by configure and points to the source directory for the current directory. In source tree builds, this will point to "." (the current directory).</li>
 <li><code><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Configuring_Build_Options">VPATH</a></code> is a list of directories where <em>make</em> will look for prerequisites (i.e., source files).</li>
</ul>

<p>One other frequently used variable not specific to a particular build target is <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Configuring_Build_Options">DIRS</a></code>. <code>DIRS</code> is a list of subdirectories of the current directory to recursively build in. Subdirectories are traversed <em>after</em> their parent directories. For example, you could have:</p>

<pre class="eval"><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Configuring_Build_Options">DIRS</a> = \
  public \
  resources \
  src \
  $(NULL)
</pre>

<p>This example demonstrates another concept called <em>continuation lines</em>. A backslash as the last character on a line allows the variable definition to be continued on the next line. The extra whitespace is compressed. The terminating $(NULL) is a method for consistency; it allows you to add and remove lines without worrying about whether the last line has an ending backslash or not.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="Building_libraries">Building libraries</h2>

<p>There are three main types of libraries that are built in Mozilla:</p>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Components</strong> are shared libraries (except in static builds), which are installed to dist/bin/components. Components are not linked against by any other library.</li>
 <li><strong>Non-component shared libraries</strong> include libraries such as libxpcom and libmozjs. These libraries are installed to dist/bin and are linked against. You will probably not need to create a new library of this type.</li>
 <li><strong>Static libraries</strong> are often used as intermediate steps to building a shared library, if there are source files from several directories that are part of the shared library. Static libraries may also be linked into an executable.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Non-component_shared_libraries">Non-component shared libraries</h3>

<p>A non-component shared library is useful when there is common code that several components need to share and sharing it through XPCOM is not appropriate or not possible. As an example, below is a portion of the makefile for libmsgbaseutil, which is linked against by all of the main news components:</p>

<pre class="eval"> DEPTH           = ../../..
 topsrcdir       = @top_srcdir@
 srcdir          = @srcdir@
 VPATH           = @srcdir@

 include $(DEPTH)/config/autoconf.mk

 <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Configuring_Build_Options">MODULE</a>          = msgbaseutil
 <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Configuring_Build_Options">LIBRARY_NAME</a>    = msgbaseutil
 <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Configuring_Build_Options">EXPORT_LIBRARY</a> = 1
 <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Configuring_Build_Options">SHORT_LIBNAME</a>   = msgbsutl
</pre>

<p>Notice that the only change from the component example above is that <strong>IS_COMPONENT</strong> is not set. When this is not set, a shared library will be created and installed to dist/bin.</p>

<h3 id="Static_libraries">Static libraries</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, static libraries are most commonly used as intermediate steps to building a larger library (usually a component). This lets you spread out the source files in multiple subdirectories. Static libraries may also be linked into an executable. As an example, below is a portion of the makefile from layout/base/src:</p>

<pre class="eval"> DEPTH           = ../../..
 topsrcdir       = @top_srcdir@
 srcdir          = @srcdir@
 VPATH           = @srcdir@

 include $(DEPTH)/config/autoconf.mk

 MODULE          = layout
 LIBRARY_NAME    = gkbase_s

 # REQUIRES and CPPSRCS omitted here for brevity #

 # we don't want the shared lib, but we want to force the creation of a static lib.
 <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Configuring_Build_Options">FORCE_STATIC_LIB</a> = 1

 include $(topsrcdir)/config/rules.mk
</pre>

<p>The key here is setting <strong>FORCE_STATIC_LIB</strong> = 1. This creates libgkbase_s.a (on UNIX) and gkbase_s.lib on Windows and copies it to dist/lib. Now, let's take a look at how to link several static libraries together to create a component:</p>

<pre class="eval"> DEPTH           = ../..
 topsrcdir       = @top_srcdir@
 srcdir          = @srcdir@
 VPATH           = @srcdir@

 include $(DEPTH)/config/autoconf.mk

 MODULE          = layout
 LIBRARY_NAME    = gklayout
 EXPORT_LIBRARY = 1
 <a href="/en-US/docs/IS_COMPONENT">IS_COMPONENT</a>    = 1
 <a href="/en-US/docs/MODULE_NAME">MODULE_NAME</a>     = nsLayoutModule

 <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Configuring_Build_Options">CPPSRCS</a>         = \

                 $(NULL)

 <a href="/en-US/docs/SHARED_LIBRARY_LIBS">SHARED_LIBRARY_LIBS</a> = \

                 $(DIST)/lib/$(LIB_PREFIX)gkxulgrid_s.$(LIB_SUFFIX) \
                 $(NULL)

 include $(topsrcdir)/config/rules.mk</pre>

<p><strong>SHARED_LIBRARY_LIBS</strong> is set to a list of static libraries, which should be linked into this shared library. Note the use of <strong>LIB_PREFIX</strong> and <strong>LIB_SUFFIX</strong> to make this work on all platforms.</p>

<h2 id="Building_jar_files">Building jar files</h2>

<p>jar files are used for packaging chrome files (XUL, JavaScript, and CSS). For more information on jar packaging, see <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/build/jar-packaging.html">this document</a>. Here, we will only cover how to set up a makefile to package jars. Below is an example:</p>

<pre class="eval"> DEPTH           = ../../../..
 topsrcdir       = @top_srcdir@
 srcdir          = @srcdir@
 VPATH           = @srcdir@

 include $(DEPTH)/config/autoconf.mk

 include $(topsrcdir)/config/rules.mk
</pre>

<p>As you can see, there are no extra variables to define. If a <strong><a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/JAR_Manifests">jar.mn</a></strong> file exists in the same directory as this Makefile.in, it will automatically be processed. Although the common practice is to have a <strong>resources</strong> directory that contains the jar.mn and chrome files, you may also put a jar.mn file in a directory that creates a library, in which case it will be processed.</p>
