<p>In the Mozilla codebase, the compiler, at least recent version of gcc, is set to default to hidden symbols, in order to avoid a some problems. </p>

<div class="notecard note">
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>Include the whole rationale here</p>
</div>

<p>For this reason any system header included in the build has to be wrapped to make the symbols it defines visible. These so called system headers are listed in &lt;tt&gt;mozilla/config/system-headers&lt;/tt&gt;</p>

<p>The main symptom of the problem is if you get a message like this at link time:</p>

<pre class="eval">/usr/lib/gcc/i586-suse-linux/4.3/../../../../i586-suse-linux/bin/ld: libwidget_gtk2.so: hidden symbol `gtk_tree_view_new' isn't defined
</pre>

<p>This means that the header that declares &lt;tt&gt;gtk_tree_view_new()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;gtk/gtktreeview.h&lt;/tt&gt; in this case, is not in &lt;tt&gt;mozilla/config/system-headers&lt;/tt&gt;.</p>
