<p>When first getting started as a contributor to the Mozilla project, there's a lot of information to sort through and understand. To help you find the most critical stuff as quickly as possible, we've created this list of the articles you'll find most useful as you get yourself oriented and make your first contributions to the project.</p>

<p>Also, before you go any further, we'd like to welcome you to the Mozilla community of developers! We look forward to your input!</p>

<p>To add pages to the list above, open the page you'd like to add in the <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Editor">MDN editor</a> by clicking the Edit button near the top of the page. Scroll to the bottom of the page to the <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Editor/Basics#The_tags_box">tags list</a> and add the tag "Introduction". After a short while, the page will automatically appear in the list above.</p>

<p>You can, optionally, add the tag "Important" to shuffle the page toward the top of this list, but don't overuse it, or it will be less useful a tool for steering readers to the best content.</p>
