<p>The UX team are currently re-evaluating their processes for requesting UX review and feedback, as the old methods didn't scale. In the mean time, if you need consultation on the UX of your project, please directly contact the designer you’ve been working with for ui-reviews. If you don’t know who that designer is, talk to your PM. If you don’t have a designer or PM, talk to your engineering manager about what the current priorities are, and who to talk to in order to get UX and PM help for your project.</p>
