{{FirefoxSidebar}}

This page lists Firefox's experimental and partially-implemented features, including evolving or proposed web platform standards.
Each entry below includes information about the builds in which a feature is included (Nightly, Beta, Developer Edition, or Release), whether it is activated by default or not, and the name of the **preference** you can use to activate or configure the feature.
The description of each feature also includes links to relevant [Bugzilla bugs](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org) that implement or enable the feature.
This information allows you to try out experimental features and provide feedback before they are officially released.

In terms of lifecycle, new features usually appear first in [Nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#nightly), where they are often enabled by default for early feedback and testing.
If no major problems are found, they are included in [Beta](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#beta) and [Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) pre-release builds. Finally, approved features ship in the [stable Release](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) channel.
When a feature is enabled by default in a release, it is no longer considered experimental and is removed from this page.

To enable these features, enter `about:config` in the Firefox address bar, search for the associated **preference** and change its value, which is usually a toggle between `true` and `false`.
Depending on the feature, you might need to restart the browser for the change to take effect.
Check the [Firefox Configuration Editor](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-config-editor-firefox) support article for more information about managing preferences in Firefox.

## HTML

### Layout for input type="search"

Layout for `input type="search"` has been updated. This causes a search field to have a clear icon once someone starts typing in it, to match other browser implementations. (See [Firefox bug 558594](https://bugzil.la/558594) for more details.)

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 81            | No                  |
| Developer Edition | 81            | No                  |
| Beta              | 81            | No                  |
| Release           | 81            | No                  |

- `layout.forms.input-type-search.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### Toggle password display

HTML password input elements ([`<input type="password">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/password)) include an "eye" icon that can be toggled to display or obscure the password text ([Firefox bug 502258](https://bugzil.la/502258)).

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 96            | No                  |

| Beta              | 96            | No                  |
| Release           | 96            | No                  |

- `layout.forms.reveal-password-button.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

## CSS

### Hex boxes to display stray control characters

This feature renders control characters (Unicode category Cc) other than _tab_ (`U+0009`), _line feed_ (`U+000A`), _form feed_ (`U+000C`), and _carriage return_ (`U+000D`) as a hex box when they are not expected. (See [Firefox bug 1099557](https://bugzil.la/1099557) for more details.)

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 43            | Yes                 |
| Developer Edition | 43            | No                  |
| Beta              | 43            | No                  |
| Release           | 43            | No                  |

- `layout.css.control-characters.visible`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### initial-letter property

The {{cssxref("initial-letter")}} CSS property is part of the [CSS Inline Layout](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-inline/) specification and allows you to specify how dropped, raised, and sunken initial letters are displayed. (See [Firefox bug 1223880](https://bugzil.la/1223880) for more details.)

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 50            | No                  |
| Developer Edition | 50            | No                  |
| Beta              | 50            | No                  |

- `layout.css.initial-letter.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### fit-content() function

The {{cssxref("fit-content_function", "fit-content()")}} function as it applies to {{cssxref("width")}} and other sizing properties. This function is already well-supported for CSS Grid Layout track sizing. (See [Firefox bug 1312588](https://bugzil.la/1312588) for more details.)

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 91            | No                  |
| Developer Edition | 91            | No                  |
| Beta              | 91            | No                  |
| Release           | 91            | No                  |

- `layout.css.fit-content-function.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### Scroll-driven animations

Previously called "scroll-linked animations", a [scroll-driven animation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll-driven_animations) depends on the scroll position of a scrollbar instead of time or some other dimension.
The {{cssxref('scroll-timeline-name')}} and {{cssxref('scroll-timeline-axis')}} properties (and the {{cssxref('scroll-timeline')}} shorthand property) allow you to specify that a particular scrollbar in a particular named container can be used as the source for a scroll-driven animation.
The scroll timeline can then be associated with an [animation](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_animations) by setting the {{cssxref('animation-timeline')}} property to the name value defined using `scroll-timeline-name`.

When using the {{cssxref('scroll-timeline')}} shorthand property, the order of the property values must be {{cssxref('scroll-timeline-name')}} followed by {{cssxref('scroll-timeline-axis')}}.
The longhand and shorthand properties are both available behind the preference.
You can alternatively use the [`scroll()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timeline/scroll) functional notation with {{cssxref('animation-timeline')}} to indicate that a scrollbar axis in an ancestor element will be used for the timeline.

For more information, see [Firefox bug 1807685](https://bugzil.la/1807685), [Firefox bug 1804573](https://bugzil.la/1804573), [Firefox bug 1809005](https://bugzil.la/1809005), [Firefox bug 1676791](https://bugzil.la/1676791), [Firefox bug 1754897](https://bugzil.la/1754897), [Firefox bug 1817303](https://bugzil.la/1817303), and [Firefox bug 1737918](https://bugzil.la/1737918).

The {{cssxref('timeline-scope')}}, {{cssxref('animation-range-start')}} and {{cssxref('animation-range-end')}} properties (and the {{cssxref('animation-range')}} shorthand property) are not yet supported. For more information, see [Firefox bug 1676779](https://bugzil.la/1676779).

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 136           | Yes                 |
| Developer Edition | 110           | No                  |
| Beta              | 110           | No                  |

- `layout.css.scroll-driven-animations.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### @scope at-rule

The [@scope](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@scope) [CSS](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) [at-rule](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_syntax/At-rule) allows you to select specific child elements without having to overly increase the specificity of CSS selectors ([Firefox bug 1886441](https://bugzil.la/1886441)).

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 137           | Yes                 |
| Developer Edition | 128           | No                  |

- `layout.css.at-scope.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### font-variant-emoji property

The CSS [`font-variant-emoji`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-variant-emoji) property allows you to set a default presentation style for displaying emojis.
See ([Firefox bug 1461589](https://bugzil.la/1461589)) for more details.

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 108           | Yes                 |
| Developer Edition | 108           | No                  |
| Beta              | 108           | No                  |
| Release           | 108           | No                  |

- `layout.css.font-variant-emoji.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### prefers-reduced-transparency media feature

The CSS [`prefers-reduced-transparency`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-transparency) media feature lets you detect if a user has enabled the setting to minimize the amount of transparent or translucent layer effects on their device.
See ([Firefox bug 1736914](https://bugzil.la/1736914)) for more details.

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 113           | No                  |
| Developer Edition | 113           | No                  |
| Beta              | 113           | No                  |
| Release           | 113           | No                  |

- `layout.css.prefers-reduced-transparency.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### inverted-colors media feature

The CSS [`inverted-colors`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/inverted-colors) media feature lets you detect if a user agent or the underlying operating system is inverting colors.
See ([Firefox bug 1794628](https://bugzil.la/1794628)) for more details.

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 114           | No                  |
| Developer Edition | 114           | No                  |
| Beta              | 114           | No                  |
| Release           | 114           | No                  |

- `layout.css.inverted-colors.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### Named view progress timelines property

The CSS [`view-timeline-name`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/view-timeline-name) property lets you give a name to particular element, identifying that its ancestor scroller element is the source of a view progress timeline.
The name can then be assigned to the `animation-timeline`, which then animates the associated element as it moves through the visible area of its ancestor scroller.
See ([Firefox bug 1737920](https://bugzil.la/1737920)) for more details.

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 114           | No                  |
| Developer Edition | 114           | No                  |
| Beta              | 114           | No                  |
| Release           | 114           | No                  |

- `layout.css.scroll-driven-animations.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### Anonymous view progress timelines function

The CSS [`view()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timeline/view) function lets you specify that the `animation-timeline` for an element is a view progress timeline, which will animate the element as it moves through the visible area of its ancestor scroller.
The function defines the axis of the parent element that supplies the timeline, along with the inset within the visible area at which the animation starts and begins.
See ([Firefox bug 1808410](https://bugzil.la/1808410)) for more details.

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 114           | No                  |
| Developer Edition | 114           | No                  |
| Beta              | 114           | No                  |
| Release           | 114           | No                  |

- `layout.css.scroll-driven-animations.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### Vendor-prefixed transform properties

The `-moz-` prefixed [CSS transform](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_transforms) properties can be disabled by setting the `layout.css.prefixes.transforms` preference to `false`. The intent is to disable these once the standard CSS zoom properties are well supported. ([Firefox bug 1886134](https://bugzil.la/1886134), [Firefox bug 1855763](https://bugzil.la/1855763)).

Specifically, this preference will disable the following prefixed properties:

- `-moz-backface-visibility`
- `-moz-perspective`
- `-moz-perspective-origin`
- `-moz-transform`
- `-moz-transform-origin`
- `-moz-transform-style`

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 120           | Yes                 |
| Developer Edition | 120           | Yes                 |
| Beta              | 120           | Yes                 |
| Release           | 120           | Yes                 |

- `layout.css.prefixes.transforms`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### UA styles for `<h1>` nested in sectioning elements

The `<h1>` heading doesn't decrease in font size now when nested within [sectioning elements](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Guides/Content_categories#sectioning_content) `<article>`, `<aside>`, `<nav>`, and `<section>`. The UA styles for `<h1>` nested within sectioning elements are no longer relevant since the outline algorithm [has been removed](https://github.com/whatwg/html/pull/7829) from the HTML specification. ([Firefox bug 1883896](https://bugzil.la/1883896)).

> [!NOTE]
> The preference for this feature works in reverse: when set to `false`, it removes the UA styling for headings nested in sectioning elements.
> When set to `true`, it retains the existing UA styling for the nested headings.

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 125           | No                  |
| Developer Edition | 125           | Yes                 |
| Beta              | 125           | Yes                 |
| Release           | 125           | Yes                 |

- `layout.css.h1-in-section-ua-styles.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to keep existing UA styles for nested headings.

### `shape()` function

The CSS [`shape()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/basic-shape/shape) function is a [`<basic-shape>`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/basic-shape) data type that enables you to define a shape in the {{cssxref("clip-path")}} and {{cssxref("offset-path")}} properties using one or more "shape commands". These commands are very similar to the [SVG path commands](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Attribute/d#path_commands). The `shape()` function is similar in some respects to the {{cssxref("basic-shape/path","path()")}} function, but unlike `path()`, which uses the [SVG path](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Reference/Element/path) syntax, `shape()` uses standard CSS syntax. This enables you to easily create and edit shapes and also allows the use of CSS math functions.
For more details, see [Firefox bug 1823463](https://bugzil.la/1823463) for the `shape()` function support in `clip-path`, [Firefox bug 1884424](https://bugzil.la/1884424) for the function's support in `offset-path`, and [Firefox bug 1884425](https://bugzil.la/1884425) for its interpolation support.

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 126           | Yes                 |
| Developer Edition | 126           | No                  |
| Beta              | 126           | No                  |
| Release           | 126           | No                  |

- `layout.css.basic-shape-shape.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### Symmetrical `letter-spacing`

The CSS {{cssxref("letter-spacing")}} property now splits the specified letter spacing evenly on both sides of each character. This is unlike the current behavior where spacing is added primarily to one side. This approach can improve text spacing, especially in mixed-directional text [Firefox bug 1891446](https://bugzil.la/1891446).

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 128           | Yes                 |
| Developer Edition | 128           | Yes                 |
| Beta              | 127           | No                  |
| Release           | 127           | No                  |

- `layout.css.letter-spacing.model`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### `calc()` color channel support in relative colors

The CSS [`calc()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc) function can now parse color channels in [relative colors](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_colors/Relative_colors#using_math_functions), allowing you to correctly calculate changes to colors in different color spaces or while using different functional notations [Firefox bug 1889561](https://bugzil.la/1889561).

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 127           | Yes                 |
| Developer Edition | 127           | No                  |
| Beta              | 127           | No                  |
| Release           | 127           | No                  |

- `layout.css.relative-color-syntax.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### CSS Anchor Positioning

The [CSS Anchor Positioning](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_anchor_positioning) module defines a number of features that allow elements to be defined as anchor elements, and for other elements to be positioned relative to anchor elements.
This allows, for example, tooltips to be displayed alongside associated content as it scrolls through the viewport, moving as needed when it would overflow the viewport, and disappearing when the anchor moves offscreen.
The set of features are being progressively rolled out behind a preference ([Firefox bug 1838746](https://bugzil.la/1838746)).

The parts that have been implemented include [`CSSPositionTryRule`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSPositionTryRule) and [`CSSPositionTryDescriptors`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSPositionTryDescriptors) (Firefox 131).

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |

| Beta              | 131           | No                  |
| Release           | 131           | No                  |

- `layout.css.anchor-positioning.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### `::details-content` pseudo-element

The CSS {{cssxref("::details-content")}} pseudo-element enables you to style the content of the {{htmlElement("details")}} element ([Firefox bug 1901037](https://bugzil.la/1901037)).

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |

### Allow pseudo-elements after element-backed pseudo-elements

Work has started on allowing [pseudo-elements](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) such as {{cssxref("::first-letter")}} and {{cssxref("::before")}} to be appended to [element-backed pseudo-elements](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements#element-backed_pseudo-elements) such as {{cssxref("::details-content")}} and {{cssxref("::file-selector-button")}}.

This will allow users to, for , example, style the first letter of the {{htmlElement("details")}} element by using the CSS selector `::details-content::first-letter` or add content before an {{HTMLElement("input") }} of [`type="file"`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/file) using the CSS selector `::file-selector-button::before`.

Currently only support for `::details-content::first-letter` can be parsed, using `@supports(::details-content::first-letter)` and the preference for [::details-content pseudo-element](#details-content_pseudo-element) needs enabling for this to be tested. The `::file-selector-button` pseudo-element is not yet marked as an element-based pseudo-element so there is no current way of testing this. ([Firefox bug 1953557](https://bugzil.la/1953557)).

### Atomics.waitAsync()

The {{jsxref("Atomics.waitAsync()")}} static method waits asynchronously on a shared memory location and returns an object representing the result of the operation.
It is non-blocking and usable on the main thread. ([Firefox bug 1467846](https://bugzil.la/1467846)).

## APIs

### CloseWatcher Interface

Built-in web components with "open" and "close" semantics, such as modal dialogs and popovers, can be closed using device-native mechanisms.
For example, on Android you can close a dialog using the back button.
The {{domxref("CloseWatcher")}} interface allows developers to implement UI components, such as custom sidebars, that can similarly be closed using native mechanisms.
([Firefox bug 1888729](https://bugzil.la/1888729)).

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default?          |

### Trusted Types API

The [Trusted Types API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API) provides mechanisms to ensure that functions that can potentially be used as vectors for XSS attacks are only able to be called with data that has been validated or sanitized.

> [!NOTE]
> At the time of writing not enough of the API has been implemented for it to be effectively testable.
> This note will be removed once it is ready.

This subset of the API has been implemented:

- {{domxref("TrustedTypePolicyFactory")}}:
  - {{domxref("TrustedTypePolicyFactory/getAttributeType", "getAttributeType()")}} and {{domxref("TrustedTypePolicyFactory/getPropertyType", "getPropertyType()")}} ([Firefox bug 1917783](https://bugzil.la/1917783), [Firefox bug 1917784](https://bugzil.la/1917784)).
- The {{domxref("Document.write()", "write()")}} and {{domxref("Document.writeln()","writeln()")}} methods of the {{domxref("Document")}} interface now accept {{domxref("TrustedHTML")}} objects as parameters, in addition to strings. ([Firefox bug 1906301](https://bugzil.la/1906301)).
- The {{domxref("HTMLScriptElement.text","text")}}, {{domxref("HTMLElement.innerText","innerText")}}, and {{domxref("Node.textContent","textContent")}} properties of the {{domxref("HTMLScriptElement")}} interface now accept {{domxref("TrustedScript")}} objects a value, while {{domxref("HTMLScriptElement.src", "src")}} accepts {{domxref("TrustedScriptURL")}} values. ([Firefox bug 1905706](https://bugzil.la/1905706)).
- The {{domxref("Window.setInterval()")}} and {{domxref("Window.setTimeout()")}} methods can be called with a {{domxref("TrustedScript")}}. ([Firefox bug 1931290](https://bugzil.la/1931290)).
- The global [`trustedTypes`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/trustedTypes) property is available for accessing the Trusted Types API.
- The properties {{domxref("Element.innerHTML")}} and {{domxref("ShadowRoot.innerHTML")}} can be called with [trusted types](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Trusted_Types_API).

### `closedBy` attribute for `<dialog>`

The {{domxref("HTMLDialogElement/closedBy", "closedBy")}} attribute of the {{domxref("HTMLDialogElement")}} interface, and corresponding [`closedby`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/dialog#closedby) attribute of the {{htmlelement("dialog")}} element, are supported.
These can be used by developers to specify whether users can close a dialog by clicking outside of the dialog area, or the dialog must be closed programmatically, and so on.
([Firefox bug 1964077](https://bugzil.la/1964077)).

### Notification actions and maxActions properties

The {{domxref("Notification/actions","actions")}} read-only property and the [`maxActions`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification/maxActions_static) static read-only property of the {{domxref("Notification")}} interface are supported in Nightly on desktop.
These contain the notification actions set with {{domxref("ServiceWorkerRegistration.showNotification()")}}, and the maximum number of actions that can be set, respectively.
([Firefox bug 1225110](https://bugzil.la/1225110), [Firefox bug 1963263](https://bugzil.la/1963263)).

### Graphics: Canvas, WebGL, and WebGPU

#### WebGL: Draft extensions

When this preference is enabled, any WebGL extensions currently in "draft" status which are being tested are enabled for use. Currently, there are no WebGL extensions being tested by Firefox.

#### WebGPU API

The [WebGPU API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGPU_API) provides low-level support for performing computation and graphics rendering using the [Graphics Processing Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_Processing_Unit) (GPU) of the user's device or computer. See [Firefox bug 1602129](https://bugzil.la/1602129) for our progress on this API.

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |

### Reporting API support for CSP Violations

The [Reporting API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Reporting_API) now has support for reporting [Content Security Policy (CSP)](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CSP) violations.

{{domxref('Report')}} instances returned by the {{domxref('ReportingObserver')}} interface can now have a `type` value of `"csp-violation"` and a `body` property that contains an instance of the {{domxref('CSPViolationReportBody')}} interface.
This allows CSP violations to be reported within a web page.

CSP violation reports can also be sent to remote endpoints that are specified by name in the CSP {{CSP("report-to")}} directive — endpoints names and corresponding URLs must first be defined in the {{httpheader('Reporting-Endpoints')}} or {{httpheader('Report-To')}} HTTP response headers.
The report is a serialization of the {{domxref('Report')}} object described above, with a `body` property that is a serialization of an {{domxref('CSPViolationReportBody')}} instance.

This violation report replaces a similar CSP-specific mechanism for sending violation reports, which uses the CSP {{CSP("report-uri")}} directive to set the URL of the reporting endpoint, and has a [CSP-specific JSON violation report format](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-uri#violation_report_syntax).

### WebRTC and media

The following experimental features include those found in the [WebRTC API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API), the [Web Audio API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API), the [Media Source Extensions API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Source_Extensions_API), the [Encrypted Media Extensions API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Encrypted_Media_Extensions_API), and the [Media Capture and Streams API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Capture_and_Streams_API).

#### Asynchronous SourceBuffer add and remove

This adds the promise-based methods {{domxref("SourceBuffer.appendBufferAsync", "appendBufferAsync()")}} and {{domxref("SourceBuffer.removeAsync", "removeAsync()")}} for adding and removing media source buffers to the {{domxref("SourceBuffer")}} interface. See [Firefox bug 1280613](https://bugzil.la/1280613) and [Firefox bug 778617](https://bugzil.la/778617) for more information.

#### AVIF compliance strictness

The `image.avif.compliance_strictness` preference can be used to control the _strictness_ applied when processing [AVIF](/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Guides/Formats/Image_types#avif_image) images.
This allows Firefox users to display images that render on some other browsers, even if they are not strictly compliant.

| Release channel   | Version added | Default value |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Nightly           | 92            | 1             |

| Release           | 92            | 1             |

- `image.avif.compliance_strictness`
  - : Numeric value indicating a _strictness_ level. Permitted values are:
    - `0`: Permissive. Accept images with specification violations in both recommendations ("should" language) and requirements ("shall" language), provided they can be safely or unambiguously interpreted.
    - `1` **(default)**: Mixed. Reject violations of requirements ("shall"), but allow violations of recommendations ("should").
    - `2`: Strict. Reject any violations of specified requirements or recommendations.

#### JPEG XL support

Firefox supports [JPEG XL](https://jpeg.org/jpegxl/) images if this feature is enabled.
See [Firefox bug 1539075](https://bugzil.la/1539075) for more details.

Note that, as shown below, the feature is only available on Nightly builds (irrespective of whether the preference is set).

### WebVR API

#### WebVR API (Disabled)

The deprecated [WebVR API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVR_API) is on the path for removal.
It is disabled by default on all builds [Firefox bug 1750902](https://bugzil.la/1750902).

- `dom.vr.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### HTML DOM API

#### Selections crossing shadow DOM boundary

The {{domxref("Selection.getComposedRanges()")}} method can be used to get an array of {{domxref("StaticRange")}} objects representing the current selected range or ranges.
Unlike {{domxref("Selection.getRangeAt()")}}, this method can return ranges with anchor or focus nodes inside a shadow DOM, but only if it is passed the {{domxref("ShadowRoot")}} objects that contain those nodes.
Otherwise, it will return a range that has been re-scoped to include the host node of the shadow root that contains the node.
The `Selection` methods {{domxref("Selection.setBaseAndExtent()","setBaseAndExtent()")}}, {{domxref("Selection.collapse()","collapse()")}}, and {{domxref("Selection.extend()","extend()")}} have also been modified to accept nodes inside a shadow root.

User selection via mouse, keyboard, and so on, can start and end anywhere in the document, including inside any open or closed shadow trees.
([Firefox bug 1867058](https://bugzil.la/1867058)).

- `dom.shadowdom.selection_across_boundary.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

#### HTMLMediaElement properties: audioTracks and videoTracks

Enabling this feature adds the {{domxref("HTMLMediaElement.audioTracks")}} and {{domxref("HTMLMediaElement.videoTracks")}} properties to all HTML media elements. However, because Firefox doesn't currently support multiple audio and video tracks, the most common use cases for these properties don't work, so they're both disabled by default. See [Firefox bug 1057233](https://bugzil.la/1057233) for more details.

### Payment Request API

#### Primary payment handling

The [Payment Request API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Payment_Request_API) provides support for handling web-based payments within web content or apps. Due to a bug that came up during testing of the user interface, we have decided to postpone shipping this API while discussions over potential changes to the API are held. Work is ongoing. (See [Firefox bug 1318984](https://bugzil.la/1318984) for more details.)

  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### Screen Orientation API

#### ScreenOrientation.lock()

The {{domxref("ScreenOrientation.lock()")}} method allows a device to be locked to a particular orientation, if supported by the device and allowed by browser pre-lock requirements.
Typically locking the orientation is only allowed on mobile devices when the document is being displayed full screen.
See [Firefox bug 1697647](https://bugzil.la/1697647) for more details.

| Release channel   | Version changed | Enabled by default? |

  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### Prioritized Task Scheduling API

The [Prioritized Task Scheduling API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Prioritized_Task_Scheduling_API) provides a standardized way to prioritize all tasks belonging to an application, whether they are defined in a website developer's code, or in third-party libraries and frameworks.
From Firefox version 140 the API is both feature complete and enabled in the Nightly release.
([Firefox bug 1734997](https://bugzil.la/1734997) and [Firefox bug 1920115](https://bugzil.la/1920115)).

| Release channel   | Version changed | Enabled by default? |

- `dom.enable_web_task_scheduling`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### Notifications API

Notifications have the [`requireInteraction`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification/requireInteraction) property set to true by default on Windows systems and in the Nightly release ([Firefox bug 1794475](https://bugzil.la/1794475)).

| Release channel   | Version changed | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 117             | Yes                 |
| Developer Edition | 117             | No                  |
| Beta              | 117             | No                  |

- `dom.webnotifications.requireinteraction.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### View Transition API

The [View Transition API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API) provides a mechanism for easily creating animated transitions between different website views. This is especially useful for [SPAs (single-page applications)](/en-US/docs/Glossary/SPA). ([Firefox bug 1950759](https://bugzil.la/1950759)).

| Release channel   | Version changed | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 139             | Yes                 |

| Beta              | —               | No                  |
| Release           | —               | No                  |

- `dom.viewTransitions.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

## Security and privacy

### Block plain text requests from Flash on encrypted pages

In order to help mitigate man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks caused by Flash content on encrypted pages, a preference has been added to treat `OBJECT_SUBREQUEST`s as active content. See [Firefox bug 1190623](https://bugzil.la/1190623) for more details.

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 59            | No                  |
| Developer Edition | 59            | No                  |
| Beta              | 59            | No                  |
| Release           | 59            | No                  |

- `security.mixed_content.block_object_subrequest`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### Insecure page labeling

The two `security.insecure_connection_text_*` preferences add a "Not secure" text label in the address bar next to the traditional lock icon when a page is loaded insecurely (that is, using {{Glossary("HTTP")}} rather than {{Glossary("HTTPS")}}). The `browser.urlbar.trimHttps` preference trims the `https:` prefix from address bar URLs. See [Firefox bug 1853418](https://bugzil.la/1853418) for more details.

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 121           | Yes                 |
| Developer Edition | 60            | No                  |
| Beta              | 60            | No                  |
| Release           | 60            | No                  |

- `security.insecure_connection_text.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable the text label for normal browsing mode.
- `security.insecure_connection_text.pbmode.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable the text label for private browsing mode.
- `browser.urlbar.trimHttps`
  - : Set to `true` to trim the `https:` prefix from address bar URLs.

### Permissions Policy / Feature policy

[Permissions Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Permissions_Policy) allows web developers to selectively enable, disable, and modify the behavior of certain features and APIs in the browser. It is similar to CSP but controls features instead of security behavior.
This is implemented in Firefox as **Feature Policy**, the name used in an earlier version of the specification.

Note that supported policies can be set through the [`allow`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/iframe#allow) attribute on `<iframe>` elements even if the user preference is not set.

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |

| Beta              | 65            | No                  |
| Release           | 65            | No                  |

- `dom.security.featurePolicy.header.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### Privacy Preserving Attribution API (PPA)

[PPA API](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/privacy-preserving-attribution) provides an alternative to user tracking for ad attribution using the new `navigator.privateAttribution` object with `saveImpression()` and `measureConversion()` methods. Read more about PPA [in the original explainer](https://github.com/mozilla/explainers/tree/main/archive/ppa-experiment) and the [proposed spec](https://w3c.github.io/ppa/). This experiment can be enabled for websites via [origin trial](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Origin_Trials) or in the browser by setting the preference to `1`. ([Firefox bug 1900929](https://bugzil.la/1900929)).

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 128           | No                  |

- `dom.origin-trials.private-attribution.state`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

## HTTP

### Accept header with MIME type image/jxl

The HTTP [`Accept`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept) header in [default requests and image requests](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Content_negotiation/List_of_default_Accept_values) can be configured via a preference to indicate support for the `image/jxl` MIME type.

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 128           | No                  |
| Developer Edition | 128           | No                  |
| Beta              | 128           | No                  |
| Release           | 128           | No                  |

- `image.jxl.enabled`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### SameSite=Lax by default

[`SameSite` cookies](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Set-Cookie#samesitesamesite-value) have a default value of `Lax`.
With this setting, cookies are only sent when a user is navigating to the origin site, not for cross-site subrequests to load images or frames into a third party site and so on.
For more details see [Firefox bug 1617609](https://bugzil.la/1617609).

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------------------- |
| Nightly           | 69            | No                  |

| Beta              | 69            | No                  |
| Release           | 69            | No                  |

- `network.cookie.sameSite.laxByDefault`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

### Access-Control-Allow-Headers wildcard does not cover Authorization

The [`Access-Control-Allow-Headers`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Headers) is a response header to a [CORS preflight request](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Preflight_request), that indicates which request headers may be included in the final request.
The response directive can contain a wildcard (`*`), which indicates that the final request may include all headers except the `Authorization` header.

By default, Firefox includes the `Authorization` header in the final request after receiving a response with `Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *`.
Set the preference to `false` to ensure Firefox does not include the `Authorization` header.
For more details see [Firefox bug 1687364](https://bugzil.la/1687364).

| Release channel   | Version added | Enabled by default? |

| Release           | 115           | Yes                 |

- `network.cors_preflight.authorization_covered_by_wildcard`
  - : Set to `true` to enable.

## Developer tools

Mozilla's developer tools are constantly evolving. We experiment with new ideas, add new features, and test them on the Nightly and Developer Edition channels before letting them go through to beta and release. The features below are the current crop of experimental developer tool features.

**No experimental features in this release cycle.**
