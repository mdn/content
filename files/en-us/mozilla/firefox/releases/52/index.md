### HTML

- The `rel="noopener"` [Link type](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types) has been implemented (see {{bug(1222516)}}).

### CSS

#### New features

- Added {{cssxref(":focus-within")}} pseudo-class ({{bug(1176997)}}).
- Added support for `display:flex/grid` and columnset layout inside {{HTMLElement("button")}} elements ({{bug(984869)}}).
- Implemented interpolation between numeric color and [currentcolor](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#currentcolor_keyword) ({{bug(1299741)}}).
- Implemented flexbox layout for `{{cssxref("justify-content")}}: space-evenly` and `{{cssxref("align-content")}}: space-evenly` ({{bug(1235922)}}).
- Added support for subpixel antialiasing in CSS {{cssxref("mask")}} / {{cssxref("clip-path")}} ({{bug(1305259)}}).
- Implemented CSS Text 3 segment break transformation rules ({{bug(1081858)}}).
- Basic shape clipping (as applied via the {{cssxref("clip-path")}} property) can now be applied to SVG content ({{bug(1246741)}}).
- Implemented Flexbox layout for {{cssxref("align-self")}}|{{cssxref("justify-self")}}: \[ first | last ]? baseline ({{bug(1221524)}}).
- The {{cssxref("touch-action")}} property is now enabled by default on all platforms. (For the full story, see [intent to ship mail #1](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/6CGjsm1XpD4) and [intent to ship mail #2](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/SYEzvXJKw9M).)
- Flexbox {{cssxref("align-content")}} handling & single-line-sizing should depend on {{cssxref("flex-wrap")}}, not number of lines ({{bug(1090031)}}).
- [CSS Animations](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Animations) can now be used to animate non-interpolated properties (see {{bug("1064937")}}).
- Changed `baseline|last-baseline` to `[ first | last ]? baseline` ({{bug(1313254)}}).
- The used value for `left`/`right` is `start` for the block-axis ({{bug(1221565)}}).
- Stretching flexible tracks with an indefinite containing block length now respects the min/max size({{bug(1309407)}}).
- The initial values of {{cssxref("mask-position")}} and {{cssxref("mask-repeat")}} have been changed to `0% 0%` and `repeat`, respectively ({{bug(1308963)}}).
- There have been a number of changes to CSS {{cssxref("&lt;color&gt;")}} values (see {{bug(1295456)}}):

  - `rgba()` and `hsla()` have now been redefined as aliases of `rgb()` and `hsl()`; both accept the same parameter syntax.
  - `rgb(`) and `hsl()` now accept an optional alpha value, e.g. `rgb(255, 0, 0, 0.5)`.
  - Color functions now accept space-separated parameters rather than commas, e.g. `rgb(255 0 0 / 0.5)`.
  - Alpha values can now be specified as percentages as well as numbers, e.g. `rgb(255 0 0 / 50%)`.
  - The hue component in `hsl()` colors can now be specified as an angle, as well as a number, e.g. `hsl(120deg, 60%, 70%)`.

- Firefox's implementation of child-indexed pseudo-classes (such as {{cssxref(":nth-child")}}, {{cssxref(":first-child")}}, and so forth) has been updated to match the CSS4 specification: these pseudo-classes now match the appropriate sibling elements rather than the children of their parent element. This allows these pseudo-classes to be used when there is no parent, or the parent is not an {{domxref("Element")}} ({{bug(1300374)}}.

#### CSS Grids

- [CSS Grids](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) are implemented.

#### Changes and removals

- Unprefixed multi-column properties (and added back `-moz` prefixed versions as aliases, for now) ({{bug(1300895)}}).
- Stopped wrapping abspos children of flex container in anonymous flex items({{bug(1269045)}}).
- Implemented grid container baselines ({{bug(1151204)}}).
- Removed `<flex>` min-sizing from the style system ({{bug(1305244)}}).
- Remove preference `layout.css.masking.enabled` ({{bug(1308239)}}).
- The proprietary `-moz-images-in-menus` and `-moz-images-in-buttons` [media types](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries#media_features) have been removed (see {{bug(1302157)}}).
- Removed `-moz-use-text-color` value from color properties; use [`currentcolor`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value#currentcolor_keyword) instead ({{bug(1306214)}}).
- \[css-grid] 'max-width' set on grid item causes text to overflow ({{bug(1330380)}}).

### JavaScript

#### New features

- Support for the async functions has been added. This adds {{jsxref("Statements/async_function", "async function")}}, {{jsxref("Operators/async_function", "async function expression")}}, and the {{jsxref("Operators/await", "await")}} keyword ({{bug(1185106)}}).
- Implemented ES2017 [trailing commas](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Trailing_commas) in functions ({{bug(1303788)}}).
- Implemented {{jsxref("Functions/rest_parameters", "rest parameter destructuring", "#Destructuring_rest_parameters", 1)}} ({{bug(1243717)}}).
- The {{jsxref("Operators", "exponentiation operator (**)", "#Exponentiation_(**)", 1)}} is now enabled by default ({{bug(1291212)}}).
- You can now use [IANA time zone names](http://www.iana.org/time-zones) in the `timeZone` option of date related APIs like {{jsxref("Intl/DateTimeFormat", "DateTimeFormat")}} or {{jsxref("Date.toLocaleString()")}} ({{bug(837961)}}).

#### Changes and removals

- [Array destructuring](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#assigning_the_rest_of_an_array_to_a_variable) now throws a {{jsxref("SyntaxError")}} when using destructuring rest with trailing comma ({{bug(1041341)}}).
- Duplicate `__proto__` properties are now allowed in [object destructuring](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) ({{bug(1204024)}}).
- {{jsxref("Array.prototype.toLocaleString()")}} has been re-implemented to support the Intl API parameters "`locales`" and "`options`" ({{bug(1130636)}}).
- {{jsxref("TypedArray")}} constructors now accept [iterables](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols) to create new typed arrays ({{bug(1232266)}}).
- {{jsxref("TypedArray.from()")}}, {{jsxref("TypedArray.of()")}}, {{jsxref("TypedArray.prototype.filter()")}}, {{jsxref("TypedArray.prototype.map()")}}, {{jsxref("TypedArray.prototype.slice()")}}, {{jsxref("TypedArray.prototype.subarray()")}} now require that their `this` values are valid Typed Array constructors ({{bug(1122396)}}).
- The non-standard {{jsxref("ArrayBuffer.slice()")}} method (not {{jsxref("ArrayBuffer.prototype.slice()")}}) is deprecated and now presents a warning when used ({{bug(1316913)}}).
- [Unicode code point escapes](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#unicode_code_point_escapes) can now also be used as identifiers (e.g. "`let \u{61} = 123`", see {{bug(1314037)}}).
- To conform with ES2015, `\u2e2f` and `ⸯ` now throw when used as identifier, for details see {{bug(917436)}} and {{bug(1197230)}}.

### WebAssembly

- Support for [WebAssembly](/en-US/docs/WebAssembly) has been added to Gecko.

### DOM

- The [Selection API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection) has fully shipped, including the new {{Event("selectstart")}} and {{Event("selectionchange")}} events (see also {{domxref("GlobalEventHandlers.onselectstart")}} and {{domxref("GlobalEventHandlers.onselectionchange")}}) ({{bug(1309612)}}).
- The property {{domxref("Event.composed")}} is now supported; this Boolean value indicates whether or not the event can bubble through the shadow root into the standard DOM ({{bug(1292063)}}).
- Only HTML elements, plus the {{HTMLElement("svg")}} and {{HTMLElement("math")}} elements, can be put into full-screen mode by calling {{domxref("Element.requestFullScreen()")}} ({{bug(1305928)}}).
- [Touch events](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events) have been reenabled on Windows desktop platforms — see {{bug(1244402)}}. (They were disabled in Firefox 24 because they broke a number of major sites; see {{bug(888304)}}.)
- The {{event("focusin")}} and {{event("focusout")}} events are now implemented ({{bug("687787")}}).
- The {{domxref("isSecureContext")}} property has been implemented (see {{bug(1269052)}}).
- The [Web App Manifest](/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) install event has been renamed appinstalled (see {{domxref("Window.onappinstalled")}}, {{event("appinstalled")}}) to avoid confusion with the service worker install event (see {{domxref("ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.oninstall")}}). See {{bug(1309099)}} for more details about this update.
- The {{domxref("DataTransfer.types")}} property of the [Drag and drop API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Drag_and_Drop_API) now returns a frozen array of {{domxref("DOMString")}}s rather than a {{domxref("DOMStringList")}} (see {{bug(1298243)}}).
- The {{Event("loadstart")}} and {{Event("loadend")}} events are now fired on {{htmlelement("img")}} elements (see {{bug(1264769)}}, and also see {{domxref("GlobalEventHandlers.onloadstart")}} and {{domxref("GlobalEventHandlers.onloadend")}}).
- The {{domxref("Notification.requireInteraction")}} of the [Notifications API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API) has been implemented (see {{bug(862395)}}.)
- The {{domxref("Window.open()")}} method now has a `noopener` [window feature](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open#window_functionality_features) available (see {{bug(1267339)}}), which mirrors the functionality of the `rel="noopener"` [Link type](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Link_types).
- The {{domxref("CustomElementRegistry.get()")}} method of the [Web Components API](/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) has been implemented (see {{bug(1275838)}}).
- [Pointer Event](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Pointer_events) {{domxref("PointerEvent.width","width")}} and {{domxref("PointerEvent.height","height")}} properties now default to a value of 1 (see {{bug(1304315)}}).
- The [File and Directory Entries API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_and_Directory_Entries_API) has been updated to include changes in the [latest spec](https://wicg.github.io/entries-api/) (see {{bug(1284987)}} for the exact details).
- The {{domxref("Event.cancelBubble", "cancelBubble")}} property, which was defined on {{domxref("UIEvent")}}, is now defined on the {{domxref("Event")}} interface instead. See {{bug(1298970)}} for more details.

#### Changes and removals

- The Firefox OS APIs that deal with managing phone calls (Contacts, MobileConnection, Icc, etc.) have been removed ({{bug(1311206)}}).
- The Firefox OS `Identity` interface has been removed ({{bug(1309030)}}).
- The Firefox OS Voicemail API [`MozVoicemail`](/en-US/docs/Archive/B2G_OS/API/MozVoicemail), [`MozVoicemailEvent`](/en-US/docs/Archive/B2G_OS/API/MozVoicemailEvent), [`MozVoicemailStatus`](/en-US/docs/Archive/B2G_OS/API/MozVoicemailStatus), [`Navigator.mozVoicemail`](/en-US/docs/Archive/B2G_OS/API/Navigator/mozVoicemail)) has been removed ({{bug(1309723)}}).
- The Firefox OS Cell Broadcast API (`MozCellBroadcast`, `MozCellBroadcastEvent`, `MozCellBroadcastMessage`, `Navigator.mozCellBroadcast`) has been removed ({{bug(1306772)}}).
- The Firefox OS TV broadcast-related APIs have been removed ({{bug(1306778)}}).
- The Firefox OS FM Radio API ([`FMRadio`](/en-US/docs/Archive/B2G_OS/API/FMRadio), [`Navigator.mozFMRadio`](/en-US/docs/Archive/B2G_OS/API/Navigator/mozFMRadio)) has been removed ({{bug(1306779)}}).

### Service Workers and Fetch

- The `Headers.getAll()` method has been removed, and {{domxref("Headers.get()")}} now retrieves all values of the specified header, not just the first one (see {{bug(1278275)}}). This is in accordance with the latest Fetch API spec updates.

### Web Audio API

- The {{domxref("ConstantSourceNode")}} interface has been added; it represents an audio source which always outputs a stream of samples which all have the same value. See [Controlling multiple parameters with ConstantSourceNode](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API/Controlling_multiple_parameters_with_ConstantSourceNode) for an example showing how this can be used to simplify some complex audio flows.

### WebRTC

- When an ICE connection is temporarily disrupted, the {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection.iceConnectionState")}} property now gets set to `"disconnected"`; this indicates a transitory failure that may resolve itself shortly, with the connection returning to the `"connected"` state afterward ({{bug(852665)}}).
- The {{domxref("MediaDevices.ondevicechange")}} event handler and corresponding {{event("devicechange")}} event, which were implemented but disabled by default on Mac only in Firefox 51, have been implemented on Windows and Linux and are now enabled by default on all platforms.
- The {{domxref("MediaStream.active")}} property is now supported. This read-only Boolean property indicates whether or not at least one track on the stream is currently playing.
- Prior to Firefox 52, the {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.stop()")}} method could only stop local tracks (that is, tracks obtained through {{domxref("MediaDevices.getUserMedia", "getUserMedia()")}}). Now a variety of tracks can be stopped, including those on a {{domxref("MediaStream")}} associated with a [WebRTC](/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebRTC) connection, [Web Audio API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) stream, or {{domxref("CanvasCaptureMediaStreamTrack", "CanvasCaptureMediaStream")}}.
- Previously, changing a {{domxref("TextTrack")}}'s {{domxref("TextTrack.mode", "mode")}} repeatedly during a single pass through the Firefox event loop would result in multiple {{event("change")}} events being delivered to the {{domxref("TextTrackList")}} specified by the parent media element's {{domxref("HTMLMediaElement.textTracks", "textTracks")}} property. Now these changes are consolidated into one event ({{bug(882674)}}).

### Audio/Video/Media

- The {{domxref("MediaError")}} objects specified in {{domxref("HTMLMediaElement.error")}} when an error occurs handling an {{HTMLElement("audio")}} or {{HTMLElement("video")}} element now include a {{domxref("MediaError.message", "message")}} property, which provides a specific description of the error which occurred. This string offers details particular to this exact error occurrence, offering insight into why things went wrong ({{bug(1299072)}}). This field has been included in Firefox nightly builds since Firefox 51, but is now available in all builds, up to and including release.

### Other APIs

- The method {{domxref("FileSystemFileEntry.createWriter()")}}, which was added (but always returned an error) in Firefox 50 has been removed ({{bug(1315185)}}.
- The proprietary Firefox OS [Apps installation/management APIs](/en-US/docs/Archive/Marketplace/API/App_installation_and_management_APIs) have been removed from the platform (see {{bug(1261019)}}).
- The proprietary Firefox OS [Web Telephony API](/en-US/docs/Archive/Firefox_OS/Web_Telephony_API) has been removed from the platform (see {{bug(1309719)}}).
- The proprietary Firefox OS [Web Bluetooth API](/en-US/docs/Archive/Firefox_OS/Bluetooth_API) has been removed from the platform (see {{bug(1310020)}}).
- The [Battery Status API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Battery_Status_API) is now available only to chrome/privileged code (see {{bug(1313580)}}).
- `ImageBitmapRenderingContext.transferImageBitmap()` has been renamed to {{domxref("ImageBitmapRenderingContext.transferFromImageBitmap()")}} (see {{bug(1304767)}}).
- The `mozDash` and `mozDashOffset` members have been removed from {{domxref("CanvasRenderingContext2D")}} (see {{bug(931389)}}).

### HTTP

- The {{HTTPHeader("Referrer-Policy")}} header now supports the directives `same-origin`, `strict-origin`, and `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` ({{bug(1276836)}}).
- The [`'strict-dynamic'` source expression](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src#strict-dynamic) is now supported for {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}} directives, such as {{CSP("script-src")}} ({{bug(1299483)}}).
- Insecure sites (`http:`) can't [set cookies](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies) with the "secure" directive anymore as per the [Strict Secure Cookies specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-cookie-alone-01) ({{bug(976073)}}).
- The maximum table size format of the HTTP/2 header compression format [HPACK](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7541) has been increased from 4 KB to 64 KB ({{bug(1296280)}}).
- The {{HTTPHeader("Large-Allocation")}} header has been added ({{bug(1304140)}}).

### SVG

- SVG documents are now represented using the {{domxref("XMLDocument")}} interface instead of SVGDocument. This is a change made in the SVG 2 specification.

### Security

- When login pages (i.e those containing an [`<input type="password">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/password) field) are created so that they would be submitted insecurely, Firefox displays an in-context warning message below the password field to warn users ({{bug(1319119)}}). Autofill is also disabled on insecure login forms ({{bug(1217152)}}). See [Insecure passwords](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Insecure_passwords) for more details.
- Support for SHA-1 SSL certificates has been removed; navigating to a secure page that uses a SHA-1 certificate will now result in an [Untrusted Connection](https://support.mozilla.org/t5/Documents-Archive/quot-This-Connection-is-Untrusted-quot-error-message-appears/ta-p/589) error ({{bug(1330043)}}).

## Plugins

All NPAPI [plugin](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Plugins) support except Flash has been dropped. Flash usage is also set to be phased out in the future.

## Changes for add-on and Mozilla developers
