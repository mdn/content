## Changes for web developers

### Developer tools

#### Debugger

- [Event Listener Breakpoints](/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/Set_event_listener_breakpoints) let you diagnose which code a page executes in response to browser events. You can pick specific types, such as `click` or `keydown`, or whole categories of events, like all mouse input events. ({{bug(1526082)}}).
- Scripts shown in the debugger's  [source list pane](/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/UI_Tour#source_list_pane) can now be saved via the _Download file_ context menu option ({{bug(888161)}}).
- In the debugger's source list pane, loaded extensions are listed with their name, rather than just their {{Glossary("UUID")}} ({{bug(1486416)}}), making it much easier to find the extension code you want to debug.
- The debugger now loads significantly faster via lazy-loading scripts ({{bug(1527488)}}).

#### Console

- [Browser Console](/en-US/docs/Tools/Browser_Console) messages from [tracking protection errors](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Privacy/Tracking_Protection), [CSP errors](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP), and [CORS errors](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors) are grouped automatically to reduce noise from repeated blocked resources and storage access ({{bug(1522396)}}).
- All visible logs in the console can shared by saving to a file or copying to clipboard via a new _Export visible messages to_ context menu item ({{bug(1517728)}}).
- The console's toolbar now responsively reduces its height into a single row to save vertical space ({{bug(972530)}}).
- Messages from content can now be hidden in the console to focus on logs from the Firefox UI ({{bug(1523842)}}).

#### Network

- Resources that got blocked because of [CSP](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) or [Mixed Content](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Mixed_content) are now shown in the Network panel, with details of the reason ({{bug(1556451)}}).
- A new optional _URL_ column in the Network panel can be enabled to show the full URL for resources ({{bug(1341155)}}).

#### Inspector

- When you hover over an element in the [Page Inspector](/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector), the infobar that appears now includes the fact that an element is a flex container, or flex item ({{bug(1521188)}}).
- When inspecting a page containing a grid with a subgrid, the parent grid's overlay lines are displayed whenever the subgrid's lines are displayed; if the parent grid's overlay checkbox is unselected, then its lines are translucent ({{bug(1550519)}}).

#### Remote debugging

- For our mobile web developers, we have migrated remote debugging from the old WebIDE into a re-designed [about:debugging](/en-US/docs/Tools/about:debugging), making the experience of debugging [GeckoView](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/06/geckoview-in-2019/) on remote devices via USB much better ({{bug(1462208)}}).

#### General

- The DevTools panel order has been changed to reflect popularity ({{bug(1558630)}}).

### HTML

- In order to align more closely to the specification, the text track associated with a {{HTMLElement("track")}} element no longer loads the WebVTT file containing the text cues if the element is created in its default `disabled` {{domxref("TextTrack.mode", "mode")}}. To access or manipulate the cues when the `mode` is `disabled`, change the `mode` to either `started` or `hidden`; this will trigger loading of the WebVTT data ({{bug(1550633)}}).

####  Removals

- The HTML {{HTMLElement("keygen")}} element has been removed from Firefox. It was deprecated some time ago, and its purpose has generally been supplanted by other technologies ({{bug(1315460)}}).

### CSS

- We implemented the `break-spaces` value of the {{cssxref("white-space")}} property ({{bug(1351432)}}).
- The SVG geometry attributes (such as {{SVGAttr("width")}} and {{SVGAttr("height")}}) can now also be defined as CSS properties ({{bug(1383650)}}).
- The {{cssxref("::cue")}} selector — used to style the captions ("cues") displayed by [WebVTT](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API) — now enforces the limitations on which CSS properties may be used within cues, as per the specification ({{bug(1321488)}}).
- We've restricted the properties that may apply to {{cssxref("::marker")}} as per the specification ({{bug(1552578)}})
- The {{cssxref("overflow-block")}} and {{cssxref("overflow-inline")}} properties have been implemented ({{bug(1470695)}}).
- We added the ability to test for support of a selector when using CSS Feature Queries ({{cssxref("@supports")}}), with the `selector()` method ({{bug(1513643)}}).
- The {{cssxref("user-select")}} property — which specifies whether or not the user is able to select text in the affected element — has been unprefixed ({{bug(1492739)}}).
- We implemented local-specific casing behavior for Lithuanian ({{bug(1322992)}}), [as seen in this example](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-transform#lowercase_lithuanian).
- We've implemented the {{cssxref("line-break")}} property of CSS Text ({{bug(1011369)}} and {{bug(1531715)}}).
- The {{cssxref("contain")}} property — which allows developers to define that an element and its contents are mostly independent of the rest of the DOM tree — got implemented {{bug(1487493)}}.

### SVG

- We've added support for gzip-compressed SVG-in-OpenType ({{bug(1359240)}}).
- The {{domxref("SVGGeometryElement.isPointInFill()")}} and {{domxref("SVGGeometryElement.isPointInStroke()")}} methods have been implemented ({{bug(1325319)}}).

### JavaScript

- [Public class fields](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#field_declarations) are enabled by default ({{bug(1555464)}}). See also [Class fields](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Public_class_fields) for more information.
- The promise rejection events [`unhandledrejection`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/unhandledrejection_event) and [`rejectionhandled`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/rejectionhandled_event) are now enabled by default ({{bug(1362272)}}). To learn more about how these work, see {{SectionOnPage("/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises", "Promise rejection events")}}.

### HTTP

- The HTTP headers {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Expose-Headers")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods")}}, and {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers")}} now accept a wildcard value "`*`" for requests without credentials ({{bug(1309358)}}). This change has also been uplifted to Firefox 68 ESR.

### APIs

#### New APIs

- The [Resize Observer API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Resize_Observer_API) is supported by default ({{bug(1543839)}}).
- The Microtask API ({{domxref("queueMicrotask()")}}) has been implemented ({{bug(1480236)}}).

#### DOM

- The {{domxref("DOMMatrix")}}, {{domxref("DOMPoint")}}, and related objects are now supported in workers ({{bug(1420580)}}).
- The `pageX` and `pageY` properties have been moved from {{domxref("UIEvent")}} to {{domxref("MouseEvent")}}, for better spec compliance ({{bug(1178763)}}). These properties are no longer exposed to the {{domxref("CompositionEvent")}}, {{domxref("FocusEvent")}}, {{domxref("InputEvent")}}, {{domxref("KeyboardEvent")}}, and {{domxref("TouchEvent")}} interfaces, which all inherit from `UIEvent`.
- The {{domxref("Blob.text()")}}, {{domxref("Blob.arrayBuffer()")}}, and {{domxref("Blob.stream()")}} methods are now implemented ({{bug(1557121)}}).
- {{domxref("DOMMatrix.fromMatrix()")}} has been implemented ({{bug(1560462)}}).
- We now support the six-parameter version of the {{domxref("DOMMatrix.scale()")}} method ({{bug(1397945)}}).
- The arguments for {{domxref("DOMMatrix.translate()")}}, {{domxref("DOMMatrix.skewX()")}}, and {{domxref("DOMMatrix.skewY()")}} are now all optional, as per spec ({{bug(1397949)}}).
- The {{domxref("NavigatorID/userAgent", "navigator.userAgent")}}, {{domxref("NavigatorID/platform", "navigator.platform")}}, and {{domxref("navigator.oscpu")}} properties no longer reveal whether a user is running 32-bit Firefox on a 64-bit OS ({{bug(1559747)}}). They now say `Linux x86_64` instead of `Linux i686 on x86_64`, and `Win64` instead of `WOW64`.
- The remaining methods of {{domxref("HTMLDocument")}} have been moved to {{domxref("Document")}}. This should have no appreciable impact on your work in most cases. In particular, the {{domxref("document.close", "close()")}}, {{domxref("document.open", "open()")}}, and {{domxref("document.write", "write()")}} methods have been moved. So have the various editor related methods, including {{domxref("document.execCommand", "execCommand()")}} as well as various properties ({{bug(1549560)}}).
- We have implemented {{domxref("AbstractRange")}} and {{domxref("StaticRange")}} ({{bug(1444847)}}).

#### Media, Web Audio, and WebRTC

- For improved user security, and in-keeping with the latest versions of the [Media Capture and Streams](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Media_Streams_API) specification, the {{domxref("navigator.mediaDevices")}} property is no longer present if the context is insecure. To use {{domxref("MediaDevices.getUserMedia", "getUserMedia()")}}, {{domxref("MediaDevices.getDisplayMedia", "getDisplayMedia()")}}, {{domxref("MediaDevices.enumerateDevices", "enumerateDevices()")}}, and so forth, be sure your content is loaded using {{Glossary("HTTPS")}} ({{bug(1528031)}}).
- The Web Audio API's {{domxref("AudioParam.value")}} property now returns the actual value of the property at the current time, taking into account all scheduled or gradiated value changes. Previously, Firefox only returned the most recent explicitly-set value (as through using the `value` setter) ({{bug(893020)}}).
- We've updated {{domxref("MediaStreamAudioSourceNode")}} to use the new, lexicographical, ordering for tracks. Previously, track ordering was up to the individual browser, and could even change arbitrarily. In addition, attempting to create a `MediaStreamAudioSourceNode` using a stream that has no audio tracks now throws an `InvalidStateError` exception ({{bug(1553215)}}).
- The {{domxref("MediaTrackSettings.facingMode", "facingMode")}}, {{domxref("MediaTrackSettings.deviceId", "deviceId")}}, and {{domxref("MediaTrackSettings.groupId", "groupId")}} settings are now included as members of the {{domxref("MediaTrackSettings")}} object returned by calls to {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.getSettings()")}} ({{bug(1537986)}}).

#### Removals

- The {{domxref("DOMMatrix.scaleNonUniformSelf()")}} method has been removed ({{bug(1560119)}}).

### WebDriver conformance (Marionette)

#### Other

- Marionette now dynamically handles the opening and closing of modal dialogs and user prompts ({{bug(1477977)}}), which also means that multiple open prompts will be handled ({{bug(1487358)}}).
- Tracking protection and DOM push features are now disabled by default to avoid the removal of parts of the DOM, and extra notifications ({{bug(1542244)}}).
- Automatic unloading of background tabs if Firefox runs into a low memory condition is now disabled — this badly interacts with automation when switching between tabs ({{bug(1553748)}}).

## Changes for add-on developers

### API changes

- The [UserScripts API](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/userScripts) is now enabled by default.
- The [`topSites.get()`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/topSites/get) method now has new options available — `includePinned` and `includeSearchShortcuts` ({{bug(1547669)}}).

### Other changes

- There are now [Group Policy options](https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/blob/master/README.md#extensionsettings) to blacklist all extensions except the ones that have been whitelisted ({{bug(1522823)}}).
