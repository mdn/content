## Changes for web developers

### HTML

#### Removals

### MathML

#### Removals

- The deprecated `scriptminsize` and `scriptsizemultiplier` attributes have been removed ({{bug(1772697)}}).

### CSS

- The {{CSSxRef("backdrop-filter")}} property (which can be used to apply graphical effects such as blurring or color shifting to the area behind an element) is now available by default. It was earlier behind a preference setting ({{bug(1578503)}}).
- The {{CSSxRef("scroll-snap-stop")}} property is now available ({{bug(1312165)}}). You can use this property's `always` and `normal` values to specify whether or not to pass the snap points, even when scrolling fast.
- Support has been added for the {{CSSxRef(":modal")}} pseudo class. It selects all elements that are in a state in which they exclude all interaction with other elements until the interaction has been dismissed ({{bug(1768535)}}).
- The [`style`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/contain#style) value for the `contain` property is now supported. You can use this value for properties that can have effects on more than just an element and its descendants for effects don't escape the containing element. For more information, see ({{bug(1463600)}}).

#### Removals

### JavaScript

- Native Error types can now be serialized using the [structured clone algorithm](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Structured_clone_algorithm).
  This includes {{JSxRef("Error")}}, {{JSxRef("EvalError")}}, {{JSxRef("RangeError")}}, {{JSxRef("ReferenceError")}}, {{JSxRef("SyntaxError")}}, {{JSxRef("TypeError")}}, {{JSxRef("URIError")}} and {{JSxRef("AggregateError")}}.
  Serialized properties include the [`name`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/name), [`message`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/message), [`cause`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/cause), [`fileName`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/fileName), [`lineNumber`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/lineNumber) and [`columnNumber`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error/columnNumber).
  For {{JSxRef("AggregateError")}} the `message`, `name`, `cause` and `errors` properties are serialized.
  See {{bug(1556604)}} for more details.

#### Removals

### HTTP

#### Removals

### Security

#### Removals

### APIs

- [`ReadableStream`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream), [`WritableStream`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WritableStream), [`TransformStream`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransformStream) are now [Transferable objects](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Transferable_objects), which means that ownership can be transferred when sharing the objects between a window and workers using `postMessage`, or when using [structuredClone()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/structuredClone) to copy an object.
  After transferring, the original object cannot be used.
  See {{bug(1659025)}} for more details.

- [`caches`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/caches), [`CacheStorage`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CacheStorage), and [`Cache`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache) now require a [secure context](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts); the properties/interfaces are not defined if used in an insecure context.
  Previously `cache` would return a `CacheStorage` that would throw an exception if used outside of a secure context.
  See {{bug(1112134)}} for more details.

#### DOM

#### Media, WebRTC, and Web Audio

#### Removals

### WebAssembly

#### Removals

### WebDriver conformance (WebDriver BiDi, Marionette)

#### WebDriver BiDi

- Added a preference to disable experimental BiDi commands and events `remote.experimental.enabled` ({{bug(1777951)}}).
- Added a `script` module with an experimental implementation of the `evaluate` command. Only available if `remote.experimental.enabled` is set to `true` ({{bug(1742979)}}).
- Added serialization support for collections with simple values and complex objects, used for instance for the event data of `log.entryAdded` or the return value of `script.evaluate` ({{bug(1770752)}}).
- Fixed an edge case for `browsingContext.navigate` when navigating to a cached image ({{bug(1763133)}}).

#### Marionette

- Updated the `platformVersion` capability to be returned as `moz:platformVersion` ({{bug(1771760)}}).
- Removed support for `ChromeElement`; all elements are now serialized as `WebElement` ({{bug(1775036)}} and {{bug(1775064)}}).

## Changes for add-on developers
