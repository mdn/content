This article provides information about the changes in Firefox 97 that affect developers. Firefox 97 was released on February 8, 2022.

## Changes for web developers

### HTML

No notable changes

### CSS

- The CSS units `cap` and `ic` are now supported for use with {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} and {{cssxref("&lt;length-percentage&gt;")}} data types.
  For more information, see {{bug(1702924)}} and {{bug(1531223)}}.

- The CSS property `color-adjust` has been renamed to {{cssxref("print-color-adjust")}} to match the relevant specification.
  The `color-adjust` shorthand name is deprecated.
  See {{bug(747595)}} for details.

- CSS cascade layers are now available by default. The [`@layer`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@layer) rule declares a cascade layer, which allows declaration of styles and can be imported via the [`@import`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@import) rule using the `layer()` function. See {{bug(1699217)}} for more details.

- The global CSS keyword {{cssxref("revert-layer")}} has been added to allow rolling back of property values in one cascade layer to the matching rules in the previous cascade layer. This keyword can be applied on any property, including the CSS shorthand property {{cssxref("all")}}. For more information, see {{bug(1699220)}}.

- The CSS [`scrollbar-gutter`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scrollbar-gutter) property is now supported. This gives developers control over reserved space for the scrollbar, preventing unwanted layout changes as the content grows.
  See {{bug(1715112)}} for more details.

### JavaScript

No notable changes

### SVG

- The SVG {{SVGAttr('d')}} attribute, used to define a path to be drawn, can now be used as a property in CSS.
  It accepts the values [path()](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/path) or `none`. (See {{bug(1744599)}} for details.)

#### Removals

- A number of `SVGPathSeg` APIs are now disabled by default behind a preference, and are expected to be removed in future revisions.
  This includes: `SVGPathSegList`, [SVGPathElement.getPathSegAtLength()](/en-US/docs/Web/API/SVGPathElement), `SVGAnimatedPathData`.
  (See {{bug(1388931)}} for more details.)

### APIs

- `AnimationFrameProvider` is now available in a [`DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/DedicatedWorkerGlobalScope). This means the [`requestAnimationFrame`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame) and [`cancelAnimationFrame`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/cancelAnimationFrame) methods can be used within a dedicated worker.
  (See {{bug(1388931)}} for more details.)

#### DOM

- The reason for an abort signal can now be set using {{domxref("AbortController.abort()")}} (or {{domxref("AbortSignal.abort()")}}), and will be available in the {{domxref("AbortSignal.reason")}} property.
  This reason defaults to being an "AbortError" {{domxref("DOMException")}}.
  The reason can be thrown or handled via promise rejection as appropriate.
  ({{bug(1737771)}}).
- The convenience method {{domxref("AbortSignal.throwIfAborted()")}} can be used to check if a signal has been aborted, and if so throw the {{domxref("AbortSignal.reason()")}}.
  This makes it easier for developers to handle abort signals in code where you can't simply pass the signal to an abortable method. ({{bug(1745372)}}).

### WebDriver conformance (Marionette)

- `Marionette:Quit` accepts a new boolean parameter, `safeMode`, to restart Firefox in safe mode ({{bug(1144075)}}).
- Improved stability for `WebDriver:NewSession` and `WebDriver:NewWindow` when waiting for the current or initial document to be loaded ({{bug(1739369)}}, {{bug(1747359)}}).

## Changes for add-on developers

- `cookieStoreId` in {{WebExtAPIRef("tabs.query")}} supports an array of strings. This enables queries to match tabs against more than one cookie store ID ({{bug(1730931)}}).
- `cookieStoreId` added to {{WebExtAPIRef("contentScripts.register")}}. This enables extensions to register container-specific content scripts ({{bug(1470651)}}).
