<div>{{FirefoxSidebar}}</div><p>This article provides information on steps you need to take in order to update your existing add-on for compatibility with Firefox 8. See <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Releases/8" title="Firefox 8 for developers">Firefox 8 for developers</a> for a complete list of everything that changed in Firefox 8.</p>
<h2 id="Do_you_need_to_do_anything_at_all">Do you need to do anything at all?</h2>
<p>If your add-on is distributed on <a class="external" href="http://addons.mozilla.org">addons.mozilla.org</a> (AMO), it's been checked by an automated compatibility verification tool. Add-ons that don't use APIs that changed in Firefox 8, and have no binary components (which <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Interface_Compatibility#binary_interfaces">need to be recompiled for every major Firefox release</a>), have automatically been updated on AMO to indicate that they work in Firefox 8.</p>
<p>So you should start by visiting AMOÂ and looking to see if your add-on needs any work done at all.</p>
<div class="note">
 <strong>Note:</strong> You should still test your add-on on Firefox 8, even if it's been automatically upgraded. There are edge cases that may not be automatically detected.</div>
<p>Once you've confirmed that you need to make changes, come on back to this page and read on.</p>
<h2 id="Development_process_note">Development process note</h2>
<p>It's worth noting that during startup, Firefox 8 now checks for third-party add-ons on its first startup, and presents a user interface letting users decide whether or not to enable them. If you drop your add-on into the profile directory in order to test it, Firefox won't enable it automatically on the first startup, but will show this interface instead.</p>
<p>You can avoid this by setting the preference <code>extensions.autoDisableScopes</code> to 14. This should only be done for development and testing purposes.</p>
<h2 id="Interfaces_have_been_merged">Interfaces have been merged</h2>
<p>As part of our ongoing effort to streamline Gecko's internals, a few interfaces have been merged together:</p>
<ul>
 <li>{{ interface("nsIDOMWindowInternal") }} has been merged into {{ interface("nsIDOMWindow") }}. The <code>nsIDOMWindowInternal</code> interface still exists, but is empty, and will be removed entirely in Firefox 9. You should update any code that relies on the existence of <code>nsIDOMWindowInternal</code> to look for <code>nsIDOMWindow</code> instead.</li>
 <li>All of the sub-interfaces of {{ interface("nsISelection") }} have been merged into the base <code>nsISelection</code> interface. If by some chance you were previously looking for {{ interface("nsISelection2") }} or {{ interface("nsISelection3") }}, you should update your code.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Date_handling_improved">Date handling improved</h2>
<p>Now that the JavaScript <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date"><code>Date</code></a> object can parse ISO 8601 dates, the <code><a href="/en-US/docs/JavaScript_code_modules/ISO8601DateUtils.jsm" title="ISO8601DateUtils.jsm">ISO8601DateUtils.jsm</a></code> code module has been removed. If you were using this code module, you should update your code to use the methods on <code>Date</code> instead.</p>
<h2 id="DOM_changes">DOM changes</h2>
<p>There have been a couple of changes in the DOM that impact add-ons:</p>
<h3 id="Selection_changes">Selection changes</h3>
<p>In the past, {{ domxref("Document.getSelection()") }} was returning a stringified version of the selection instead of the {{ domxref("Selection") }} object itself. This was non-standard behavior, and has been corrected.</p>
<h3 id="Potential_name_conflicts">Potential name conflicts</h3>
<p>When the DOM File API was added, a new global called {{ domxref("File") }} was added; this can conflict with objects in your scripts. If you have any globals called <code>File</code>, you should rename them.</p>
<p>Similarly, a new global, {{ domxref("ChromeWorker") }}, was introduced to support allowing Workers to be used from chrome code. If by some chance you have any globals with this name, you should rename them.</p>
<h2 id="Security_changes">Security changes</h2>
<p>Support for SSL 2.0 has been removed. This shouldn't affect any current add-ons. However, for reference, some very old code was removed, as well as support for the preferences <code>security.enable_ssl2</code> (which is false by default), and all preferences starting with "<code>security.ssl2.</code>"</p>
