## Changes for add-on developers

- Support provided for `page_action` as a {{WebExtAPIRef("menus.ContextType")}} in the {{WebExtAPIRef("menus")}} API for Manifest V3 extensions. This provides Manifest V3 extensions the same ability as Manifest V2 extensions to add menu items to `page_action`. ([Firefox bug 1951166](https://bugzil.la/1951166))
- The {{WebExtAPIRef("contextualIdentities")}} API is no longer defined in Firefox for Android. Previously, it was defined but defective. ([Firefox bug 1659500](https://bugzil.la/1659500))
- The `contextualIdentities` permission is now not recognized on Firefox for Android. Previously, it enabled a broken version of the "containers" feature. ([Firefox bug 1659500](https://bugzil.la/1659500))
- The new Manifest V3 version of the {{WebExtAPIRef("userScripts")}} API is now available on Firefox for Android. ([Firefox bug 1949955](https://bugzil.la/1949955))
