## Changes for add-on developers

- Support added for `unspecified` in {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies.SameSiteStatus")}}. In addition, `unspecified` is now the default value for `sameSite` in {{WebExtAPIRef("cookies.set()")}}. ([Firefox bug 1550032](https://bugzil.la/1550032))

### Removals

### Other

## Experimental web features

These features are shipping in Firefox 140 but are disabled by default. To experiment with them, search for the appropriate preference on the `about:config` page and set it to `true`. You can find more such features on the [Experimental features](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Experimental_features) page.

- **`Notification.maxActions`** (Nightly): `dom.webnotifications.actions.enabled`

  The [`Notification.maxActions`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification/maxActions_static) static property returns the maximum number of actions that can be associated with a `Notification`, as set using {{domxref("ServiceWorkerRegistration.showNotification()")}}.
  This was prematurely released in Firefox version 138, and this change makes it available only in the Nightly build ([Firefox bug 1963263](https://bugzil.la/1963263)).
