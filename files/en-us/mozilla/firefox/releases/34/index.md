### CSS

- Our experimental implementation of CSS Fonts Level 3 progresses. Newly implemented features are:

  - the fallback algorithm of {{cssxref("font-variant-position")}}, creating synthetic alternates for missing glyphs, based on the subscript and superscript metrics supplied by the font ({{bug(1024804)}}).
  - The `layout.css.font-features.enabled` preference has been removed, meaning the following properties have been activated by default:

    - The CSS Font Level 3 version of {{cssxref("font-variant")}} which is now a shorthand property.
    - The longhand properties {{cssxref("font-variant-caps")}}, {{cssxref("font-variant-numeric")}}, {{cssxref("font-variant-position")}}, {{cssxref("font-variant-east-asian")}}, {{cssxref("font-variant-ligatures")}}, and {{cssxref("font-variant-alternates")}}.
    - The properties {{cssxref("font-kerning")}} and {{cssxref("font-synthesis")}}
    - The properties {{cssxref("font-feature-settings")}} and {{cssxref("font-language-override")}} are unprefixed. The prefixed version are still available for some time to ease transition.

- The value `auto` has been added to {{cssxref("min-width")}} and {{cssxref("min-height")}} with a different behavior than the last time ({{bug(984711)}} and {{bug(1015474)}}).
- An experimental implementation, disabled by default, of the filter functional values of the {{cssxref("filter")}} property have been implemented. It is controlled by the `layout.css.filters.enabled` pref ({{bug(948265)}}).
- Fixed starting of CSS transitions that start together with changes to {{cssxref("display")}}, {{cssxref("position")}}, {{cssxref("overflow")}}, and similar properties ({{bug(625289)}})

### HTML

_No change._

### JavaScript

- The ES2015 syntax for [computed property names on object literals](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#computed_property_names) has been implemented ({{bug(924688)}}).

  - This includes [getter](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/get) and [setter](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/set) method names as well ({{bug(1048384)}}) and can also be used with [destructuring](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment#computed_object_property_names_and_destructuring).

- The ES2015[ shorthand syntax for defining methods](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions) on objects has been implemented ({{bug(924672)}}).
- The ES2015 `Object` method {{jsxref("Object.assign", "Object.assign()")}} has been implemented ({{bug(937855)}}).
- ES2015 [template strings](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) and the {{jsxref("String.raw()")}} method are now supported ({{bug(1038259)}}, {{bug(1039774)}}).
- A new ES2015 object {{jsxref("WeakSet")}} has been added ({{bug(792439)}}).
- ES2015 [Symbols](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) (only available in the Nightly channel) have been updated to conform with recent specification changes ({{bug(1042602)}}):

  - When trying to convert a symbol to a number, a [`TypeError`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypeError) will be thrown now.
  - When using loose equality, `Object(sym) == sym` returns `true` now.

- The experimental {{jsxref("TypedArray.prototype.move()")}} method (only available in former Nightly and Aurora channels) has been replaced with the now implemented standard ES2015 {{jsxref("TypedArray.prototype.copyWithin()")}} method ({{bug(1021379)}}).
- In [strict mode](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode), setting a [duplicate property name in object literals](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#duplicate_property_names) will no longer throw a `SyntaxError` as per ES2015 specification ({{bug(1041128)}}).
- In regular expressions (including `String.replace`), the matched text for a capturing group is now `undefined` instead of the empty string when that capturing group didn't get consulted because quantifiers prevented its exercise (see {{bug(369778)}} and [this example code](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp#gecko_specific_notes)). Note that due to web compatibility, RegExp.$N will still return an empty string ({{bug(1053944)}}).
- The ES2015 [spread operator](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax) is now supported in [destructuring](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) ({{bug(933276)}}).
- [Destructuring](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) now uses iterator protocol instead of array-like protocol ({{bug(933276)}}).
- {{jsxref("Proxy.revocable()")}} has been implemented ({{bug(978279)}}).

### Interfaces/APIs/DOM

- The {{domxref("Element.matches()")}} method has been added; it does what the non-standard `mozMatchesSelector()` was doing ({{bug(886308)}}).
- The {{domxref("Performance.now()")}} method is now available to Web workers ({{bug(908390)}}).
- The non-standard interface `MozNamedAttrMap` has been renamed to the standard {{domxref("NamedNodeMap")}} and {{domxref("Element.attributes")}} has been adapted to use it ({{bug(1055467)}}).
- The {{domxref("Path2D.addPath()")}} method has been added ({{bug(985801)}}).
- The non-standard [Device Storage API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Device_Storage_API) is now also enabled for privileged apps installed on Android ({{bug(886627)}}).
- Web Crypto API has been enabled by default ({{bug(1074001)}}).
- The {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.stop()")}} method has been added ({{bug(1057955)}}).
- Our experimental implementation of EME continues. The {{domxref("MediaKeySession.getUsableKeyIds()")}} method has been added ({{bug(1057171)}}).
- Regarding [WebRTC](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API):

  - an experiment implementation of {{domxref("RTPSender")}} and {{domxref("RTPReceiver")}} working with {{domxref("RTCPeerConnection")}} has landed ({{bug(1032835)}}).
  - application window sharing has been added to {{domxref("Navigation.getUserMedia()")}} ({{bug(1036653)}}) and {{domxref("MediaTrackConstraintSet")}} now supports `browserWindow` and `scrollWithPage` allowing to chose the tab of a window that has to be shared without showing the tab chooser dialog ({{bug(1041700)}}).
  - `"browser"` is now an accepted value of MediaSourceEnum, used to define constraints ({{bug(1041493)}}).

- For Web Components, event retargeting is now implemented ({{bug(887541)}}).
- The {{domxref("Headers")}} interface has been implemented ({{bug(1029620)}}). It is controlled by the `dom.fetch.enabled` preference which is set to `false` by default.
- Regarding our experimental implementation of Web Animations, the {{domxref("AnimationEffect")}} interface has been added, with the single {{domxref("AnimationEffect.name")}} property ({{bug(1045993)}}). Web Animations is not activated by default and is controlled by the `dom.animations-api.core.enabled` preference.
- CSSOM View smooth scrolling methods have been added: {{domxref("Window.scroll()")}}, {{domxref("Window.scrollTo()")}}, and {{domxref("Window.scrollBy()")}} ({{bug(1022818)}}).
- The non-standard `MozSmsSegmentInfo` is no more visible on the global object {{bug(916607)}}.

### Add-on SDK
