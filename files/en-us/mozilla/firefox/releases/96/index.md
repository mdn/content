### HTTP

- Cookies sent from the same domain but using different schemes (for example http or https) are now considered to be from different sites with respect to the cookie [SameSite](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite) directive.
  In addition, cookies are assumed to implicitly set `SameSite=Lax` if the `SameSite` attribute is not specified (previously the default was `SameSite=None`), and cookies with `SameSite=None` require a secure context. ({{bug(1617609)}}).

### APIs

- {{domxref("navigator.canShare()")}} is now supported on Android, allowing code to check whether {{domxref("navigator.share()")}} will succeed for particular targets.
  The feature is behind a preference on desktop operating systems.
