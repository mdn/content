## Changes for add-on developers

- The {{WebExtAPIRef("commands.onCommand")}} event now passes the `tab` argument to the event listener. This enables extensions to apply a triggered shortcut to the page in which it was issued, without the need to call the `tabs.query()` method ([Firefox bug 1843866](https://bugzil.la/1843866)).
- The {{WebExtAPIRef("runtime.MessageSender")}} type now includes the `origin` property. This enables message or connection requests to see the page or frame that opened the connection. This is useful for identifying if the origin can be trusted if it isn't apparent from the URL ([Firefox bug 1787379](https://bugzil.la/1787379)).

## Experimental web features

These features are newly shipped in Firefox 126 but are disabled by default. To experiment with them, search for the appropriate preference on the `about:config` page and set it to `true`. You can find more such features on the [Experimental features](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Experimental_features) page.
