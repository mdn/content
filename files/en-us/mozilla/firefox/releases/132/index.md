This article provides information about the changes in Firefox 132 that affect developers. Firefox 132 is the current [Beta version of Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/#beta) and ships on [October 29, 2024](https://whattrainisitnow.com/release/?version=132).

## Changes for web developers

### Developer Tools

### HTML

#### Removals

### CSS

- The {{CSSXRef("text-emphasis-position")}} property now supports the `auto` value to bring it inline with {{CSSXRef("text-underline-position")}} ([Firefox bug 1919658](https://bugzil.la/1919658)).

#### Removals

- The [`-moz-user-modify`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-modify) CSS property has been removed. This property has been deprecated in favour of the [`contenteditable`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/contenteditable) global attribute. ([Firefox bug 1920118](https://bugzil.la/1920118)).

### JavaScript

- The [JSON parse with source proposal](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-json-parse-with-source) is now supported, which aims to provide features to mitigate issues around loss of precision when converting values such as large floats and date values between JavaScript values and JSON text ([Firefox bug 1913085](https://bugzil.la/1913085)). Specifically, the following features are now available:
  - The `JSON.parse()` [`reviver` parameter `context` argument](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#the_reviver_parameter): Provides access to the original JSON source text that was parsed.
  - [`JSON.isRawJSON()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/isRawJSON): Tests whether a value is an object returned by `JSON.rawJSON()`.
  - [`JSON.rawJSON()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/rawJSON): Creates a "raw JSON" object containing a piece of JSON text, which can then be included in an object to preserve the specified value when that object is stringified.

#### Removals

### SVG

#### Removals

### HTTP

#### Removals

- HTTP/2 Server Push is deactivated by default with the preference `network.http.http2.allow-push` now set to `false`.
  This feature is no longer supported by any other major browser, and the implementation may be completely removed in a future release. ([Firefox bug 1915848](https://bugzil.la/1915848)).

### Security

#### Removals

### Privacy

- All [third-party cookies](/en-US/docs/Web/Privacy/Third-party_cookies) are now blocked in [Strict Enhanced Tracking Protection](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/enhanced-tracking-protection-firefox-desktop#w_strict-enhanced-tracking-protection). ([Firefox bug 1918037](https://bugzil.la/1918037)).

### APIs

- The {{domxref('WebGLRenderingContext.drawingBufferColorSpace', 'drawingBufferColorSpace')}} and {{domxref('WebGLRenderingContext.unpackColorSpace','unpackColorSpace')}} properties of the {{domxref('WebGLRenderingContext')}} and {{domxref('WebGL2RenderingContext')}} interfaces are now supported. These specify the color space of the WebGL drawing buffer, and the color space to convert to when importing textures, respectively. ([Firefox bug 1885491](https://bugzil.la/1885491), [Firefox bug 1885446](https://bugzil.la/1885446)).
- The {{domxref("Notification.silent")}} property is now supported, which controls whether system notifications should be silent. When `silent: true` is specified in the {{domxref("Notification.Notification", "Notification()")}} constructor, the resulting system notification is issued without accompanying sounds or vibrations, regardless of device settings ([Firefox bug 1809028](https://bugzil.la/1809028)).

#### DOM

#### Media, WebRTC, and Web Audio

- The {{domxref('HTMLVideoElement/requestVideoFrameCallback','requestVideoFrameCallback()')}} and {{domxref('HTMLVideoElement/cancelVideoFrameCallback','cancelVideoFrameCallback()')}} methods of the {{domxref('HTMLVideoElement')}} interface are now supported. The `requestVideoFrameCallback()` registers a callback function that runs when a new video frame is sent to the compositor. Developers can use this function to perform operations on each video frame, enabling more efficient painting to a canvas, video analysis, synchronization with external audio sources, and so on. The method returns a callback handle that can be passed to `cancelVideoFrameCallback()` in order to cancel the outstanding callback request. ([Firefox bug 1919367](https://bugzil.la/1919367), [Firefox bug 1800882](https://bugzil.la/1800882)).
- The {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.getCapabilities()")}} method is now supported. This returns an object detailing the accepted values or value range for each constrainable property of the associated {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}} ([Firefox bug 1179084](https://bugzil.la/1179084)).

#### Removals

### WebAssembly

#### Removals

### WebDriver conformance (WebDriver BiDi, Marionette)

#### WebDriver BiDi

- Implemented several improvements to make WebDriver BiDi commands more reliable when used during navigation or with newly created tabs. Previously commands such as `browsingContext.setViewport` were likely to fail due to an `AbortError`, they will now be retried a few times to avoid such issues. ([Firefox bug 1854942](https://bugzil.la/1854942), [Firefox bug 1918287](https://bugzil.la/1918287), [Firefox bug 1918672](https://bugzil.la/1918672), [Firefox bug 1921756](https://bugzil.la/1921756))
- The `browsingContext.contextCreated` event is now correctly emitted for lazy-loaded frames. Previously the event would only be emitted when the iframe actually started loading its content. ([Firefox bug 1878166](https://bugzil.la/1878166))
- Network events are now correctly emitted for cached stylesheet requests. ([Firefox bug 1879438](https://bugzil.la/1879438))
- Network event timings were previously using the wrong unit and were provided in microseconds. They are now correctly set in milliseconds. ([Firefox bug 1916685](https://bugzil.la/1916685))
- The `requestTime` from network event timings should now be more accurate and really match the time where the request actually started. ([Firefox bug 1922390](https://bugzil.la/1922390))

## Changes for add-on developers

### Removals

### Other

## Experimental web features

These features are newly shipped in Firefox 132 but are disabled by default. To experiment with them, search for the appropriate preference on the `about:config` page and set it to `true`. You can find more such features on the [Experimental features](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Experimental_features) page.

- **Cookie Store API:** `dom.cookieStore.enabled`.

  The [Cookie Store API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cookie_Store_API) is a modern, {{jsxref("Promise")}}-based method of managing cookies that does not block the event loop and does not rely on {{domxref("Document")}} (it can therefore be made available to [service workers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API)). As of Firefox 132, a subset of the Cookie Store API has been implemented. ([Firefox bug 1800882](https://bugzil.la/1800882)). This includes:

  - The [`CookieStore`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieStore) interface, but `partitioned` is not included in return values.
  - The [`CookieChangeEvent`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/CookieChangeEvent) interface, excluding `partitioned` properties.
  - The [`Window.cookieStore`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/cookieStore) property.
  - The [`ServiceWorkerGlobalScope.cookieStore`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerGlobalScope/cookieStore) property.

- **The `fetch()` `keepalive` option:** `dom.fetchKeepalive.enabled`.

  The global {{domxref('Window.fetch','fetch()')}} method has a [`keepalive`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/RequestInit#keepalive) initialization option. When `keepalive` is set to `true`, the browser will not abort the associated request if the page that initiated it is unloaded before the request is complete.

  This enables a fetch request to function as an alternative to {{domxref("Navigator.sendBeacon()")}} when sending analytics at the end of a session, which has some advantages (you can use HTTP methods other than [`POST`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST), customize request properties, and access the server response via the fetch {{jsxref("Promise")}} fulfillment). It is also available in [service workers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API). ([Firefox bug 1906952](https://bugzil.la/1906952)).

- **`Promise.try()`**: <code>javascript.options.experimental.promise_try</code>. {{jsxref("Promise.try()")}} is a convenience method that takes a callback of any kind (returns or throws, synchronously or asynchronously) and wraps its result in a {{jsxref("Promise")}} so that promise semantics (e.g. {{jsxref("Promise.then", ".then()")}}, {{jsxref("Promise.catch", ".catch()")}}) can be used to handle it ([Firefox bug 1905364](https://bugzil.la/1905364)).
