## Changes for web developers

### Developer Tools

- The `cd()` [web console helper function](/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Helpers), which was deprecated in Firefox 74, has now been removed. The `<iframe>` context picker tool described in [Working with iframes](/en-US/docs/Tools/Working_with_iframes) serves the same purpose, but is much better! For more information see {{bug(1607741)}}.
- The different {{cssxref("margin")}} and {{cssxref("padding")}} shorthand and longhand properties are now marked as inactive on internal table elements because they have no effect on them. ({{bug(1551569)}}).
- The {{cssxref("order")}} property was previously incorrectly marked as inactive for grid items. This got fixed in {{bug(1579017)}}.

### HTML

_No changes._

### SVG

- SVG filters can now use the {{SVGElement("feComposite")}} element with the [`lighter` operator](/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/operator#fecomposite) ({{bug(1518099)}}). This operator sums the pixels of two source graphics.

### CSS

- The {{cssxref(":autofill")}} pseudo-class is now enabled, with `-webkit-autofill` as an alias ({{bug(1685675)}}) and ({{bug(1475316)}}).
- The {{cssxref("list-style-image")}} property now accepts any valid {{cssxref("image")}} ({{bug(1685078)}}).

### JavaScript

- The [`Intl.DisplayNames`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DisplayNames) built-in object has been enabled by default. This enables the consistent translation of language, region, and script display names:

  ```js
  // Get English currency code display names
  let currencyNames = new Intl.DisplayNames(['en'], {type: 'currency'});
  // Get currency names
  currencyNames.of('USD'); // "US Dollar"
  currencyNames.of('EUR'); // "Euro"
  ```

  For more information see {{bug(1654116)}}.

### APIs

#### DOM

- [`Window.name`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/name) is now reset to an empty string if a tab loads a page from a different domain, and restored if the original page is reloaded (e.g. by selecting the "back" button). This prevents an untrusted page from accessing any information that the previous page might have stored in the property (potentially the new page might also modify such data, which might then be read by the original page if it was reloaded). For more information see {{bug(1685089)}}.
- [`EventTarget.addEventListener()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) now supports the `signal` option. This option allows an [`AbortSignal`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortSignal) to be passed to the method. The `AbortSignal` can later be used to remove the listener by calling `abort()`. For more information see {{bug(1679204)}}.

### WebDriver conformance (Marionette)

- Updated `WebDriver:ElementClick` to synthesize a `mousemove` event before the actual `click` event ({{bug(1684002)}}).

#### Known bugs

- WebDriver commands following a call to `WebDriver:SwitchToFrame` can fail with a "no such window" error
  if the frame's content hasn't yet finished loading ({{bug(1691348)}}).
- After a [cross-group
  page navigation](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/dom/navigation/nav_replace.html#cross-group-navigations), accessing a previously-retrieved element might not always raise a "stale element" error, and
  can also lead to a "no such element" error. To prevent this, set the `marionette.actors.enabled`
  preference to `false` ({{bug(1690308)}}).

#### Removals

- Removed support for the deprecated `Marionette:ActionChain` and `Marionette:MultiAction` commands ({{bug(1683755)}}).

## Changes for add-on developers

- [Host permissions](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/permissions#host_permissions) now grant access to privileged parts of the [tabs API](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs) ({{bug(1679688)}}).
- `focused: false` is now ignored when set as an option in a [`windows.create()`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/windows/create) call ({{bug(1253129)}}).
- {{WebExtAPIRef("identity.getRedirectURL")}} now supports a loopback address, see [Getting the redirect URL](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/identity#getting_the_redirect_url) for details ({{bug(1614919)}}).
