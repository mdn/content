## Changes for web developers

### Developer Tools

#### Console

- Network messages with response codes in the 400-499 and 500-599 ranges are now considered errors, and are displayed [even if Response or XHR filters are disabled](/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Console_messages#filtering_by_category). ({{bug(1635460)}})
- Network messages for requests that are blocked (by the browser or an extension) are now styled with a "prohibited" icon in the [Console](/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Console_messages). ({{bug(1629875)}})

#### Debugger

- ["Blackbox" a source file](/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/How_to/Ignore_a_source) is now called "ignore" a source file.  ({{bug(1642811)}})
- Inline preview is now available on [exceptions](/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/How_to/Breaking_on_exceptions). ({{bug(1581708)}})
- Items in the Watch Expressions and Scopes sections now have tooltips on hover, showing their values ({{bug(1631545)}})
- In the [Call Stack section](/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/UI_Tour#call_stack), there is now a context menu option to **Restart Frame**, to execute the current stack frame from its beginning. ({{bug(1594467)}})

#### Other tools

- The new [Application panel](/en-US/docs/Tools/Application) is now available, which initially provides inspection and debugging support for [service workers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) and [web app manifests](/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest).
- The Messages tab of the Network Monitor has been merged with the [Responses tab](/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor/request_details#response_tab). ({{bug(1636421)}})
- The Accessibility Inspector is automatically turned on when you access its tab; you no longer need to explicitly enable it. ({{bug(1602075)}})
- In [Responsive Design Mode](/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode#controlling_responsive_design_mode), when touch simulation is enabled, mouse-drag events are now interpreted as touch-drag or swipe events. ({{bug(1621781)}})
- When [remote debugging](/en-US/docs/Tools/about:debugging#connecting_to_a_remote_device), the URL bar now has **Back** and **Forward** buttons to help with navigation on the remote browser. ({{bug(1639425)}})

### HTML

- The [`<iframe>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe) element's `sandbox` attribute now supports the `allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation` token ({{bug(1359867)}}).
- Setting `target="_blank"` on [`<a>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a) and [`<area>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/area) elements implicitly provides the same behavior as also setting `rel="noopener"` ({{bug(1522083)}}).

### CSS

- External style sheets are now cached per document group ({{bug(1599160)}}). Firefox will minimize retrieval and revalidation of cached style sheets when navigating pages on the same origin. A simple reload (for example, `F5`) will not revalidate the cached CSS files. To load current versions of the style sheets, reload the page bypassing the cache (`Cmd`/`Ctrl` + `F5`).

#### Removals

- The [`prefers-color-scheme`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) media feature's `no-preference` value has been removed from the [media queries spec](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#descdef-media-prefers-color-scheme), and from Firefox ({{bug(1643656)}}).

### JavaScript

- {{jsxref("SharedArrayBuffer")}} has been re-enabled in a post-Spectre-safe manner. It is available to cross-origin isolated sites ({{bug(1619649)}}).

  - To cross-origin isolate your site, you need to set the new {{HTTPHeader("Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy")}} (COEP) and {{HTTPHeader("Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy")}} (COOP) headers.

- {{jsxref("Promise.any()")}} is now available ({{bug(1599769)}}).
- {{jsxref("WeakRef")}} objects have been implemented ({{bug(1639246)}}).
- [Logical assignment operators](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-logical-assignment) are now supported ({{bug(1639591)}})

  - [Logical nullish assignment (`??=`)](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_nullish_assignment)
  - [Logical AND assignment (`&&=`)](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_AND_assignment)
  - [Logical OR assignment (`||=`)](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_OR_assignment)

- {{jsxref("Atomics")}} objects now also work with non-shared memory ({{bug(1630706)}}).
- The [`Intl.DateTimeFormat()` constructor ](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat)now supports the `dateStyle` and `timeStyle` options ({{bug(1557718)}}).
- The [`Intl.NumberFormat()` constructor ](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat)now supports more numbering systems ({{bug(1413504)}}).

### HTTP

- Cross-origin isolation has been implemented using the new {{HTTPHeader("Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy")}} (COEP) and {{HTTPHeader("Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy")}} (COOP) headers. This allows you to access certain features such as {{jsxref("SharedArrayBuffer")}} objects and unthrottled timers in {{domxref("Performance.now()")}}.

### APIs

#### DOM

- The [`FileReader`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader) interface's [`loadstart` event](/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader/loadstart_event) is now dispatched asynchronously, as per the spec ({{bug(1502403)}}).
- {{domxref("CanvasPattern.setTransform()")}} now supports a {{domxref("DOMMatrix")}} object as an input parameter, as well as an {{domxref("SVGMatrix")}} object ({{bug(1565997)}}).

#### Media, WebRTC, and Web Audio

- Firefox now supports remote timestamps on statistics records whose {{domxref("RTCStatsType")}} is `remote-outbound-rtp`. The {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats")}} dictionary which is used to provide these statistics now includes the {{domxref("RTCRemoteOutboundRtpStreamStats.remoteTimestamp", "remoteTimestamp")}} property, which states the timestamp on the remote peer at which the statistics were collected or generated ({{bug(1615191)}}).

#### Removals

- A number of internal Gecko events — including `DOMWindowClose` — which were accidentally exposed to the web, are now internal-only as intended ({{bug(1557407)}}).

### WebAssembly

- [WebAssembly Bulk memory operations](/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format#bulk_memory_operations) are now shipped ({{bug(1528294)}}).
- [WebAssembly Reference types](/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format#reference_types) are now shipped ({{bug(1637884)}}).
- [WebAssembly Threads](/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Understanding_the_text_format#webassembly_threads) (Shared memory & Atomics) are now shipped ({{bug(1389458)}}, {{bug(1648685)}}).

## Changes for add-on developers

- New API: [`tabs.warmup()`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/tabs/warmup) ([bug 1402256](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1402256))
- [Storage quotas are now enforced for the `sync` storage area](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/sync#storage_quotas_for_sync_data) ([bug 1634615](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1634615)) ([addons.mozilla.org blog post](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2020/07/09/changes-to-storage-sync-in-firefox-79/))
