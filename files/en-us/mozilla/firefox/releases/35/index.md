## Changes for Web developers

### Developer Tools

- ["Show DOM Properties" from the Page Inspector](/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector#element_popup_menu_2)

### CSS

- The {{cssxref("mask-type")}} property has been activated by default ({{bug(1058519)}}).
- The {{cssxref("filter")}} property is now activated by default ({{bug(1057180)}}).
- The {{cssxref("@font-face")}} at-rule now supports WOFF2 fonts ({{bug(1064737)}}).
- The {{cssxref("symbols()")}} functional notation is now supported ({{bug(966168)}}).
- The CSS Font Loading API has been implemented ({{bug(1028497)}}).
- Using `-moz-appearance` with the `none` value on a combobox now remove the dropdown button ({{bug(649849)}}).
- The property accessor `element.style["css-property-name"]` has been added to match other browsers ({{bug(958887)}}).

### HTML

- The obsolete and non-conforming `bottommargin`, `leftmargin`, `rightmargin` and `topmargin` attributes of the {{HTMLElement("body")}} element have been activated in non-quirks mode ({{bug(95530)}}).

### JavaScript

- The "[temporal dead zone](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#temporal_dead_zone_and_errors_with_let)" for [`let`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let) declarations has been implemented. In conformance with ES2015 `let` semantics, the following situations now throw errors. See also this[ newsgroup announcement](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.platform/tezdW299Zds) and {{bug(1001090)}}.

  - Redeclaring existing variables or arguments using `let` within the same scope in function bodies is now a syntax error.
  - Using a variable declared using `let` in function bodies before the declaration is reached and evaluated is now a runtime error.

- ES2015 {{jsxref("Global_Objects/Symbol", "Symbols")}} (only available in the Nightly channel) have been updated to conform with recent specification changes:

  - `String(Symbol("1"))` now no longer throws a {{jsxref("TypeError")}}; instead a string (`"Symbol(1)"`) gets returned ({{bug(1058396)}}).

- The various [_TypedArray_ constructors](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray#typedarray_objects) now have as their `[[Prototype]]` a single function, denoted `%TypedArray%`  in ES2015 (but otherwise not directly exposed).  Each typed array prototype now inherits from `%TypedArray%.prototype`.  (`%TypedArray%` and `%TypedArray%.prototype` inherit from [`Function.prototype`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) and [`Object.prototype`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object), respectively, so that typed array constructors and instances still have the properties found on those objects.)  Typed array function properties now reside on `%TypedArray%.prototype` and work on any typed array.  See [_TypedArray_](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray#description) and {{bug(896116)}} for more information.
- ES2015 semantics for [prototype mutations using object literals](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Object_initializer#prototype_mutation) have been implemented ({{bug(1061853)}}).

  - Now only a single member notated as `__proto__:value` will mutate the `[[Prototype]]` in the object literal syntax.
  - Method members like `__proto__() {}` will not overwrite the `[[Prototype]]` anymore.

### Interfaces/APIs/DOM

- The {{domxref("Navigator", "NavigatorLanguage")}} interface is now available to workers on {{domxref("WorkerNavigator")}} ({{bug(925849)}}).
- The {{domxref("Element.closest()")}} method returns the closest ancestor of the current element ({{bug(1055533)}}).
- Experimental support for the {{domxref("CanvasRenderingContext2D.filter")}} property has been added behind the `canvas.filters.enabled` flag ({{bug(927892)}}).
- Our experimental implementation of Web Animations progresses with the landing of the `Animation.target` property. This always is behind the `dom.animations-api.core.enabled` pref, off by default ({{bug(1067701)}}).
- The {{domxref("Element.hasAttributes", "hasAttributes()")}} method has been moved from {{domxref("Node")}} to {{domxref("Element")}} as required by the spec ({{bug("1055773")}}).
- The `crossOrigin` reflected attribute of {{domxref("HTMLImageElement")}}, {{domxref("HTMLLinkElement")}}, {{domxref("HTMLMediaElement")}}, {{domxref("HTMLScriptElement")}}, and {{domxref("SVGScriptElement")}} only accepts valid values, and `""` isn't, `null` has to be used instead ({{bug(880997)}}).
- The Resource Timing API has been activated by default ({{bug(1002855)}}).
- To match the spec, the first argument of {{domxref("Selection.containsNode()")}} cannot be `null` anymore ({{bug(1068058)}}).
- The new {{domxref("ImageCapture")}} API has been implemented: {{domxref("ImageCapture.takePhoto()")}} is available ({{bug(916643)}}).
- Non-HTTP {{domxref("XMLHttpRequest")}} requests now return `200` in case of success (instead of the erroneous `0`) ({{bug(716491)}}).
- {{domxref("XMLHttpRequest.responseURL")}} has been adapted to the latest spec and doesn't include the fragment (`'#xyz'`) of the URL, if relevant ({{bug(1073882)}}).
- The internal, non-standard, `File.mozFullPath` property is no more visible from content ({{bug(1048293)}}).
- The constructor of {{domxref("File")}} has been extended to match the specification ({{bug(1047483)}}).
- An experimental implementation of `AbortablePromise`, a promise that can be aborted by a different entity that the one who created it, has been added. It is prefixed with `Moz` and controlled by the `dom.abortablepromise.enabled`property, defaulting to `false` ({{bug(1035060)}}).
- The non-standard {{domxref("Navigator.mozIsLocallyAvailable")}} property has been removed ({{bug(1066826)}}).
- The preference `network.websocket.enabled,` `true` by default, has been removed; [Websocket](/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) API cannot be deactivated anymore ({{bug(1091016)}}).
- The non-standard methods and properties of {{domxref("Crypto")}} have been removed ({{bug(1030963)}}). Only methods and properties defined in the standard WebCrypto API are left.
- Our experimental implementation of WebGL 2.0 is going forward!

  - The {{domxref("WebGL2RenderingContext.copyBufferSubData()")}} method has been implemented ({{bug(1048668)}}).

### MathML

- The `dtls` OpenType feature (via the CSS {{cssxref("font-feature-settings")}} on the default stylesheet) is now applied automatically to MathML elements when positioning scripts over it (e.g. dotless i with mathematical hat).

### SVG

_No change._

### Audio/Video

_No change._

## Network & Security

- HTTP/2 has been implemented and activated, with AEAD ciphers only ({{bug(1027720)}}) and ({{bug('1047594')}}).
- The HTTP/2 `alt-svc` header is now supported ({{bug(1003448)}}).
- The [Public Key Pinning](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Public_Key_Pinning) Extension for HTTP (HPKP) has been implemented ({{bug(787133)}}).
- The [CSP](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) 1.1 `base-uri` [directive](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) is now supported ({{bug(1045897)}}).
- Path of the source is now considered too when host-source matching happens in [CSP](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP) ({{bug(808292)}}).

## Changes for add-on and Mozilla developers

### XUL & Add-ons

- The private `_getTabForBrowser()` method on the `<xul:tabbrowser>` element has been deprecated. In its place, we've added a new, public, method called `getTabForBrowser`. This returns, predictably, the `<xul:tab>` element that contains the specified `<xul:browser>`.
- `Components.utils.now()`, matching {{domxref("Performance.now()")}} has been implemented for non-window chrome code ({{bug(969490)}}).

### Add-on SDK

#### Highlights

- Added access keys for context menu.
- Removed `isPrivateBrowsing` from `BrowserWindow`.
- Added `toJSON` method to `URL` instances.
