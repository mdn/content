This article provides information about the changes in Firefox 64 that will affect developers. Firefox 64 was released on December 11, 2018.

## Changes for web developers

### Developer tools

- The [Accessibility info-bar](/en-US/docs/Tools/Accessibility_inspector#highlighting_of_ui_items) has been enhanced to include information about the color contrast ratio of text or images on the page ({{bug(1473037)}}).
- [Responsive Design Mode](/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode) device selection is now saved between sessions ({{bug(1248619)}}).
- Resources that are potentially affected by [Tracking Protection](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Privacy/Tracking_Protection) are now indicated in the [Network Monitor](/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor) ({{bug(1333994)}}).
- The [Web Console](/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console) got improvements around entering and evaluating code:

  - [Autocomplete](/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console/The_command_line_interpreter#autocomplete) for Console expressions is now case-insensitive ({{bug(672733)}}).
  - You can now step through the [Console expression history](/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console/The_command_line_interpreter#command_history) with bash-like reverse search ({{bug(1024913)}}).
  - [Evaluated code](/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console/The_command_line_interpreter) in the Console is now syntax-highlighted in both the input and output ({{bug(1463669)}}).

- Stepping in the [JavaScript Debugger](/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger) also had some improvements:

  - [Stepping out](/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/How_to/Step_through_code) of a function in the Debugger now skips the return value ({{bug(923975)}}).

#### Removals

- The Developer Tools GCLI has been removed ({{bug(1429421)}}).

### HTML

_No changes._

### CSS

- [CSS Scrollbars](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scrollbars) spec functionality has been enabled by default ({{bug(1492012)}}).
- Interaction Media Features implemented, including [`pointer:coarse`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/pointer) ({{bug(1035774)}}). For [`any-pointer`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/any-pointer) and [`any-hover`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/any-hover) implementation, see {{bug(1483111)}}.
- The [`prefers-reduced-motion`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion) media feature is now supported in Firefox for Android ({{bug(1478505)}}).
- CSS {{cssxref("&lt;gradient&gt;")}} values now support multi-position color stop syntax, e.g. `yellow 25%, yellow 50%` can now be written `yellow 25% 50%` ({{bug(1352643)}}).
- The {{cssxref("text-transform")}} property now accepts the `full-size-kana` value ({{bug(1498148)}}).
- Support added for {{cssxref("appearance", "-webkit-appearance")}} to alleviate associated web compat issues ({{bug(1368555)}}).
- Closely associated with the above update, we've also removed most of the Firefox-specific `-moz-appearance` values ({{bug(1496720)}}).
- {{cssxref("display")}}: `list-item` is now supported on {{htmlelement("legend")}} elements ({{bug(1486602)}}).
- SVG `path()`s, as usable in {{cssxref("offset-path")}}, are now animatable ({{bug(1486094)}}).
- If a selector chain or group includes a `-webkit-`prefixed pseudo-element, that pseudo-element no longer invalidates it (see {{bug(1424106)}} for the details, and {{bug(1486325)}} for enabling this feature).

#### Removals

- The non-standard [`-moz-box` and `-moz-inline-box`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Gecko/Chrome/CSS/display-xul) {{CSSxRef("display")}} values have been hidden from web content ({{bug(1496961)}}).
- The non-standard {{CSSxRef("::-moz-tree")}} [pseudo-elements](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-elements) have been hidden from web content ({{bug(1496961)}}).
- The `layout.css.filters.enabled` preference has been removed; [CSS filters](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Filter_Effects) can no longer be disabled ({{bug(1408841)}}).
- A previous change — to swap the values of the 2-value {{cssxref("overflow")}} syntax so block is specified first and inline second ({{bug(1481866)}}) — has been reverted ({{bug(1492567)}}). See [Bug 1481866 comment 14](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1481866#c14) for why.

### SVG

_No changes._

### JavaScript

- The TC39 [Well-formed JSON.stringify](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-well-formed-stringify) proposal has been implemented, to prevent {{jsxref("JSON.stringify")}} from returning ill-formed Unicode strings ({{bug(1469021)}}).
- Proxied functions can now be passed to {{jsxref("Function.prototype.toString")}}`.call()` ({{bug(1440468)}}).
- In the {{jsxref("WebAssembly.Global")}} constructor, if no value is specified a typed 0 value is used. This is specified by the [`DefaultValue` algorithm](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/js-api/#defaultvalue) ({{bug(1490286)}}).

### APIs

#### DOM

- A number of changes related to the {{domxref("Fullscreen_API", "Fullscreen API", "", "1")}} have been implemented:

  - The API has been unprefixed ({{bug(1269276)}}).
  - The {{domxref("Element.requestFullscreen()")}} and {{domxref("Document.exitFullscreen()")}} methods both now return a {{jsxref("Promise")}}, which is resolved when the mode change is complete ({{bug(1188256)}} and {{bug(1491212)}}).
  - Previously, {{domxref("fullscreenchange")}} and {{domxref("fullscreenerror")}} events were dispatched to the {{domxref("Document")}} first, then the {{domxref("Element")}}. This has been reversed so that the element gets the event first. This matches the latest specification as well as the behavior of Google Chrome ({{bug(1375319)}}).

- The {{domxref("WebVR_API", "WebVR API", "", "1")}} (1.1) is now re-enabled in macOS ({{bug(1476091)}}).
- {{domxref("Window.screenLeft")}} and {{domxref("Window.screenTop")}} have been implemented, as aliases of {{domxref("Window.screenX")}} and {{domxref("Window.screenY")}} ({{bug(1498860)}}).
- The {{domxref("XMLHttpRequest.getAllResponseHeaders()")}} method now returns header names all in lowercase, as per spec ({{bug(1398718)}}).
- The legacy `HTMLAllCollection` interface has been updated as per recent [spec updates](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/common-dom-interfaces.html#htmlallcollection) ({{bug(1398354)}}).
- {{domxref("Navigator.buildID")}} now returns a fixed timestamp as a privacy measure ({{bug(583181)}}).
- The following {{domxref("Document.execCommand()")}} UI feature commands have been disabled by default ({{bug(1490641)}}:

  - `enableObjectResizing`
  - `enableInlineTableEditing`
  - `enableAbsolutePositionEditor`

#### Service workers

- The {{domxref("ServiceWorkerContainer.startMessages()")}} method has been implemented ({{bug(1263734)}}).

#### Media, Web Audio, and WebRTC

- The {{domxref("PannerNode.refDistance")}}, {{domxref("PannerNode.maxDistance")}}, {{domxref("PannerNode.rolloffFactor")}}, and {{domxref("PannerNode.coneOuterGain")}} properties now correctly throw exceptions when set to values outside their accepted ranges ({{bug(1487963)}}).
- {{domxref("RTCRtpEncodingParameters")}} settings changed via {{domxref("RTCRtpSender.setParameters()")}} used to not update if the changes were made during a call. They will now update live, without renegotiation ({{bug(1253499)}}).
- {{domxref("RTCIceCandidateStats.relayProtocol")}} has been implemented — this is the standardized version of {{domxref("RTCIceCandidateStats.mozLocalTransport")}}, which has now been deprecated ({{bug(1435789)}}).
- Automatic Gain Control (AGC) is now enabled by default; this can be changed using the preference `media.getusermedia.agc_enabled` ({{bug(1496714)}}).

#### Removals

- The {{domxref("Window.event")}} property, added in Firefox 63 to aid with web compat issues, has been put behind a pref (`dom.window.event.enabled`) and disabled by default in release versions for now due to other issues that have been uncovered ({{bug(1493869)}}). Note that this was actually done late in the Firefox 63 release cycle, but we are mentioning it here just in case.
- The `LocalMediaStream` interface and its `stop()` method have been removed ({{bug(1258143)}}). This method is no longer available with the deprecation of `LocalMediaStream`. See {{SectionOnPage("/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaStreamTrack/stop", "Stopping a video stream")}} to learn how to stop an entire stream.
- The `AudioStreamTrack` and `VideoStreamTrack` interfaces have been removed, as both have been deprecated for some time ({{bug(1377146)}}). Their functionality has been merged into {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack")}}; tracks are now identified by the value of their {{domxref("MediaStreamTrack.kind", "kind")}} property, such as `audio` or `video`.

### Security

- The Symantec CA Distrust plan has been implemented (see {{bug(1409257)}}; see also the [Mozilla’s Plan for Symantec Roots](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.security.policy/FLHRT79e3XE/discussion) discussion for more details).
- {{httpheader("Referrer-Policy")}} can now be used to govern resources fetched via stylesheets ({{bug(1330487)}}) — see {{SectionOnPage("/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referrer-Policy", "Integration with CSS")}} for more information.

### Plugins

_No changes._

### WebDriver conformance (Marionette)

#### API changes

- Deprecated command end-points without the `Marionette:`, `L10n:`, or `Addon:` prefix (including `singeTap`) have been removed ({{bug(1504478)}}, {{bug(1504940)}}).

#### Bug fixes

- Synthesized `Shift` key events by using `WebDriver:PerformActions` didn't result in capitalized letters ({{bug(1405370)}}).
- `WebDriver:Navigate` could cause an infinite hang if the tab's underlying content process is changed multiple times during that navigation ({{bug(1504807)}}).
- To improve the performance, and to reduce the memory footprint of Firefox the default page to be loaded for a new tab or window is no longer `about:newtab` but `about:blank` ({{bug(1506643)}}).
- The content blocking introduction panel, which was shown on various web pages and caused element interactions to fail is disabled by default now ({{bug(1488826)}}).

## Changes for add-on developers

### API changes

#### Menus

- A new API, `{{WebExtAPIRef("menus.overrideContext()")}}`, can be called from the `contextmenu` DOM event to set a custom context menu in extension pages. This API allows extensions to hide all default Firefox menu items in favor of providing a custom context menu UI. This context menu can consist of multiple top-level menu items from the extension, and may optionally include tab or bookmark context menu items from other extensions. See [this blog post](https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2018/11/08/extensions-in-firefox-64/#cm) for more details.

  - `{{WebExtAPIRef("menus.overrideContext()")}}` was implemented in ({{bug(1280347)}}).
  - The `showDefaults: false` option, which can be used to hide the default context menu options, was implemented in ({{bug(1367160)}}).
  - `documentURLPatterns` can now be used to match a `moz-extension://` document URL, even if `{{WebExtAPIRef("menus.overrideContext()")}}` is used. This way, it can reliably be used to restrict custom menu items to certain documents ({{bug(1498896)}}).

- You can now restrict where context menus can appear in an add-on using the new `viewTypes` property in {{WebExtAPIRef("menus.create()")}} and {{WebExtAPIRef("menus.update()")}} ({{bug(1416839)}}).
- {{WebExtAPIRef("menus.update()")}} can now be used to update the icon of an existing menu item ({{bug(1414566)}}).
- Extensions can now detect which mouse button was used when a menu item was clicked — this can be found using the new `button` property of {{WebExtAPIRef("menus.OnClickData")}} ({{bug(1469148)}}).

#### Windows

- The {{WebExtAPIRef("windows.create()")}} method now has a new option available — `cookieStoreId` — which specifies the `CookieStoreId` to use for all tabs that were created when the window is opened ({{bug(1393570)}}).

#### Privacy

- The {{WebExtAPIRef("privacy.websites")}} `cookieConfig` property is an object that can accept a `behavior` property — this property can now take a new value, `reject_trackers`, which instructs the extension to reject tracking cookies ({{bug(1493057)}}).

#### devtools.panels API

- The [`devtools.panels.elements`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/devtools/panels/elements) `Sidebar.setPage()` method is now supported ({{bug(1398734)}}).

### Manifest changes

- The new `pinned` property of the [`page_action`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/page_action) manifest key enables extensions to control whether their page actions should be pinned to the location bar on install or not ({{bug(1494135)}}).
- In native manifests on Windows, the 32-bit registry view ([Wow6432Node)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WoW64#Registry_and_file_system) will be checked first for registry keys, followed by the "native" registry view; you should use whichever is appropriate for your application ({{bug(1494709)}}).
- The [`chrome_settings_overrides`](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/chrome_settings_overrides) field's `search_provider` object can now include new properties — `suggest_url` and `suggest_url_post_params` ({{bug(1486819)}}), and `search_url_post_params`.
