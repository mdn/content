## Changes for web developers

### HTML

No changes

### CSS

- A fix to how the {{cssxref("@counter-style/pad")}} descriptor handles the negative sign ({{bug(1714445)}}).
- The `-moz-tab-size` property has been unprefixed to the standard {{cssxref("tab-size")}}, and the prefixed version maintained as an alias ({{bug(737785)}}).

#### Removals

- The non-standard {{cssxref("-moz-outline-radius")}} property has been removed ({{bug(1715984)}}). The property has not been usable by web developers since Firefox 88, this completes the removal.

### JavaScript

- {{jsxref("Intl/DateTimeFormat/formatRange", "Intl.DateTimeFormat.prototype.formatRange()")}} and {{jsxref("Intl/DateTimeFormat/formatRangeToParts", "Intl.DateTimeFormat.prototype.formatRangeToParts()")}} are now supported in release builds. The `formatRange()` method returns a localized and formatted string for the range between two {{jsxref("Date")}} objects (e.g. "1/05/21 â€“ 1/10/21"). The `formatRangeToParts()` method returns an array containing the locale-specific _parts_ of a formatted date range ({{bug(1653024)}}).
- The {{jsxref("Intl/DateTimeFormat/DateTimeFormat", "Intl.DateTimeFormat() constructor")}} allows four new `timeZoneName` options for formatting how the timezone is displayed. These include the localized GMT formats `shortOffset` and `longOffset`, and the generic non-location formats `shortGeneric` and `longGeneric` ({{bug(1653024)}}).
- The {{jsxref("Global_Objects/Error/Error", "Error() constructor")}} can now take the error `cause` as value in the `option` parameter.
  This allows code to catch errors and throw new/modifed versions that retain the original error and stack trace ({{bug(1679653)}}).

### HTTP

- The [Gamepad API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API) now requires a [secure context](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts) ({{bug(1704005)}}).

### APIs

#### DOM

- The [Visual Viewport API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Visual_Viewport_API) is now enabled by default on Firefox desktop releases (it has been enabled on Firefox for Android since version 68).
  The API provides access to information describing the position of the {{Glossary("visual viewport")}} relative to the document, as well as to the window's content area.
  It also provides events that allow changes to the viewport to be monitored. ({{bug(1551302)}}).
- The [Gamepad API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad_API) is now protected by {{httpheader('Feature-Policy/gamepad','Feature-Policy: gamepad')}}.
  If disallowed by the [feature policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Feature_Policy), calls to {{domxref('Navigator.getGamepads()')}} will throw a `SecurityError` {{domxref('DOMException')}},
  and the {{event("gamepadconnected")}} and {{event("gamepaddisconnected")}} events will not fire.
  The default `allowlist` is `*`; this default will be updated to `self` in a future release, in order to match the specification. ({{bug(1704005)}}).
- `Window.clientInformation` has been added as an alias for {{domxref("Window.navigator")}}, in order to match recent specification updates and improve compatibility with other major browsers ({{bug(1717072)}}).

### WebDriver conformance (Marionette)

- Fixed a bug, which caused the commands `WebDriver:AcceptAlert` and `WebDriver:DismissAlert` to hang for user prompts as opened in a popup window ({{bug(1721982)}}).
- Fixed an inappropriate handling of the `webSocketUrl` capability, which would return `true` if `webSocketUrl` was not supported ({{bug(1713775)}}).
