<p><span class="seoSummary">Hi! If you're here, you're probably thinking about contributing a new article to MDN, but you're not sure where to put it or how to proceed. Look no further!</span></p>
</div>

<p>Just click the big "Contribute a page to MDN" button below and start writing. Don't worry! in the top right corner of the editor, you'll find a couple of links to help you out with <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Editor">our editing tools</a>. If you need further assistance, check out the {{anch("Join the MDN community")}} box at the bottom of this page.</p>

<p><a href="/en-US/docs/new?parent=118919">Contribute a page to MDN</a></p>

<p>Once you've made your contribution, a happy, helpful documentation gnome will come along, review (and if necessary tidy up) your article to ensure that it meets our <a href="/en-US/Apps/Design/Content">style guide</a>, and move it to the right place in our documentation structure. Then you'll have the thanks of a grateful developer community!</p>
