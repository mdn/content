**WebDAV** (_Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning_) is an {{Glossary("HTTP")}} Extension that lets web developers update their content remotely from a client.

WebDAV is rarely used alone, but two extensions are very common: {{Glossary("CalDAV")}} (remote-access calendar) and {{Glossary("CardDAV")}} (remote-access address book).

WebDAV allows clients to

- add, delete, and retrieve webpage metadata (e.g. author or creation date)
- link pages of any media type to related pages
- create sets of documents and retrieve hierarchical list
- copy and move webpages
- lock a document from being edited by more than one person at a time
