P2P (Peer-to-peer) is a computer networking architecture in which all participating nodes (_peers_) have equal privileges and share the workload. P2P differs from a client-server network architecture, where multiple _client_ nodes connect to centralized _servers_ for services. P2P is commonly found in Blockchain Applications.
