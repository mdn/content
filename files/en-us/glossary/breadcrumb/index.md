A **breadcrumb**, or breadcrumb trail, is a navigational aid that is typically placed between a site's header and the main content, displaying either a hierarchy of the current page in relation to the site's structure, from top level to current page, or a list of the links the user followed to get to the current page, in the order visited.

A location breadcrumb for this document might look something like this:

[MDN](/) > [Glossary](/en-US/docs/Glossary) > Breadcrumb

Breadcrumb trails enable users to be aware of their location within a website. This type of navigation, if done correctly, helps users know where they are in a site and how they got there. They can also help a user get back to where they were before and can reduce the number of clicks needed to get to a higher-level page.

> **Note:** There's no dedicated [semantic HTML element](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) for breadcrumb navigation menus, it's recommended to use an [`<ol>`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/ol) to represent it's hierarchical structure.
