**Kebab case** is a way of writing phrases without spaces, where spaces are replaced with hyphens `-`, and the words are typically all lower case. The name comes from the similarity of the words to meat on a kebab skewer. It's often stylized as "kebab-case" to remind the reader of its appearance.

Kebab casing is often used as a variable naming convention. However, in many languages, hyphens represent subtraction, so kebab casing is not an option. CSS properties such as {{cssxref("background-color")}} and {{cssxref("font-family")}} are in kebab case, and so are HTML attributes such as [`aria-label`](/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) and [`data-*`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*).

Kebab-cased words are often simply referred to as _hyphenated_.
