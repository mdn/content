<p class="seoSummary"><strong>Time to Interactive</strong> (TTI) is a non-standardized web performance 'progress' metric defined as the point in time when the last <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Long_Tasks_API">Long Task</a> finished and was followed by 5 seconds of network and main thread inactivity.</p>

<p>TTI, proposed by the Web Incubator Community Group in 2018, is intended to provide a metric that describes when a page or application contains useful content and the main thread is idle and free to respond to user interactions, including having event handlers registered.</p>

<h4 id="Caveat">Caveat:</h4>

<p>TTI is derived by leveraging information from the {{domxref("Long Tasks API")}}. Although available in some performance monitoring tools, TTI is not a part of any official web specification at the time of writing.</p>
