<p>Placeholder names are commonly used in cryptography to indicate the participants in a conversation, without resorting to terminology such as "Party A," "eavesdropper," and "malicious attacker."</p>

<p>The most commonly used names are:</p>

<ul>
 <li><em>Alice</em> and <em>Bob</em>, two parties who want to send messages to each other, occasionally joined by <em>Carol</em>, a third participant</li>
 <li><em>Eve</em>, a passive attacker who is eavesdropping on Alice and Bob's conversation</li>
 <li><em>Mallory</em>, an active attacker ("man-in-the-middle") who is able to modify their conversation and replay old messages</li>
</ul>
