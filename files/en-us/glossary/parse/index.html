<p>Parsing means analyzing and converting a program into an internal format that a runtime environment can actually run, for example the {{glossary("JavaScript")}} engine inside browsers.</p>

<p>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML">browser parses HTML</a> into a {{glossary('DOM')}} tree. HTML parsing involves <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/DOMTokenList">tokenization</a> and tree construction. HTML tokens include start and end tags, as well as attribute names and values. If the document is well-formed, parsing it is straightforward and faster. The parser parses tokenized input into the document, building up the document tree.</p>

<p>When the HTML parser finds non-blocking resources, such as an image, the browser will request those resources and continue parsing. Parsing can continue when a CSS file is encountered, but <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags—particularly those without an <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function">async</a></code> or <code>defer</code> attribute—blocks rendering, and pauses parsing of HTML.</p>

<p>When the browser encounters CSS styles, it parses the text into the CSS Object Model (or {{glossary('CSSOM')}}), a data structure it then uses for styling layouts and painting. The browser then creates a render tree from both these structures to be able to paint the content to the screen. JavaScript is also downloaded, parsed, and then execute.</p>

<p>JavaScript parsing is done during {{glossary("compile time")}} or whenever the {{glossary("parser")}} is invoked, such as during a call to a method.</p>
