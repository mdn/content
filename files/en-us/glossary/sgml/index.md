The _Standard Generalized Markup Language_ (**SGML**) is an {{Glossary("ISO")}} specification for defining declarative markup languages.

On the web, {{Glossary("HTML")}} 4, {{Glossary("XHTML")}}, and {{Glossary("XML")}} are popular SGML-based languages. It is worth noting that since its fifth edition, HTML is no longer SGML-based and has its own parsing rules.
