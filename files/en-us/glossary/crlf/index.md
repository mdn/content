CR and LF are [control characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_character) or [bytecode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode) that can be used to mark a line break in a text file.

- CR = **Carriage Return** (`\r`, `0x0D` in hexadecimal, 13 in decimal) — moves the cursor to the beginning of the line without advancing to the next line.
- LF = **Line Feed** (`\n`, `0x0A` in hexadecimal, 10 in decimal) — moves the cursor down to the next line without returning to the beginning of the line.

A CR immediately followed by a LF (CRLF, `\r\n`, or `0x0D0A`) moves the cursor down to the next line and then to the beginning of the line.
