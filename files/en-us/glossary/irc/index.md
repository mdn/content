**IRC** (_Internet Relay Chat_) is a worldwide chat system requiring an Internet connection and an IRC client, which sends and receives messages via the IRC server.

Designed in the late 1980s by Jarrko Oikarinen, IRC uses {{glossary("TCP")}} and is an open protocol. The IRC server broadcasts messages to everyone connected to one of many IRC channels (each with their own ID).
