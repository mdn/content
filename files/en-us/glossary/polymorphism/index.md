Polymorphism is the presentation of one interface for multiple data types.

For example, integers, floats, and doubles are implicitly polymorphic: regardless of their different types, they can all be added, subtracted, multiplied, and so on.

In the case of {{glossary("OOP")}}, by making the {{glossary("class")}} responsible for its code as well as its own data, polymorphism can be achieved in that each class has its own {{glossary("function")}} that (once called) behaves properly for any {{glossary("object")}}.
