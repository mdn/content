<p>SQL injection takes advantage of Web apps that fail to validate user input. Hackers can maliciously pass SQL commands through the Web app for execution by a backend database.</p>

<p>SQL injection can gain unauthorized access to a database or to retrieve information directly from the database. Many data breaches are due to SQL injection.</p>

<h2 id="How_It_Works">How It Works</h2>

<p><img alt="" src="updates_loginscreen.png"></p>

<p>After entering username and password, behind the GUI the SQL queries work as follows:</p>

<pre class="brush: sql">"SELECT Count(*) FROM Users WHERE Username=' " + txt.User.Text+" ' AND Password=' "+ txt.Password.Text+" ' ";</pre>

<p>Now suppose User enters the Username: admin and Password: passwd123, so after clicking on the Log in button, SQL query will run as follows:</p>

<pre class="brush: sql">"SELECT Count(*) FROM Users WHERE Username=' admin ' AND Password=' passwd123 ' ";</pre>

<p>If the credentials are correct, then the user is allowed to log in, so it's a very simple (and therefore insecure) mechanism. Hackers use this insecurity to gain unauthorized access.</p>

<p>Hackers use a simple string called a Magical String, for example:</p>

<p><strong>Username: <em>admin</em></strong></p>

<p><strong>Password: <em>anything 'or'1'='1</em></strong></p>

<p>After clicking on the login button, the SQL query will work as follows:</p>

<pre class="brush: sql">"SELECT Count(*) FROM Users WHERE Username=' admin ' AND Password=' anything 'or'1'='1 ' ";</pre>

<p>Just take a closer look at the above query's password section.</p>

<pre>Password=' anything 'or'1'='1 '</pre>


<p>The password is not 'anything', hence password=anything results in FALSE, but '1'='1' is a TRUE statement and hence returns a TRUE value. Finally, due to the OR operator, the value ( FALSE OR TRUE ) is TRUE, so authentication bypasses successfully. Just due to a simple string (Magical String) the entire database is compromised.</p>


<h2 id="How_To_Prevent">How To Prevent</h2>

<p>Before executing the queries for the user credentials, make some changes like the following:</p>

<pre class="brush: sql">$id = $_GET['id']

(1) $id = Stripslashes($id)

(2) $id = mysql_real_escape_String($id)</pre>

<p>So due to (1) each single quote (') in the input string is replaced with double quotes ("), and due to (2) before every (') it adds (/). The revised magical string fails to bypass the authentication, and your database stays secure.</p>
