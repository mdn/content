<p><span class="seoSummary">A Slug is the unique identifying part of a web address, typically at the end of the URL. In the context of MDN, it is the portion of the URL following "<em>&lt;locale&gt;/docs/</em>".</span></p>

<p>It may also just be the final component when a new document is created under a parent document; for example, this page's slug is <code>Glossary/Slug</code> .</p>
