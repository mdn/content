A Slug is the unique identifying part of a web address, typically at the end of the URL. In the context of MDN, it is the portion of the URL following "_\<locale>/docs/_".

It may also just be the final component when a new document is created under a parent document; for example, this page's slug is `Glossary/Slug` .
