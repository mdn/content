An **IP address** is a number used to address each device on an IP network uniquely.

_IP_ stands for _Internet Protocol_ which is the [protocol layer](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19683-01/806-4075/ipov-7/index.html) with which the address is associated.

"IP address" typically still refers to 32-bit IPv4 addresses until IPv6 is deployed more broadly.
