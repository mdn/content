An IP address accronym for Internet Protocol address, is a unique number assigned to every device connected to a network that uses the Internet protocol. IP addresses enable devices online to find each other. Without IP addresses we wouldn't be able to view any online content.

"IP address" typically still refers to 32-bit IPv4 addresses until IPv6 is deployed more broadly.
