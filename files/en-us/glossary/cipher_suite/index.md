A cipher suite is a combination of a key exchange algorithm, authentication method, bulk encryption {{Glossary("cipher")}}, and message authentication code.

In a {{Glossary("cryptosystem")}} like {{Glossary("TLS")}}, the client and server must agree on a cipher suite before they can begin communicating securely.Â  A typical cipher suite looks like ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 or ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256, indicating:

- ECDHE (elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman ephemeral) for key exchange
- RSA for authentication
- AES-128 as the cipher, with Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) as the block cipher mode of operation
- SHA-256 as the hash-based message authentication code (HMAC)
