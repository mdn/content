An immutable {{glossary("object")}} is one whose content cannot be changed.
An object can be immutable for various reasons, for example:

- To improve performance (no planning for the object's future changes)
- To reduce memory use (make {{glossary("object reference","object references")}} instead of cloning the whole object)
- Thread-safety (multiple threads can reference the same object without interfering with one other)
