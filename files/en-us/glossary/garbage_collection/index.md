**[Garbage collection](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_Management#garbage_collection)** is a term used in {{Glossary("computer programming")}} to describe the process of finding and deleting {{Glossary("object", "objects")}} which are no longer being {{Glossary("object reference", "referenced")}} by other objects.

In other words, garbage collection is the process of removing any objects which are not being used by any other objects. Often abbreviated "GC," garbage collection is a fundamental component of the [memory management](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Memory_Management) system used by {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}.
