Progressive web applications (PWA) are applications that are built using web platform technologies, but that provide a user experience like that of a platform-specific app.

These kinds of apps enjoy enjoy all the best parts of the Web â€” such as discoverability via search engines, being linkable via {{Glossary("URL")}}s, and working across multiple form factors, but are progressively enhanced with modern APIs (such as [Service Workers](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) and [Push](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API)).

These features include being installable, working offline, and being easy to sync with and re-engage the user from the server.
