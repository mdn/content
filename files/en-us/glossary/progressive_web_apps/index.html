<p>Progressive web apps is a term used to describe the modern state of web app development. This involves taking standard web sites/apps that enjoy all the best parts of the Web — such as discoverability via search engines, being linkable via {{Glossary("URL")}}s, and working across multiple form factors — and supercharging them with modern APIs (such as <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API">Service Workers</a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Push_API">Push</a>) and features that confer other benefits more commonly attributed to native apps.</p>

<p>These features include being installable, working offline, and being easy to sync with and re-engage the user from the server.</p>
