<p>The <strong>Real-time Transport Protocol</strong> (<strong>RTP</strong>) is a network protocol which described how to transmit various media (audio, video) from one endpoint to another in a real-time fashion. RTP is suitable for video-streaming application, telephony over {{glossary("IP")}} like Skype and conference technologies.</p>

<p>The secure version of RTP, <strong>SRTP</strong>, is used by <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API">WebRTC</a>, and uses encryption and authentication to minimize the risk of denial-of-service attacks and security breaches.</p>

<p>RTP is rarely used alone; instead, it is used in conjunction with other protocols like {{glossary("RTSP")}} and {{glossary("SDP")}}.</p>
