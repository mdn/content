A **grid row** is a horizontal track in a [CSS grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout), that is the space between two horizontal grid lines. It is defined by the {{cssxref("grid-template-rows")}} property or in the shorthand {{cssxref("grid")}} or {{cssxref("grid-template")}} properties.

In addition, rows may be created in the _implicit grid_ when items are placed outside of rows created in the _explicit grid_. These rows will be auto sized by default, or can have a size specified with the {{cssxref("grid-auto-rows")}} property.

When working with alignment in [CSS grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout), the axis along which rows run is known as the _inline, or row, axis_.
