<p>A <strong>representation header</strong> is an {{glossary("HTTP_header", "HTTP header")}} that describes the particular <em>representation</em> of the resource sent in an HTTP message body.</p>

<p>Representations are different forms of a particular resource.
  For example, the same data might be formatted as a particular media type such as XML or JSON, localised to a particular written language or geographical region, and/or compressed or otherwise encoded for transmission.
  The underlying resource is the same in each case, but its representation is different.</p>

<p>Clients specify the formats that they prefer to be sent during <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Content_negotiation">content negotiation</a> (using <code>Accept-*</code> headers), and the representation headers tell the client the format of the <em>selected representation</em> they actually received.</p>

<p>Representation headers may be present in both HTTP request and response messages.
  If sent as a response to a <code>HEAD</code> request, they describe the body content that <em>would</em> be selected if the resource was actually requested.</p>

<p>Representation headers include: {{HTTPHeader("Content-Type")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Content-Encoding")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Content-Language")}}, and {{HTTPHeader("Content-Location")}}.</p>
