Screen readers are software applications that attempt to convey what is seen on a screen display in a non-visual way, usually as text to speech, but also into braille or sound icons. Screen readers are essential to people who are visually impaired, illiterate, or have a learning disability. There are some browser extension screen readers, but most screen readers operate system-wide for all user applications, not just the browser.

In terms of web {{glossary("accessibility")}}, most user agents provide an accessibility object model and screen readers interact with dedicated accessibility APIs, using various operating system features and employing hooking techniques.
