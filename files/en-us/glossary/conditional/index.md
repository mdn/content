<p>A <strong>condition</strong> is a set of rules that can interrupt normal code execution or change it, depending on whether the condition is completed or not.</p>

<p>An instruction or a set of instructions is executed if a specific condition is fulfilled. Otherwise, another instruction is executed. It is also possible to repeat the execution of an instruction, or set of instructions, while a condition is not yet fulfilled.</p>
