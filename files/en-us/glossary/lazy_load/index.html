<p><strong>Lazy loading</strong> is a strategy that delays the loading of some assets (e.g., images) until they are needed by the user based on the user's activity and navigation pattern; typically, these assets are only loaded when they are scrolled into view. </p>

<p>If correctly implemented, this delay in asset loading is seamless to the user experience and might help improve initial load performance, including <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Time_to_interactive">time to interactive</a>, as fewer assets are required for the page to start working.</p>
