<p>A <strong>signature</strong>, or <em>digital signature</em>, is a {{glossary("protocol")}} showing that a message is authentic.</p>

<p>From the {{glossary("hash")}} of a given message, the <strong>signing process</strong> first generates a digital signature linked to the signing entity, using the entity's private {{glossary("key")}}.</p>

<p>On receiving the message, the <strong>verification processÂ </strong></p>

<ul>
 <li><em>authenticates the sender -</em> uses the sender's public key to {{glossary("decryption","decrypt")}} the signature and recover the hash, which can only be created with the sender's private key, and</li>
 <li><em>checks message integrity -</em> compares the hash with a newly calculated one from the received document (the two hashes will differ if the document has been tampered with)</li>
</ul>

<p>The system fails if the private key is compromised or the recipient is deceitfully given the wrong public key.</p>
