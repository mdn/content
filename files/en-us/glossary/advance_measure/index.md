The **advance measure** of a glyph is its _advance width_ or _advance height_, whichever is in the inline axis of the element.

This term is used in the definition of a number of CSS {{cssxref("&lt;length&gt;")}} units.
For example, `ch` is the _advance measure_ of the "0" character in the given typeface.
For a horizontal inline axis, this will be the width of the character.
