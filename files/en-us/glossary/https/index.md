**HTTPS** (**_HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure_**) is an encrypted version of the {{Glossary("HTTP")}} protocol. It uses {{Glossary("SSL")}} or {{Glossary("TLS")}} to encrypt all communication between a client and a server. This secure connection allows clients to safely exchange sensitive data with a server, such as when performing banking activities or online shopping.
