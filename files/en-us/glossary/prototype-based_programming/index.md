**Prototype-based programming** is a style of {{Glossary("OOP", "object-oriented programming")}} in which {{Glossary('Class', 'classes')}} are not explicitly defined, but rather derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class or, less frequently, adding them to an empty object.

In simple words: this type of style allows the creation of an {{Glossary('Object', 'object')}} without first defining its {{Glossary('Class', 'class')}}.
