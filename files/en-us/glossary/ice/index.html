<p><strong>ICE</strong> (<em>Interactive Connectivity Establishment</em>) is a framework used by {{glossary("WebRTC")}} (among other technologies) for connecting two peers, regardless of network topology (usually for audio and video chat). This protocol lets two peers find and establish a connection with one another even though they may both be using Network Address Translator ({{glossary("NAT")}}) to share a global IP address with other devices on their respective local networks.</p>

<p>The framework algorithm looks for the lowest-latency path for connecting the two peers, trying these options in order:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Direct UDP connection (In this case—and only this case—a {{glossary("STUN")}} server is used to find the network-facing address of a peer)</li>
 <li>Direct TCP connection, via the HTTP port</li>
 <li>Direct TCP connection, via the HTTPS port</li>
 <li>Indirect connection via a relay/{{glossary("TURN")}} server (if a direct connection fails, e.g., if one peer is behind a firewall that blocks NAT traversal)</li>
</ol>
