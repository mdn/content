Entity is a term from the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), which refers to a reference to information that can be defined once and used throughout a document.

The term "HTML Entity" is used as a synonym for a {{glossary("character reference")}} â€” a pattern of characters that can represent another character in the HTML.
For example, `&lt;` is used to represent the less-than symbol (`<`) in HTML content.
