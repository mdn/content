**Internationalization**, often shortened to "i18n", is the practice of designing a system in such a way that it can easily be adapted for different target audiences, that may vary in region, language, or culture.

The complementary process of adapting a system for a specific target audience is called {{glossary("Localization")}}.

Among other things, internationalization covers adapting to differences in:

- writing systems
- units of measure (currency, °C/°F, km/miles, etc.)
- time and date formats
- keyboard layouts

The work of the [Unicode Consortium](https://home.unicode.org/) is a fundamental part of internationalization. Unicode supports not only variations among the world's writing systems but also cultural variations such as currencies and time/date formats.
