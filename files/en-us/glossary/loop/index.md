A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is met in {{Glossary("computer programming")}}. An example would be the process of getting an item of data and changing it, and then making sure some {{Glossary("conditional", "condition")}} is checked such as, if a counter has reached a prescribed number.

## Examples

### For loop

#### Syntax:

    for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3){
     execute code block
    }

- Statement 1 is executed once before the code block is run.
- Statement 2 defines the condition needed to execute the code block.
- Statement 3 is executed every time the code block is run.

#### Example:

```js
for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++){
    console.log(i)
}
//This loop will print numbers 0-9, will stop when condition is met (i = 10)
```

For the above example, the syntax is as follows:

- Statement 1 sets the variable for the loop (var i = 0).
- Statement 2 sets the loop condition (i < 10).
- Statement 3 increases the value of i (i++) each time the code block is run.

### While loop

#### Syntax:

    while (condition){
     execute code block
    }

- The code block will continue to loop as long as the condition is true.

#### Example:

```js
var i = 0;
while(i < 5){
    console.log(i)
    i++
}
//This loop  will print number 0-4, will stop when condition becomes false (i >=5)
```

For the above example, the syntax is as follows:

- The code block will continue to run as long as the variable (i) is less than 5.
