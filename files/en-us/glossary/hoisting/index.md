JavaScript **Hoisting** refers to the process whereby the interpreter appears to move the _declaration_ of functions, variables or classes to the top of their scope, prior to execution of the code.

_Hoisting_ is not a term normatively defined in the ECMAScript specification. The spec does define a group of declarations as [_HoistableDeclaration_](https://tc39.es/ecma262/multipage/ecmascript-language-statements-and-declarations.html#prod-HoistableDeclaration), but this only includes [`function`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function), [`function*`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function*), [`async function`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function), and [`async function*`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function*) declarations. Hoisting is often considered a feature of [`var`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var) declarations as well, although in a different way. In colloquial terms, any of the following behaviors may be regarded as hoisting:

1. Being able to use a variable's value in its scope before the line it is declared. ("Value hoisting")
2. Being able to reference a variable in its scope before the line it is declared, without throwing a {{jsxref("ReferenceError")}}, but the value is always [`undefined`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined). ("Declaration hoisting")
3. The declaration of the variable causes behavior changes in its scope before the line in which it is declared.

The four function declarations above are hoisted with type 1 behavior; `var` declaration is hoisted with type 2 behavior; [`let`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let), [`const`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/const), and [`class`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/class) declarations (also collectively called _lexical declarations_) are hoisted with type 3 behavior.

Some prefer to see `let`, `const`, and `class` as non-hoisting, because the [temporal dead zone](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/let#temporal_dead_zone_tdz) strictly forbids any use of the variable before its declaration. This dissent is fine, since hoisting is not a universally-agreed term. However, the temporal dead zone can cause other observable changes in its scope, which suggests there's some form of hoisting:

```js
const x = 1;
{
  console.log(x); // ReferenceError
  const x = 2;
}
```

If the `const x = 2` declaration is not hoisted at all (as in, it only comes into effect when it's executed), then the `console.log(x)` statement should be able to read the `x` value from the upper scope. However, because the `const` declaration still "taints" the entire scope it's defined in, the `console.log(x)` statement reads the `x` from the `const x = 2` declaration instead, which is not yet initialized, and throws a {{jsxref("ReferenceError")}}. Still, it may be more useful to characterize lexical declarations as non-hoisting, because from a utilitarian perspective, the hoisting of these declarations doesn't bring any meaningful features.

Note that the following is not a form of hoisting:

```js
{
  var x = 1;
}
console.log(x); // 1
```

There's no "access before declaration" here; it's simply because `var` declarations are not scoped to blocks.
