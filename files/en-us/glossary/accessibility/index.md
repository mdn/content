_Web Accessibility_ (**A11Y**) refers to best practices for keeping a website usable despite physical and technical restrictions. Web accessibility is formally defined and discussed at the {{Glossary("W3C")}} through the {{Glossary("WAI","Web Accessibility Initiative")}} (WAI). Web accessibility is about making the Web accessible to everyone. This includes people with all forms of disabilities, including:

- Cognitive
- Neurologic
- Physical
- Discursive
- Visual
- Auditory

Accessibility covers disability and also counts cases where people using the Web have the following limitations:

- Poor internet connectivity
- Temporary injury (eg, broken arm)
- People who use devices with smaller screens like smartwatches, smart TVs, etc.


To cover these needs it is using the **POUR** principle, which is the acronym for:

- Perceivable
- Operable
- Understandable
- Robust

This principle guides the construction of accessible websites. This principle helps to put people at the center of the process.

## Perceivable

Content on the web must be understandable. This means that the web must be available to the senses (sight, touch and hearing) through the browser or through assistive technologies such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, etc.

## Operable

Content on the web must be operable. This means that users can interact with all controls and interactive elements using the mouse, keyboard or an assistive device. If the content is impossible to browse, then it is inaccessible.

## Understandable

Web content must be clear, concise, and easy to understand. Try as much as possible to reduce spelling errors and use complex grammar. That's because, as web developers, we generally shouldn't assume user knowledge.

## Robust

It is very important to have consistency on the web. What this means is, do you maximize compatibility with the tools you are building? Does your website work the same on all platforms, eg browsers, operating systems and device sizes, etc.?
