In computer programming, **asynchronous** refers to the occurrence of events independent of the main program flow and ways to deal with such events. This is particularly useful for improving the efficiency and responsiveness of applications, especially those involving I/O operations like network requests, file access, or {{glossary("database")}} queries. The opposite one is {{glossary("synchronous")}}.

There are a number of programming techniques for implementing asynchronous software. See [Asynchronous JavaScript](/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous) for an introduction to them.
