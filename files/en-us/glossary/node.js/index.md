## Node Package Manager (npm)

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) is bundled with Node.js. It runs on the command line as the command `npm`. It is a package manager that downloads packages into a `node_modules` folder. You call the downloaded packages through `const libraryModule = require("libraryname")`.
