## Node Package Manager (npm)

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com) is a package manager that is downloaded and bundled alongside Node.js. Its command-line (CLI) client `npm` can be used to download, configure and create packages for use in Node.js projects. Downloaded packages can be imported by [ES imports](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) and [CommonJS `require()`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CommonJS) without including the dependency directory `node_modules/` they are downloaded to, as Node.js [resolves](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#loading-from-node_modules-folders) packages without a relative or absolute path specified in their import.

Packages hosted on npm are downloaded from the registry at [https://registry.npmjs.org/](https://registry.npmjs.org/), but the CLI be configured to use any compatible instance.
