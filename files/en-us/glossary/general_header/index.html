<p>A <strong>general header</strong> is an {{glossary('Header', 'HTTP header')}} that can be used in both request and response messages but doesn't apply to the content itself. Depending on the context they are used in, general headers are either {{glossary("Response header", "response")}} or {{glossary("request header", "request headers")}}. However, they are not {{glossary("entity header", "entity headers")}}.</p>

<p>The most common general headers are {{HTTPHeader('Date')}}, {{HTTPheader("Cache-Control")}} or {{HTTPHeader("Connection")}}.</p>
