A **frame rate** is the speed at which the browser is able to recalculate, layout and paint content to the display. The **frames per second**, or **fps**, is how many frames can be repainted in one second. The goal frame rate for in website computer graphics is 60fps.

Movies generally have a frame rate of 24 fps. They are able to have fewer frames per second because the illusion of life is created with motion blurs. When moving on a computer screen there are no motion blurs (unless you are animating an image [sprite](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Implementing_image_sprites_in_CSS) with motion blurs).
