<p>A <strong>frame rate</strong> is the speed at which the browser is able to recalculate, layout and paint content to the display. The <strong>frames per second</strong>, or <strong>fps</strong>, is how many frames can be repainted in one second. The goal frame rate for in web site computer graphics is 60fps.</p>

When moving on a computer screen there are no motion blurs (unless you are animating an image <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Implementing_image_sprites_in_CSS">sprite</a> with motion blurs).</p>
