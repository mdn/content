IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) is a {{Glossary("protocol")}} used to retrieve and store emails. More recent than {{Glossary("POP")}}, IMAP allows folders and rules on the server.

Unlike POP3, IMAP allows multiple simultaneous connections to one mailbox. Clients accessing a mailbox can receive information about state changes made from other clients. IMAP also provides a mode for clients to stay connected and receive information on demand.

Mark Crispin initially developed IMAP in 1986 as _Interim Mail Access Protocol_. IMAP4 revision 1 is the current version, defined by [RFC 3501](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3501).
