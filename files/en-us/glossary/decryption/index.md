In {{glossary("cryptography")}}, **decryption** is the conversion of {{glossary("ciphertext")}} into {{glossary("plaintext")}}.

Decryption is an operation which transforms a ciphertext message into plaintext using a cryptographic algorithm called a {{glossary("cipher")}}. Like encryption, decryption in modern ciphers is performed by using a specific algorithm and a secret, called the {{glossary("key")}}.

Decryption is the reverse process of {{glossary("encryption")}} and if the key stays secret, is mathematically hard to perform. The difficulty depends on the security of the cryptographic algorithm chosen and the research progress of {{glossary("cryptanalysis")}}.
