<p>A <strong>dynamic programming language</strong>Â is a programming language in which operations otherwise done at compile-time can be done at run-time. For example, in JavaScript it is possible to change the type of a variable or add new properties or methods to an object while the program is running.</p>

<p>This is opposed to so-called static programming languages, in which such changes are normally not possible.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Note that while there is indeed a connection between this dynamic/static property of programming languages and <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Dynamic_typing">dynamic</a>/<a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Static_typing">static-typing</a>, the two are far from synonymous.</p>
