In the context of data or an object **{{Glossary("Wrapper", "wrapper")}}** around that data, the value is the **{{Glossary("Primitive","primitive value")}}** that the object wrapper contains. In the context of a **{{Glossary("Variable","variable")}}** or **{{Glossary("Property","property")}}**, the value can be either a primitive or an **{{Glossary("Object reference","object reference")}}**.

In the context of CSS property values, there are specified, computed, and actual values. The final value for every CSS property applied to every element and pseudo-element is the result of a four-step calculation: the value is determined through specification (the "[specified value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/specified_value)", then resolved into a value that is used for inheritance (the "[computed value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/computed_value)"), then converted into an absolute value if necessary (the "[used value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/used_value)"), and finally transformed according to the limitations of the local environment (the "[actual value](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/actual_value)").

For CSS data types, see [CSS values and units](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Values_and_Units).
