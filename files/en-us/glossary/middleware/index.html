<p>Middleware is a (loosely defined) term for any software or service that enables the parts of a system to communicate and manage data. It is the software that handles <span style="line-height: 1.5;">communication between components and input/output, so developers can focus on the specific purpose of their application. </span></p>

<p>In server-side web application frameworks, the term is often more specifically used to refer to pre-built software components that can be added to the framework's request/response processing pipeline, to handle tasks such as database access.</p>
