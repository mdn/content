<p>In CSS, the <em>intrinsic size</em> of an element is the size it would be based on its content, if no external factors were applied to it. For example, inline elements are sized intrinsically: <code>width</code>, <code>height</code>, and vertical margin and padding have no impact, though horizontal margin and padding do.</p>

<p>How intrinsic sizes are calculated is defined in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-sizing-3/#intrinsic-sizes">CSS Intrinsic and Extrinsic Sizing Specification</a>.</p>

<p>Intrinsic sizing takes into account the <code>min-content</code> and <code>max-content</code> size of an element. For text the <code>min-content</code> size would be if the text wrapped as small as it can in the inline direction without causing an overflow, doing as much soft-wrapping as possible. For a box containing a string of text, the <code>min-content</code> size would be defined by the longest word. The keyword value of <code>min-content</code> for the {{cssxref("width")}} property will size an element according to the <code>min-content</code> size.</p>

<p>The <code>max-content</code> size is the opposite — in the case of text, this would have the text display as wide as possible, doing no soft-wrapping, even if an overflow was caused. The keyword value <code>max-content</code> exposes this behavior.</p>

<p>For images the intrinsic size has the same meaning — it is the size that an image would be displayed if no CSS was applied to change the rendering. By default images are assumed to have a "1x" pixel density (1 device pixel = 1 CSS pixel) and so the intrinsic size is simply the pixel height and width. The intrinsic image size and resolution can be explicitly specified in the {{Glossary("EXIF")}} data. The intrinsic pixel density may also be set for images using the {{htmlattrxref("srcset", "img")}} attribute (note that if both mechanisms are used, the <code>srcset</code> value is applied "over" the EXIF value).</p>
