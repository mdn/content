i18n (from "internationalization", a 20-letter word) is the best practice that enables products or services to be readily adapted to any target culture.

> **Internationalization** is the design and development of a product, application or document content that **_enables_** easy localization for target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language. (The {{Glossary("W3C")}} definition)

Among other things, i18n requires support for multiple

- character sets (usually via [Unicode](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Unicode))
- units of measure (currency, °C/°F, km/miles, etc.)
- time and date formats
- keyboard layouts
- text directions
