<p><strong>REST (</strong>Representational State Transfer) refers to a group of software architecture design constraints that bring about efficient, reliable and scalable distributed systems.</p>

<p>The basic idea of REST is that a resource, e.g. a document, is transferred via well-recognized, language-agnostic, and reliably standardized client/server interactions. Services are deemed RESTful when they adhere to these constraints.</p>

<p>HTTP APIs in general are sometimes colloquially referred to as RESTful APIs, RESTful services, or REST services, although they don't necessarily adhere to all REST constraints. Beginners can assume a REST API means an HTTP service that can be called using standard web libraries and tools.</p>
