<p>A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.</p>

<p>Here is a quick example:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">function greeting(name) {
  alert('Hello ' + name);
}

function processUserInput(callback) {
  var name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
  callback(name);
}

processUserInput(greeting);</pre>

<p>The above example is a {{glossary("synchronous")}} callback, as it is executed immediately.</p>

<p>Note, however, that callbacks are often used to continue code execution after an {{glossary("asynchronous")}} operation has completed â€” these are called asynchronous callbacks. A good example is the callback functions executed inside a <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then">.then()</a></code> block chained onto the end of a promise after that promise fulfills or rejects. This structure is used in many modern web APIs, such as <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch">fetch()</a></code>.</p>
