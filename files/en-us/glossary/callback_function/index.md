A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action.

Here is a quick example:

```js
function greeting(name) {
  alert('Hello ' + name);
}

function processUserInput(callback) {
  var name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
  callback(name);
}

processUserInput(greeting);
```

The above example is a {{glossary("synchronous")}} callback, as it is executed immediately.

Note, however, that callbacks are often used to continue code execution after an {{glossary("asynchronous")}} operation has completed â€” these are called asynchronous callbacks. A good example is the callback functions executed inside a [`.then()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then) block chained onto the end of a promise after that promise fulfills or rejects. This structure is used in many modern web APIs, such as [`fetch()`](/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch).
