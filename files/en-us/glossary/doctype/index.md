In {{Glossary("HTML")}}, the doctype is the required "`<!DOCTYPE html>`" preamble found at the top of all documents. Its sole purpose is to prevent a {{Glossary("browser")}} from switching into so-called [“quirks mode”](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode) when rendering a document; that is, the "`<!DOCTYPE html>`" doctype ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications, rather than using a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications.
