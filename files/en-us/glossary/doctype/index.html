<p>In {{Glossary("HTML")}}, the doctype is the required "<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>" preamble found at the top of all documents. Its sole purpose is to prevent a {{Glossary("browser")}} from switching into so-called <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode">“quirks mode”</a> when rendering a document; that is, the "<code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code>" doctype ensures that the browser makes a best-effort attempt at following the relevant specifications, rather than using a different rendering mode that is incompatible with some specifications.</p>
