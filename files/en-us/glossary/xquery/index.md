**XQuery** is a computer language for updating, retrieving, and calculating data in {{glossary("XML")}} databases.It is semantically similar to {{Glossary("SQL")}}. It was developed by the {{Glossary("W3C")}}'s XML Query working group in collaboration with XSL working group for the development of [XSLT](/en-US/docs/Web/XSLT) 2.0. The two groups share responsibilities for XPath, which is a subset of XQuery.
XQuery 1.0 became a W3C recommendation on January 23, 2007.
