A **baseline** is an imaginary line along the inline axis of a line box along which individual glyphs of text are aligned. Baselines guide the design of glyphs in a font and the alignment of glyphs from different fonts or font sizes when typesetting.

The **alphabetic baseline** is the value of the CSS `baseline` keyword. The bottom of most alphabetic glyphs typically align with the alphabetic baseline; most characters of European and West Asian fonts rest _on top_ of the alphabetic baseline.

Other writing systems have different baselines. For example, Tibetan and similar unicameral scripts with a strong but not absolute top edge are aligned to the bottom of a "hanging" baseline. East Asian scripts have no baseline; each glyph sits in a square box, with neither ascenders nor descenders. When mixed with scripts with a low baseline, East Asian characters should be set so that the bottom of the character is between the baseline and the descender height.
