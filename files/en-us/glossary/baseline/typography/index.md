The **baseline** is a term used in European and West Asian typography meaning an imaginary line upon which the most characters of a font rest.

East Asian scripts have no baseline; each glyph sits in a square box, with neither ascenders nor descenders. When mixed with scripts with a low baseline, East Asian characters should be set so that the bottom of the character is between the baseline and the descender height.
