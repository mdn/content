Baseline defines newer web features as being either widely available, newly available, or having limited availability in the following browsers:

- Apple Safari (iOS)
- Apple Safari (macOS)
- Google Chrome (Android)
- Google Chrome (desktop)
- Microsoft Edge (desktop)
- Mozilla Firefox (Android)
- Mozilla Firefox (desktop)

Baseline is a summary guide to browser support, but does address feature accessibility, usability, performance, security, or other concerns.
