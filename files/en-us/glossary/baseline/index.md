The **baseline** is a term used in European and West Asian typography meaning an imaginary line upon which the characters of a font rest.

The descenders of characters like g and p extend below this line. {{Glossary("glyph", "Glyphs")}} with rounded lower and upper extents like C or 3 slightly extend below it.

East Asian scripts have no baseline. Their glyphs are placed in a square box without ascenders or descenders.
