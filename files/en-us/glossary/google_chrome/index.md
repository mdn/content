**Chrome** is a free {{Glossary("Browser","web browser")}} developed by Google, based on the [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) open source project. Some key differences are described in BrowserStack's [Chrome vs Chromium: Core Differences](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/difference-between-chrome-and-chromium) guide.

Chrome, like Chromium, uses a rendering engine called {{Glossary("Blink")}}. On iOS though, due to platform restrictions, Chrome uses Apple's WebKit-based WebView instead of Blink.

## Download Chrome

Chrome is available on multiple platforms and comes in different versions for different user needs.
