Google Chrome is a free Web {{glossary("browser")}} developed by Google. It's based on the [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) open source project. Some key differences are described on [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/difference-between-chrome-and-chromium#toc5). Chrome supports its own layout called {{glossary("Blink")}}. Note that the iOS version of Chrome uses that platform's WebView, not Blink.
