Google Chrome is a free Web {{glossary("browser")}} developed by Google, based on the [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) open source project. Some key differences are described in BrowserStack's [Chrome vs Chromium: Core Differences](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/difference-between-chrome-and-chromium) guide.

Chromium also has its own layout engine called {{glossary("Blink")}}; note however that the iOS version of Chrome uses that platform's WebView rather than Blink, due to platform restrictions.
