A **static site generator** (SSG) is a software used to generate _static_ websites. A static website is comprised of {{glossary("HTML")}}, {{glossary("CSS")}}, and {{glossary("JavaScript")}} files, and most importantly does not have [server-side logic](/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side), so for any given URL, all users will receive the same content. The author writes pages in any form accepted by the generator, such as [React](/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Client-side_JavaScript_frameworks/React_getting_started), Markdown, or HTML templates, and the generator compiles them into a set of optimized static files that can be rendered by the browser.

Static sites are commonly used for blogs, documentation, and other content-driven websites, which don't have data that needs to be fetched or generated server-side. They are fast, secure, and easy to deploy, because they can be served from a {{glossary("CDN")}}.
