Blink is an open-source browser layout engine developed by Google as part of Chromium (and therefore part of {{glossary("Google Chrome", "Chrome")}} as well). Specifically, Blink began as a fork of the WebCore library in {{glossary("WebKit")}}, which handles layout, rendering, and {{glossary("DOM")}}, but now stands on its own as a separate {{glossary("rendering engine")}}.
