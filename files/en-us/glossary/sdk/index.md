An **SDK** (**Software Development Kit**) is an integrated collection of tools that a developer can use to create software for a specific framework, operating system, or other platform. An SDK can include:

- An editor
- A compiler
- A debugger
- An emulator or simulator, if the target platform is different from the platform used to create the program.
- Tools to help test and package the program for distribution.

SDKs are usually provided by the owner of a software platform, to support developers targeting the platform. For example, Google provides an [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio) for developers writing Android apps.

In many respects, the {{Glossary("developer tools")}} built into modern web browsers provide a similar function for web developers.
