**Trident** (or _MSHTML_) was the proprietary {{Glossary("Engine/Rendering", "rendering engine")}} that powered {{Glossary("Microsoft Internet Explorer", "Internet Explorer")}}. A {{Glossary("fork")}} called _EdgeHTML_ replaced Trident in Internet Explorer's successor, {{Glossary("Microsoft Edge", "Edge")}} (later referred to as "Microsoft Edge Legacy").

Trident is used in Microsoft Edge when 'IE mode' is on, a feature that allows Edge to render web pages using Trident for compatibility with legacy websites. Trident will only receive security updates until 2029 to support usage in IE mode.
