{{GlossarySidebar}}

In CSS, a **pseudo-element** selector applies styles to parts of your document content in scenarios where there isn't a specific HTML element to select. For example, rather than putting the first letter of each paragraph in its own element, you can style them all with {{Cssxref("::first-letter", "p::first-letter")}}.
