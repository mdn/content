<p>A fragmentainer is defined in the<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-break-3/"> CSS Fragmentation Specification</a> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A box—such as a page box, column box, or region—that contains a portion (or all) of a fragmented flow. Fragmentainers can be pre-defined, or generated as needed. When breakable content would overflow a fragmentainer in the block dimension, it breaks into the next container in its fragmentation context instead.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fragmented contexts are found in CSS Paged Media, where the fragmentainer would be the box which defines a page. In Multiple-column Layout the fragmentainer is the column box created when columns are defined on a multicol container. In CSS Regions each Region is a fragmentainer.</p>
