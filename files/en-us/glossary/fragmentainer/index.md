A **fragmentainer** is defined in the [CSS Fragmentation](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-break/) specification as follows:

> A box—such as a page box, column box, or region—that contains a portion (or all) of a fragmented flow. Fragmentainers can be pre-defined or generated as needed. When breakable content would overflow a fragmentainer in the block dimension, it breaks into the next container in its fragmentation context instead.

Fragmented contexts are found in [CSS paged media](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_paged_media), where the fragmentainer would be the box that defines a page. In [CSS multiple-column layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_multicol_layout), the fragmentainer is the column box created when columns are defined on a multicol container.
