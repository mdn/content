**SCTP** (Stream Control Transmission {{glossary("Protocol")}}) is an {{Glossary("IETF")}} standard for a transport protocol which enables the reliable, in-order transmission of messages while offering congestion control, multi-homing, and other features to improve reliability and stability of the connection. It's used for sending traditional telephone calls over the Internet, but is also used for {{Glossary("WebRTC")}} data.
