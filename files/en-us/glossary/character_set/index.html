<p><span class="seoSummary">A <strong>character set</strong> is an encoding system to let computers know how to recognize {{Glossary("Character")}}, including letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and whitespace.</span></p>

<p>In earlier times, countries developed their own character sets due to their different languages used, such as Kanji JIS codes (e.g. Shift-JIS, EUC-JP, etc.) for Japanese, Big5 for traditional Chinese, and KOI8-R for Russian. However, {{Glossary("Unicode")}} gradually became most acceptable character set for its universal language support.</p>

<p>If a character set is used incorrectly (For example, Unicode for an article encoded in Big5), you may see nothing but broken characters, which are called {{Interwiki("wikipedia", "Mojibake")}}.</p>
