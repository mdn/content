A constant is a value that the programmer cannot change, for example numbers (1, 2, 42). With {{glossary("variable","variables")}}, on the other hand, the programmer can assign a new {{glossary("value")}} to a variable name already in use.

Like variables, some constants are bound to identifiers. For example, the identifier `pi` could be bound to the value 3.14… .
