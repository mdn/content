A **scrollport** is the part of a {{glossary("Scroll container", "scroll container")}} in which the visible part of the container content is displayed. Scroll bars are used to move content in and out of the scrollport so that the content can be viewed. A scrollport coincides with the padding box of the scroll container element.

A scroll container allows overflow content to be viewed by scrolling. You can create a scroll container by specifying the {{cssxref("overflow")}} property of an element box as `scroll` or `auto`. A user agent adds scroll bars when the `overflow` property is set to `scroll` or when the `overflow` property is set to `auto` _and_ the content overflows the container.
