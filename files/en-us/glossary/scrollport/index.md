A **scrollport** is the visual viewport of a {{glossary("Scroll container", "scroll container")}} and represents the area in which the scrollable overflow content can be viewed. A scrollport coincides with the padding box of the scroll container element.

A scroll container allows overflow content to be viewed by scrolling. You can create a scroll container by specifying the {{cssxref("overflow")}} property of an element box as `scroll` or `auto`.
