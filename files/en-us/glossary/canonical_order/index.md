In CSS, canonical order is used to refer to the order in which separate values need to be specified (or {{Glossary("parse", "parsed")}}) or are to be {{Glossary("serialization", "serialized")}} as part of a CSS property value. It is defined by the formal {{Glossary("syntax")}} of the property and normally refers to the order in which longhand values should be specified as part of a single shorthand value.

For example, {{cssxref("background")}} shorthand property values are made up of several `background-*` longhand properties. The canonical order of those longhand values is defined as

1.  {{cssxref("background-image")}}
2.  {{cssxref("background-position")}}
3.  {{cssxref("background-size")}}
4.  {{cssxref("background-repeat")}}
5.  {{cssxref("background-attachment")}}
6.  {{cssxref("background-origin")}}
7.  {{cssxref("background-clip")}}
8.  {{cssxref("background-color")}}

Furthermore, its syntax defines, that if a value for the {{cssxref("background-size")}} is given, it **must** be specified **after** the value for the {{cssxref("background-position")}}, separated by a slash. Other values may appear in any order.
