A CSP ([Content Security Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)) is used to detect and mitigate certain types of website related attacks like {{Glossary("Cross-site_scripting")}} and data injections.

The implementation is based on an {{Glossary("HTTP")}} header called {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}}.
