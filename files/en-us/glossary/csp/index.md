A **CSP** ([Content Security Policy](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)) is used to detect and mitigate certain types of website related attacks like {{Glossary("Cross-site_scripting")}}, [clickjacking](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Attacks/Clickjacking) and data injections.

The implementation is based on an {{Glossary("HTTP")}} header called {{HTTPHeader("Content-Security-Policy")}}.
