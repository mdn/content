<p>A domain is an authority within the internet that controls its own resources. Its "domain name" is a way to address this authority as part of the hierarchy in a {{Glossary("URL")}} - usually the most memorable part of it, for instance a brand name.</p>

<p>A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) contains all necessary parts to look up this authority by name unambiguously using the {{Glossary("DNS")}} system of the internet.</p>

<p>For example, in "developer.mozilla.org":</p>

<ol>
 <li>"org" is called a {{interwiki("wikipedia", "Top-level_domain", "top-level domain")}}. They are registered as an internet standard by the {{interwiki("wikipedia", "Internet_Assigned_Numbers_Authority", "IANA")}} . Here, "org" means "organization" which is defined in a top-level <em>domain registry</em>.</li>
 <li>"mozilla" is the domain. If you like to own a domain you have to register it with one of the many {{interwiki("wikipedia", "Domain_name_registrar", "registrars")}} who are allowed to do so with a top-level domain registry.</li>
 <li>"developer" is a "sub-domain", something you as the owner of a domain may define yourself. Many owners choose to have a subdomain "www" to point to their {{Glossary("World_Wide_Web")}} resource, but that's not required (and has even fallen somewhat out of favor).</li>
</ol>
