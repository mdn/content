<p>A favicon (favorite icon) is a tiny icon included along with a website, which is displayed in places like the browser's address bar, page tabs and bookmarks menu.</p>

<p>Note, however, that most modern browsers replaced the favicon from the address bar by an image indicating whether or not the website is using {{Glossary("https","HTTPS")}}.</p>

<p>Usually, a favicon is 16 x 16 pixels in size and stored in the {{Glossary("GIF")}}, {{Glossary("PNG")}}, or ICO file format.</p>

<p>They are used to improve user experience and enforce brand consistency. When a familiar icon is seen in the browser's address bar, for example, it helps users know they are in the right place.</p>
