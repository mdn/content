A **_raster image_** is an image file defined as a grid of pixels. They're also referred to as _bitmaps_. Common raster image formats on the Web are [JPEG](/en-US/docs/Glossary/jpeg), [PNG](/en-US/docs/Glossary/PNG), [GIF](/en-US/docs/Glossary/gif), and [ICO](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO_(file_format)>).

Raster image files usually contain one set of dimensions, but the ICO and CUR formats, used for favicons and [CSS cursor images](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/cursor), can contain multiple sizes.
