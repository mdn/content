There are three definitions for **routers** on the web:

1. For the network layer, the router is a networking device that decides data {{Glossary('Packet')}}s directions. They are distributed by retailers allowing user interaction to the internet.
2. For a {{Glossary('SPA', 'Single-page application')}} in the application layer, a router is a library that decides what web page is presented by a given {{Glossary('URL')}}. This middleware module is used for all URL functions, as these are given a path to a file that is rendered to open the next page.
3. In the implementation of an {{Glossary('API')}} in a service layer, a router is a software component that parses a request and directs or routes the request to various handlers within a program. The router code usually accepts a response from the handler and facilitates its return to the requester.
