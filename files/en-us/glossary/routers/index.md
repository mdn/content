There are three definitions for **routers** on the web:

1. In computer networing, a router is a device that forwards {{Glossary("Packet", "data packets")}} between computer networks.
2. For a {{Glossary('SPA', 'Single-page application')}}, a router is a library that decides what web page is presented by a given {{Glossary('URL')}}.
   This middleware module is used for all URL functions, as these are given a path to a file that is rendered to open the next page.
3. In the implementation of an {{Glossary("API", "Application Programming Interface (API))}}, a router is a software component that parses a request and directs or routes the request to various handlers within a program.
   The router code usually accepts a response from the handler and facilitates its return to the requester.
