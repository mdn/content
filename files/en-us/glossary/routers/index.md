<p>There are three definitions for <strong>routers</strong> on the web:</p>

<ol>
 <li>For the network layer, the router is a networking device that decides data {{Glossary('Packet')}}s directions. They are distributed by retailers allowing user interaction to the internet.</li>
 <li>For a {{Glossary('SPA', 'Single-page application' )}} in the application layer, a router is a library that decides what web page is presented by a given {{Glossary('URL')}}. This middleware module is used for all URL functions, as these are given a path to a file that is rendered to open the next page.</li>
 <li>In the implementation of an {{Glossary('API')}} in a service layer, a router is a software component that parses a request and directs or routes the request to various handlers within a program.  The router code usually accepts a response from the handler and facilitates its return to the requester.</li>
</ol>
