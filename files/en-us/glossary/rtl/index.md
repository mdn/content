**RTL** (**Right To Left**) is a {{Glossary("locale")}} property indicating that text is written from right to left.

For example, the `he` locale (for Hebrew) specifiesÂ right-to-left. Arabic (`ar`) is another common language written RTL.

The opposite of RTL, LTR (Left To Right) is used in other languages, including English (`en`, `en-US`, `en-GB`, etc.), Spanish (`es`), and French (`fr`).
