A Second Level Domain (SLD) is the part of the domain name that is located right before a Top Level Domain ({{Glossary("TLD")}}).

For example, in `mozilla.org` the SLD is `mozilla` and the TLD is `org`.

A domain name is not limited to a TLD and SLD. Additional subdomains can be created to provide additional information about various server functions or to delimit areas under the same domain. For example, `www` is a commonly used subdomain to indicate that the domain points to a web server.

As another example, in `developer.mozilla.org`, the `developer` subdomain is used to specify that the subdomain contains the developer section of the Mozilla website.
