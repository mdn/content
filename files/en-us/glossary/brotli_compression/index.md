**Brotli** is a general-purpose lossless compression algorithm.
It compresses data using a combination of a modern variant of the [Lempel-Ziv coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78#LZ77) LZ77 algorithm, [Huffman coding](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Huffman_coding), and second-order context modeling, providing a compression ratio comparable to the best currently available general-purpose compression methods.

Brotli provides better compression ratios than {{glossary("GZip_compression", "gzip")}}, and speeds that are comparable to [deflate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deflate).
However brotli compression is slower than Gzip compression, so gzip may be a better option when compressing {{glossary("Cache", "non-cacheable")}} content.

Brotli is compatible with most modern browsers, but you may want to consider a fallback.
