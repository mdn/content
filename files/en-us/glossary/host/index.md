A host is a device connected to the {{glossary("Internet")}} (or a local network). Some hosts called {{glossary("server","servers")}} offer additional services like serving webpages or storing files and emails.

The host doesn't need to be a hardware instance. It can be generated by virtual machines. The host generated by virtual machines is called "Virtual hosting".
