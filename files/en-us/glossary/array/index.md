An _array_ is an ordered collection of data (either {{Glossary("primitive")}} or {{Glossary("object")}} depending upon the language). Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. This is compared to a variable that can store only one value.

Each item in an array has a number attached to it, called a numeric index, that allows you to access it. In JavaScript, arrays start at index zero and can be manipulated with various {{Glossary("Method", "methods")}}.

What an array in JavaScript looks like:

```js
let myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let catNamesArray = ["Jacqueline", "Sophia", "Autumn"];
//Arrays in JavaScript can hold different types of data, as shown above.
```
