<p>A <strong>hotlink</strong> (also known as an <strong>inline link</strong>) is an object (typically an image) directly linked to from another site. For example, an image hosted on site1.com is shown directly on site2.com.</p>

<p>The practice is often frowned upon as it can cause unwanted bandwidth usage on the website hosting the linked-to object, and copyright concerns â€” it is considered stealing when it is done without permission.</p>
