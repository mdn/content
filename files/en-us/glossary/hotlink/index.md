A **hotlink** (also known as an **inline link**) is an object (typically an image) directly linked to from another site. For example, an image hosted on site1.com is shown directly on site2.com.

The practice is often frowned upon as it can cause unwanted bandwidth usage on the website hosting the linked-to object, and copyright concerns — it is considered stealing when it is done without permission.
