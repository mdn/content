<p>In security protocols, a <em>challenge</em> is some data sent to the client by the server in order to generate a different response each time. Challenge-response protocols are one way to fight against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack">replay attacks</a> where an attacker listens to the previous messages and resends them at a later time to get the same credentials as the original message.</p>

<p>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication">HTTP authentication protocol</a> is challenge-response based, though the "Basic" protocol isn't using a real challenge (the realm is always the same).</p>
