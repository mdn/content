**POP3** (Post Office Protocol) is a very common {{glossary("protocol")}} for getting emails from a mail server over a {{glossary("TCP")}} connection. POP3 does not support folders, unlike the more recent {{Glossary("IMAP")}}, which is harder to implement because of its more complex structure.

Clients usually retrieve all messages and then delete them from the server, but POP3 does allow retaining a copy on the server. Nearly all email servers and clients currently support POP3.
