A smoke test consists of functional or unit tests of critical software functionality. Smoke testing comes before further, in-depth testing.

Smoke testing answers questions like

- "Does the program start up correctly?"
- "Do the main control buttons function?"
- "Can you save a simple blank new test user account?"

If this basic functionality fails, there is no point investing time in more detailed QA work at this stage.
