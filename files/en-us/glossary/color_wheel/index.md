A **color wheel**, or _color circle_, is a chart representing a palette of colors in a circle. A color wheel can display colors identified by two polar coordinates, the _angle_ and the _distance_ from the origin, the circle's center.

Color wheels are convenient for comparing colors expressed in polar or cylindrical coordinates, like [`hsl()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl), [`hwb()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/hwb), or [`lch()`](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value/lch).

In such cases, _complementary colors_ are often found opposite on the same diameter. Similarly, _monochromatic colors_ – colors of the same _tone_ but of different _shades_ – are located on the same radius, and _triadic colors_ – three colors evenly spaced around the color wheel that lead to colors that work well together – are also easy to find.

Color wheels are used in real life when we want to choose between different hues. For example, when selecting wall paint or the color for a piece furniture.

In the digital world, color wheels are used in _color pickers_, like the default one on macOS:
