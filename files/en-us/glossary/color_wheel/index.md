A **color wheel**, or _color circle_, is a chart representing a palette of colors on a disc. A color wheel can display colors identified by two polar coordinates, the _angle_ and the _distance_ from the origin, the circle's center.

Color wheels are convenient to compare colors expressed in polar or cylindrical coordinates, like [`hsl()`](/en-us/Web/CSS/color_value/hsl), [`hwb()`](/en-us/Web/CSS/color_value/hwb), or [`lch()`](/en-us/Web/CSS/color_value/lch).

In such cases, _complementary colors_ are often found opposite on the same diameter. Similarly, _monochromatic colors_ – colors of the same _tone_ but of different _shades_ – are located on the same radius, and _triadic colors_ – three colors evenly spaced around the color wheel that lead to vivid colors that work well together – are also easy to find.

Color wheels are used in real life when we want to choose between different taints. For example, when selecting some paint or the color of some furniture.

In the digital world, they are used in _color pickers_, like the default one on macOS:
