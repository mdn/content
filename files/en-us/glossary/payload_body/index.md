Prior to June 2022, the **payload body** or **payload** was the resource representation being transferred in an HTTP Message Body, stripped of any [transfer encoding](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Transfer-Encoding). With no transfer encoding, the _payload body_ and _message body_ are the same thing. Representation data could also be transferred in the HTTP Header, but such data would not be regarded as "payload".

With the release of RFC 9110, the word **content** replaces the word **payload**.  See [**HTTP content**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_Content).

For more information see [RFC 7230, section 3.3: Message Body](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.3), [RFC 7231, section 3: Representations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7231#section-3), and [RFC 9110, appendix B.3: Changes from RFC 7231](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110#name-changes-from-rfc-7231).
