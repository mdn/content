<p><span class="seoSummary">The term <strong>delta</strong> refers to the difference between two values or states.</span> The name originates from the Greek letter Δ (delta), which is equivalent to the letter <em>D</em> in the Roman alphabet. <em>Delta</em> refers to the use of the letter Δ as a shorthand for <em>difference</em>.</p>

<p>The term <em>delta</em> is commonly used when communicating changes in speed, position, or acceleration of a physical or virtual object. It's also used when describing changes in the volume or frequency of sound waves.</p>

<p>For example, when describing how far an object on the screen moves left-to-right, one might use the term <em>delta x</em> or <em>Δx</em>.</p>

<p>Likewise, given the new value of <em>X</em> and its old value, you might compute the delta like this:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">let deltaX = newX - oldX;</pre>

<p>More commonly, you receive the delta and use it to update a saved previous condition:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">let newX = oldX + deltaX;</pre>
