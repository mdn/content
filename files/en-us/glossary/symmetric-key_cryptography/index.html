<p>Symmetric-key cryptography is a term used for cryptographic algorithms that use the same key for encryption and for decryption. The key is usually called a "symmetric key" or a "secret key".</p>

<p>This is usually contrasted with <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Public-key_cryptography">Public-key cryptography</a> in which keys are generated in pairs and the transformation made by one key can only be reversed using the other key.</p>

<p>Symmetric-key algorithms should be secure when used properly and are highly efficient, so they can be used to encrypt large amounts of data without having a negative effect on performance.</p>

<p>Most symmetric-key algorithms currently in use are block ciphers: this means that they encrypt data one block at a time. The size of each block is fixed and determined by the algorithm: for example {{Glossary("AES")}} uses 16-byte blocks. Block ciphers are always used with a <em>{{Glossary("Block cipher mode of operation", "mode")}}</em>, which specifies how to securely encrypt messages that are longer than the block size. For example, AES is a cipher, while CTR, CBC, and GCM are all modes. Using an inappropriate mode, or using a mode incorrectly, can completely undermine the security provided by the underlying cipher.</p>
