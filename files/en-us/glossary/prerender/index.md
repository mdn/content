With prerendering, the content is [prefetched](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Prefetch) and then rendered in the background by the browser as if the content had been rendered into an invisible separate tab. When the user navigates to the prerendered content, the current content is replaced by the prerendered content instantly.

```html
<link rel="prerender" href="https://example.com/content/to/prerender">
```
