[**Safari**](https://www.apple.com/safari/) is a {{Glossary("Browser","Web browser")}} developed by Apple and is built into Apple's operating systems, including macOS, iPadOS, iOS and visionOS.

Safari was first introduced in 2003 on Mac OS X Panther, and later on iOS in 2007, using the open-source [WebKit](https://webkit.org/) engine, which derived from KHTML. Apple used to offer a version for Windows, but it was discontinued in 2012.
