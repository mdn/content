A **URI** _(Uniform Resource Identifier)_ is a string that refers to a resource.

The most common are {{Glossary("URL","URLs")}}, which identify the resource by giving its location on the Web. {{Glossary("URN","URNs")}}, by contrast, refer to a resource by a name, in a given namespace, such as the ISBN of a book.
