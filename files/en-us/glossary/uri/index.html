<p>A <strong>URI</strong><em> (Uniform Resource Identifier)</em> is a string that refers to a resource.</p>

<p>The most common are {{Glossary("URL","URL")}}s, which identify the resource by giving its location on the Web. {{Glossary("URN","URN")}}s, by contrast, refer to a resource by a name, in a given namespace, such asÂ the ISBN of a book.</p>
