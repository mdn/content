**Mozilla Firefox** is a free open-source {{Glossary("browser")}} whose development is overseen by the Mozilla Corporation. Firefox runs on Windows, OS X, Linux, and Android.

First released in November 2004, Firefox is completely customizable with themes, plug-ins, and [add-ons](/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons). Firefox uses {{glossary("Gecko")}} to render webpages, and implements both current and upcoming {{glossary("world wide web", "Web")}} standards.
