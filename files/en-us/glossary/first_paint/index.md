**First Paint**, part of the [Paint Timing API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Paint_Timing_API), is the time between navigation and when the browser renders the first pixels to the screen, rendering anything that is visually different from the default [background color](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color) of the [body](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/body). It answers the question "Is it happening?"
