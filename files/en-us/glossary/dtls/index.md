**Datagram Transport Layer Security** (**DTLS**) is a protocol used to secure datagram-based communications. It's based on the stream-focused Transport Layer Security ({{Glossary("TLS")}}), providing a similar level of security. As a datagram protocol, DTLS doesn't guarantee the order of message delivery, or even that messages will be delivered at all. However, DTLS gains the benefits of datagram protocols, too; in particular, the lower overhead and reduced latency.

These features are especially useful for one of the most common areasÂ in which DTLS comes into play: {{Glossary("WebRTC")}}. All of the WebRTC related protocols are required to encrypt their communications using DTLS; this includes {{Glossary("SCTP")}}, {{Glossary("RTP", "SRTP")}}, and {{Glossary("STUN")}}.
