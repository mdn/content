In computer science, a **Boolean** is a logical data type that can have only the values `true` or `false`.

For example, in JavaScript, Boolean conditionals are often used to decide which sections of code to execute (such as in [if statements](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/if...else)) or repeat (such as in [for loops](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)).

Below is some JavaScript pseudocode (it's not truly executable code) demonstrating this concept.

```js
/* JavaScript if statement */
if (boolean conditional) {
  // code to execute if the conditional is true
}

if (boolean conditional) {
  console.log("boolean conditional resolved to true");
} else {
  console.log("boolean conditional resolved to false");
}

/* JavaScript for loop */
for (control variable; boolean conditional; counter) {
  // code to execute repeatedly if the conditional is true
}
```

The Boolean value is named after English mathematician [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole), who pioneered the field of mathematical logic.
