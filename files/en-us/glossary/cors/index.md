**CORS** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a system, consisting of transmitting {{Glossary("HTTP_header", "HTTP headers")}}, that determines whether browsers block frontend JavaScript code from accessing responses for cross-origin requests.

The [same-origin security policy](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy) forbids cross-origin access to resources. But CORS gives web servers the ability to say they want to opt into allowing cross-origin access to their resources.

- {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Max-Age")}}
  - : Indicates how long the results of a preflight request can be cached.
- {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Request-Headers")}}
  - : Used when issuing a preflight request to let the server know which HTTP headers will be used when the actual request is made.
- {{HTTPHeader("Access-Control-Request-Method")}}
  - : Used when issuing a preflight request to let the server know which [HTTP method](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) will be used when the actual request is made.
