<p>Compiling is the process of transforming a computer program written in a given {{Glossary("computer programming", "language")}} into an equivalent program of another language. A compiler is a software to execute this task. Sometimes, this task is also referred to as "assembling" or "build", which typically indicates more than just compilation is done, e.g. packaging it in a binary format.</p>

<p>Usually, a compiler transforms a higher-level language such as C or {{Glossary("Java")}}, which humans understand, into a machine language, such as assembly, that the CPU can understand. Some compilers which translate between similar level languages are called transpilers or cross-compilers, for instance to compile from TypeScript to {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}. Those are considered productivity tools.</p>

<p>Most Compilers work either ahead-of-time (AOT) or just-in-time (JIT). As a programmer, you usually invoke AOT compilers from a command line or your {{Glossary("IDE")}}. The most famous, "gcc" is one example.<br>
 JIT compilers are usually transparent to you, used for performance. For instance in the browser: Firefox' <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/SpiderMonkey">SpiderMonkey</a> JavaScript Engine has a JIT built-in that will compile JavaScript in a website to machine code while you're viewing it so it runs faster. Projects like <a href="/en-US/docs/WebAssembly">WebAssembly</a> work on making this even better.</p>
