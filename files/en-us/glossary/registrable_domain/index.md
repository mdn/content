A **registrable domain** is a domain that can be (or has already been) registered by an individual or an organization through a domain name registrar. It's the highest level domain for a single {{glossary("site")}} on the web.

Registrable domains are created directly underneath an _effective top-level domain_ (eTLD), such as `.org`, `.com`, or `.ac.uk`. For this reason a registrable domain is sometimes called an "eTLD+1".

For example, all of the following are registrable domains:

```plain
crookedtimber.org
theguardian.com
sussex.ac.uk
```

All domains under a registrable domain belong to the same organization. For example:

```plain
 film.theguardian.com
music.theguardian.com
```

```plain
      news.sussex.ac.uk
      blog.sussex.ac.uk
admissions.sussex.ac.uk
```

Note that not all eTLDs are top-level domains, because many registrars allow organizations to register domains at levels below the top level. In the example above, `.ac.uk` is a subdomain of the top-level `.uk` domain, so `sussex.ac.uk` and `aber.ac.uk` can be registered to different organizations.

Because this is a matter of the registrar's policies, it's impossible to tell algorithmically whether a given domain name suffix (like `.ac.uk`) is publicly registrable or not. The [Public Suffix List](https://publicsuffix.org/) is a list of all suffixes under which organizations can directly register names: that is, it is a list of eTLDs.
