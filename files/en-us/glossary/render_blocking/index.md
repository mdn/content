**Render-blocking** refers to any part of the process of loading a website that blocks the rendering of the user interface. Render-blocking is bad for web performance because it increases the length of time until users can interact with the site â€” for example, viewing content or interacting with controls.

The most common causes of render-blocking are initially-loaded CSS or JavaScript files.
