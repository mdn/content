**DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)** is a type of broadband internet connection that sends wired data transmissions over telephone lines.

The download and upload rates don't need to be the same. In such cases, the line is said to be _asymmetrical_ and the ADSL abbreviation is used.
Contrast with cable, fiber optic, or dial-up connections.
