Time To Live (TTL) can refer to either the lifetime of a packet in a network, or the expiry time of cached data.

## Networking

In networking, the TTL, embedded in the packet, is a usually defined as a number of hops or as an expiration timestamp after which the packet is dropped. It provides a way to avoids network congestion, but releasing packets after they roamed the network too long.

## Caching

In the context of caching, TTL (as an unsigned 32-bit integer) being a part of the {{Glossary("Response header", "HTTP response header")}} or the {{Glossary("DNS")}} query, indicates the amount of time in seconds during which the resource can be cached by the requester.
