Interpolation is a process of calculating values based on known values. The interpolation is used to obtain intermediate values of properties, such as height, width, etc., during the process of their animation. In gradients, interpolation is used to define intermediate values of colors based on a provided list of colors. Also, the term "interpolation" is used as a description of the substitution of strings in the template literals.
