**Bun** is a fast, modern {{Glossary("JavaScript")}} runtime environment designed to prioritize performance and developer tooling. It supports {{Glossary("TypeScript")}}, and JSX out of the box.

Unlike [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Deno](https://deno.com/), Bun is built on Apple's [JavaScriptCore](https://trac.webkit.org/wiki/JavaScriptCore). Notable features of Bun include:

- Extremely fast JavaScript and TypeScript execution.
- Native support for modern JavaScript features like JSX and ES modules.
- Global cache for managing package installations to minimize disk usage.
- Built-in bundler, transpiler, [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) compatible test-runner and package manager.
