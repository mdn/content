A **long task**Â  is a task that takes more than 50ms to complete.

It is an uninterrupted period where the [main UI thread](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Main_thread) is busy for 50 ms or longer. Common examples include long running event handlers, expensive [reflows](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Reflow) and other re-renders, and work the browser does between different turns of the event loop that exceeds 50 ms.
