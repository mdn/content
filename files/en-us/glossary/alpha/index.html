<p>Colors are represented in digital form as a collection of numbers, each representing the strength or intensity level of a given component of the color. Each of these components is called a <strong>channel</strong>. In a typical image file, the color channels describe how much red, green, and blue are used to make up the final color. To represent a color through which the background can be seen to some extent, a fourth channel is added to the color: the <strong>alpha channel</strong>. The alpha channel specifies how opaque the color is.</p>

<p>For example, the color <code>#8921F2</code> (also described as <code>rgb(137, 33, 242)</code> or <code>hsl(270, 89%, 54)</code>) is a nice shade of purple. Below you see a small box of that color in the top-left corner and a box of the <em>same</em> color but with an alpha channel set at 0.5 (50% opacity). The two boxes are drawn on top of a paragraph of text.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Image showing the effect of an alpha channel on a color." src="alpha-channel-example.png"></p>

<p>As you can see, the color without an alpha channel completely blocks the background text, while the box with the alpha channel leaves it visible through the purple background color.</p>
