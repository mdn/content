<p>An {{Glossary("HTTP")}} error code meaning "Bad Gateway".</p>

<p>A {{Glossary("Server", "server")}} can act as a gateway or proxy (go-between) between a client (like your Web browser) and another, upstream server. When you request to access a {{Glossary("URL")}}, the gateway server can relay your request to the upstream server. "502" means that the upstream server has returned an invalid response.</p>

<p>Normally the upstream server is not down (i.e. furnishes no response to the gateway/proxy), but does not understand the same data-exchange protocol as the gateway/proxy. Internet {{Glossary("Protocol", "protocols")}} are quite explicit, and so a 502 usually means that one or both machines were incorrectly or incompletely programmed.</p>
