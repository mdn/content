A _native_ application has been compiled to run on the hardware/software environment that comprises the targeted architecture.

An example of a native Android app would be a mobile application written in Java using the Android toolchain.

On the other hand, a Web App that runs inside a browser is not native — it is run in the web browser, which sits on top of the native environment, not the native environment itself.
