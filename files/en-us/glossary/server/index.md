A server is a software or hardware offering a service to a user, usually referred to as client.  A hardware server is a shared computer on a network, usually powerful and housed in a data center.  A software server (often running on a hardware server) is a program that provides services to client programs or a {{glossary("UI","user interface")}} to human clients.

Services are provided generally over local area networks or wide area networks such as the internet. A client program and server program traditionally connect by passing messages encoded using a {{glossary("protocol")}} over an {{glossary("API")}}.

For example:

- An Internet-connected Web server is sending a {{glossary("HTML")}} file to your browser software so that you can read this page
- Local area network server for file, name, mail, print, and fax
- Minicomputers, mainframes, and super computers at data centers
