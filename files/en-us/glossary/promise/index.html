<p>A <strong>{{jsxref("Promise")}}</strong> is an {{Glossary("object")}} that's returned by a {{Glossary("function")}} that has not yet completed its work. The promise literally represents a promise made by the function that it will eventually return a result through the promise object.</p>

<p>When the called function finishes its work {{Glossary("asynchronous", "asynchronously")}}, a function on the promise object called a resolution (or fulfillment, or completion) handler is called to let the original caller know that the task is complete.</p>
