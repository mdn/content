<p>Inheritance is a major feature of {{glossary("OOP","object-oriented programming")}}.Â  Data abstraction can be carried up several levels, that is, {{glossary("class","classes")}} can have superclasses and subclasses.</p>

<p>As an app developer, you can choose which of the superclass's {{glossary("attribute","attributes")}} and {{glossary("method","methods")}} to keep and add your own, making class definition very flexible. Some languages let a class inherit from more than one parent (multiple inheritance).</p>
