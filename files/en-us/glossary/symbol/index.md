A **symbol** is a data type that represents unique, unforgeable identifiers. They are sometimes called _atoms_.

Because a symbol is unique and unforgeable, you can only read a property value associated with a symbol if you have a reference to the original identifier.

In JavaScript, `symbol` is one of the [primitive types](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Primitive) and can be created using the [`Symbol()`](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) factory method that returns a different symbol each time. They can be used as keys for objects which can never accidentally collide with other properties.

JavaScript also defines two other categories of symbols: well-known symbols and registered symbols. Read the {{jsxref("Symbol")}} reference for more information.
