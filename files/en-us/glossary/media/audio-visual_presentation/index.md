The term **media** (more accurately, **multimedia**) refers to audio, video, or combined audio-visual material such as music, recorded speech, movies, TV shows, or any other form of content that is presented over a period of time.

More broadly, media may include still images such as photographs or other still images.

Media content can be recorded, played back, presented, and at times interacted with in various ways.
