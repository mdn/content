<p>In the context of {{Glossary("CSS")}} (Cascading Style Sheets), the term <strong><dfn>media</dfn></strong> refers to the destination to which the document is to be drawn by the {{Glossary("rendering engine")}}.</p>

<p>Typically, this is a screen—but it may also be a printer, a speech synthesizer, Braille display, or another type of device.</p>

<p>CSS offers several features that allow you to tweak your document's styles—or even offer different styles—according to the media <strong>type</strong> (such as screen or print, to name two) or media <strong>capabilities</strong> (such as width, resolution, or other values) of the viewer's device.</p>
