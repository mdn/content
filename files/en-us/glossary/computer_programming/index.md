Computer programming is a process of composing and organizing a collection of instructions. These tell a computer/software program what to do in a language which the computer understands. These instructions come in the form of many different languagesÂ such as C++, Java, JavaScript, HTML, Python, Ruby, and Rust.

Using an appropriate language, you can program/create all sorts of software. For example, a program that helps scientists with complex calculations, a database that stores huge amounts of data, a web site that allows people to download music, or animation software that allows people to create animated movies.
