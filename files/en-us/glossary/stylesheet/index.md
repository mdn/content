A **stylesheet** is a set of CSS rules used to control the layout and design of a webpage or document. _Internal_ stylesheets are placed inside a {{htmlelement("style")}} element inside the {{htmlelement("head")}} of a web document, and _external_ stylesheets are placed inside a separate `.css` file, which is applied to a document by referencing the file inside a {{htmlelement("link")}} element in the document's head.

External stylesheets are generally preferred because they allow you to control the styling of multiple pages from a single place, rather than having to repeat the CSS across each page.
