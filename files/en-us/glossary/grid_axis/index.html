<p>CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout method enabling the laying out of content in <em>rows</em> and <em>columns</em>. Therefore in any grid we have two axes. The <em>block or column axis</em>, and the <em>inline or row axis</em>.</p>

<p>It is along these axes that items can be aligned and justified using the properties defined in the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Box_Alignment_in_CSS_Grid_Layout">Box Alignment specification</a>.</p>

<p>In CSS the <em>block or column axis</em> is the axis used when laying out blocks of text. If you have two paragraphs and are working in a right to left, top to bottom language they lay out one below the other, on the block axis.</p>

<p>The <em>inline or row axis</em> runs across the Block Axis and is the direction along which regular text flows. These are our rows in CSS Grid Layout.</p>

<p><img alt="Diagram showing the inline axis in CSS Grid Layout." src="7_inline_axis.png"></p>

<p>The physical direction of these axes can change according to the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/CSS_Grid_Logical_Values_and_Writing_Modes">writing mode</a> of the document.</p>
