<p><span class="seoSummary">A modem ("<strong>modulator-demodulator</strong>") is a device that converts digital information to analog signals and vice-versa, for sending data through networks.</span> Different kinds are used for different networks: DSL modems for telephone wires, WiFi modems for short-range wireless radio signals, 3G modems for cellular data towers, and so on.</p>

<p>Modems are different from {{Glossary("Router","routers")}}, but many companies sell modems combined with routers.</p>
