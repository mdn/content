The principle of least privilege is a design consideration in computer security, according to which entities (including users, system processes, or programs) should be granted the minimum amount of access that they need in order to do their jobs.

For example, in a software development team, all members might need the ability to write to the source code repository, but only a subset of the team might need the ability to alter the repository's security settings.

Applying the principle of least privilege reduces the potential damage when an entity is compromised by an attacker: so for example, if a team member's account is compromised, then the damage that the attacker can do is limited by the privileges that were granted to that team member.
