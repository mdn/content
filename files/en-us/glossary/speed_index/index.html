<p><span class="seoSummary"><strong>Speed Index </strong>(SI) is a page load performance metric that shows you how quickly the contents of a page are visibly populated. <span class="ILfuVd">It is the average time at which visible parts of the page are displayed. Expressed in milliseconds, and dependent on the size of the viewport, t</span>he lower the score, the better.</span></p>

<p><img alt="Calculation of SpeedIndex" src="speedindex.png"></p>

<p>The calculation calculates what percent of the page is visually complete at every 100ms interval until the page is visually complete.  The overall score, the above the fold metric, is a sum of the individual 10 times per second intervals of the percent of the screen that is not-visually complete<strong>.</strong></p>
