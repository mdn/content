A user agent is a computer program representing a person, for example, a {{Glossary("Browser","browser")}} in a {{Glossary("World Wide Web", "Web")}} context.

Besides a browser, a user agent could be a bot scraping webpages, a download manager, or another app accessing the Web. Along with each request they make to the server, browsers include a self-identifying {{HTTPHeader("User-Agent")}} {{Glossary("HTTP")}} header called a user agent (UA) string. This string often identifies the browser, its version number, and its host operating system.

Spam bots, download managers, and some browsers often send a fake UA string to announce themselves as a different client. This is known as _user agent spoofing_.

The user agent string can be accessed with {{Glossary("JavaScript")}} on the client side using the {{domxref("Navigator/userAgent", "NavigatorID.userAgent")}} property.

A typical user agent string looks like this: `"Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:35.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/35.0"`.
