<p><strong>CRUD </strong>(Create, Read, Update, Delete) is an acronym for ways one can operate on stored data. It is a mnemonic for the four basic functions of persistent storage.  CRUD typically refers to operations performed in a database or datastore, but it can also apply to higher level functions of an application such as soft deletes where data is not actually deleted but marked as deleted via a status.</p>
