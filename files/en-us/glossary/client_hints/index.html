<p><strong>Client Hints</strong> are a set of <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers">HTTP request header</a> fields that a server can proactively request from a client in order to get information about the device, network, user and agent specific preferences. The server can then determine which resources to send based on the client information.</p>

<p>The set of "hint" headers are listed in the topic <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers#client_hints">HTTP Headers</a> and <a href="#hint_types">summarized below</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Overview">Overview</h2>

<p>A server must announce that it supports client hints, using the {{HTTPHeader("Accept-CH")}} header to specify the hints that it is interested in recieving.
  When a client that supports client hints receives the <code>Accept-CH</code> header it can append client hint headers that match the advertised field-values to subsequent requests.</p>

<p>For example, following <code>Accept-CH</code> in a response below, the client could append {{HTTPHeader("Width")}} and {{HTTPHeader("Downlink")}} headers to all subsequent requests.</p>

<pre class="brush: http">Accept-CH: Width, Downlink</pre>

<div class="notecard note">
  <h4>Note</h4>
  <p>Client hints can also be specified in HTML using the {{HTMLElement("meta")}} element with the <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#attr-http-equiv">http-equiv</a></code> attribute.</p>
  <pre>&lt;meta http-equiv="Accept-CH" content="Width, Viewport-Width, Downlink"&gt;</pre>
</div>


<h2 id="Caching_and_client_hints">Caching and Client Hints</h2>

<p>Client hints that determine which resources are sent in responses should "generally" also be included in the affected response's {{HTTPHeader("Vary")}} header. This ensures that a different resource is cached for every different value of the hint header.</p>

<pre class="brush: http">Vary: Accept, Width, ECT</pre>

<p>You may prefer to omit specifying {{HTTPHeader("Vary")}} or use some other strategy for client hint headers where the value changes a lot, as this effectively makes the resource uncachable (a new cache entry is created for every different value). This applies in particular to network client hints like {{HTTPHeader("Downlink")}} and {{HTTPHeader("RTT")}}. For more information see <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Caching#varying_responses">HTTP Caching > Varying responses</a>.</p>

<h2 id="hint_types">Hint types</h2>

<h3 id="device_client_hints">Device client hints</h3>

<p>Device client hints allow a server to choose what information is sent based on the device characteristics including available memory and screen properties. Headers include: {{HTTPHeader("Device-Memory")}}, {{HTTPHeader("DPR")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Width")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Viewport-Width")}}.</p>


<h3 id="network_client_hints">Network client hints</h3>

<p>Network client hints allow a server to choose what information is sent based on the user choice and network bandwidth and latency. Headers include: {{HTTPHeader("Save-Data")}}, {{HTTPHeader("Downlink")}}, {{HTTPHeader("ECT")}}, {{HTTPHeader("RTT")}}.</p>
