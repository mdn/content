<p><strong>OOP </strong>(Object-Oriented Programming) is an approach in programming in which data is encapsulated within <strong>{{glossary("object","objects")}}</strong> and the object itself is operated on, rather than its component parts.</p>

<p>{{glossary("JavaScript")}} is heavily object-oriented. It follows a <strong>prototype</strong>-based model (<a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Details_of_the_Object_Model#class-based_vs._prototype-based_languages">as opposed to class-based</a>).</p>
