**OOP** (Object-Oriented Programming) is an approach in programming in which data is encapsulated within **{{glossary("object","objects")}}** and the object itself is operated on, rather than its component parts.

{{glossary("JavaScript")}} is heavily object-oriented. It follows a [**prototype**-based model](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Inheritance_and_the_prototype_chain), but it also offers a [class syntax](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_classes) to enable typical OOP paradigms.
