**OOP** (Object-Oriented Programming) is an approach in programming in which data is encapsulated within **{{glossary("object","objects")}}** and the object itself is operated on, rather than its component parts.

{{glossary("JavaScript")}} is heavily object-oriented. It follows a **prototype**-based model ([as opposed to class-based](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Details_of_the_Object_Model#class-based_vs._prototype-based_languages)).
