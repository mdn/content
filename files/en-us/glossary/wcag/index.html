<p><em>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</em> (<strong>WCAG</strong>) are a recommendation published by the {{Glossary("WAI","Web Accessibility Initiative")}} group at the {{Glossary("W3C")}}. They outline a set of guidelines for making content accessible primarily for people with disabilities but also for limited-resource devices such as mobile phones.</p>

<p>WCAG 2.0 which superseded WCAG 1.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation on 11 December 2008. It consists of 12 guidelines organized under 4 principles (perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust) and each guideline has testable success criteria.</p>

<p>WCAG uses three levels of conformance:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Priority 1: Web developers <strong>must </strong>satisfy these requirements, otherwise it will be impossible for one or more groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described as A.</li>
 <li>Priority 2: Web developers <strong>should </strong>satisfy these requirements, otherwise some groups will find it difficult to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described as AA or Double-A.</li>
 <li>Priority 3: Web developers <strong>may </strong>satisfy these requirements, in order to make it easier for some groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described as AAA or Triple-A.</li>
</ul>
