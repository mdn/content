_Web Content Accessibility Guidelines_ (**WCAG**) is a recommendation published by the {{Glossary("WAI","Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)")}} group at the {{Glossary("W3C")}}, outlining a set of guidelines for making content {{glossary("accessibility", "accessible")}} primarily for people with disabilities, but also for limited-resource devices and services, such as digital assistants.

WCAG 2 consists of 13 guidelines organized under 4 principles (perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust) and each guideline has testable success criteria.

WCAG 2 uses three levels of conformance:

- Priority 1: Web developers **must** satisfy these requirements, otherwise it will be impossible for one or more groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described as A.
- Priority 2: Web developers **should** satisfy these requirements, otherwise some groups will find it difficult to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described as AA or Double-A.
- Priority 3: Web developers **may** satisfy these requirements, in order to make it easier for some groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described as AAA or Triple-A.

[WCAG 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) was published on Oct, 2023 and [WCAG 3.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/) is in development.
