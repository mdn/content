<p class="seoSummary"><strong>First Interactive,</strong> also known as <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/First_CPU_idle">first CPU idle</a>, is a non-standard web performance metric that measures when the user's window is quiet enough to handle user input, or what is termed as minimally interactive.</p>

<p>Minimally interactive is defined as when some, but not necessarily all, UI elements on the page have loaded and are interactive, and, on average, respond to user input in a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<p>First interactive is a variation of <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Time_to_interactive">Time to Interactive</a>, which is split into <em>First Interactive</em> and <em>Consistently Interactive</em>. These metrics have been proposed by the Web Incubator Community Group and are already being used in various tools. This metric has been called <em>First CPU Idle</em> since <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">Lighthouse 3.0</a></p>
