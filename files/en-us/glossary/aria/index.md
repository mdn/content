{{GlossarySidebar}}

**ARIA** (_Accessible Rich {{glossary("Internet")}} Applications_) is a {{Glossary("W3C")}} specification for adding semantics and other metadata to {{Glossary("HTML")}} to cater to users of assistive technology.

For example, you could add the attribute `role="alert"` to a {{HTMLElement("p")}} {{glossary("tag")}} to notify a sight-challenged user that the information is important and time-sensitive (which you might otherwise convey through text color).
