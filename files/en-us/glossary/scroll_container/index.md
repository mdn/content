A **scroll container** is an element box with scroll bars. When the content of an element box overflows its bounding box, users can use scroll bars to scroll through the clipped content that is otherwise hidden from view.

A user agent adds scroll bars when the {{cssxref("overflow")}} property is set to `scroll` or `auto`.

The visible part of a scroll container is called the {{glossary("Scrollport", "scrollport")}}.
