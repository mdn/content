A _mutable_ value is one that can be changed without creating an entirely new value. In {{glossary("JavaScript")}}, {{Glossary("Object","objects")}} and {{Glossary("Array","arrays")}} are mutable by default, but {{Glossary("primitive", "primitive values")}} are not â€” once a primitive value is created, it cannot be changed, although the variable that holds it may be reassigned.
