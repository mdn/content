_Mutable_ is a type of variable that can be changed. In {{glossary("JavaScript")}}, only {{Glossary("Object","objects")}} and {{Glossary("Array","arrays")}} are mutable, not {{Glossary("primitive", "primitive values")}}.

(You _can_ make a variable name point to a new value, but the previous value is still held in memory. Hence the need for garbage collection.)

A **mutable object** is an object whose state can be modified after it is created.

**Immutables** are the objects whose state cannot be changed once the object is created.

**Strings and Numbers** are **Immutable**. Lets understand this with an example:

    var immutableString = "Hello";

    // In the above code, a new object with string value is created.

    immutableString = immutableString + "World";

    // We are now appending "World" to the existing value.

On appending the "immutableString" with a string value, following events occur:

1.  Existing value of "immutableString" is retrieved
2.  "World" is appended to the existing value of "immutableString"
3.  The resultant value is then allocated to a new block of memory
4.  "immutableString" object now points to the newly created memory space
5.  Previously created memory space is now available for garbage collection.
