<p><em>Mutable</em> is a type of variable that can be changed. In {{glossary("JavaScript")}}, only {{Glossary("Object","objects")}} and {{Glossary("Array","arrays")}} are mutable, not {{Glossary("primitive", "primitive values")}}.</p>

<p>(You <em>can</em> make a variable name point to a new value, but the previous value is still held in memory. Hence the need for garbage collection.)</p>

<p>A <strong>mutable object</strong> is an object whose state can be modified after it is created.</p>

<p><strong>Immutables</strong> are the objects whose state cannot be changed once the object is created.</p>

<p><strong>Strings and Numbers</strong> are <strong>Immutable</strong>. Lets understand this with an example:</p>

<pre>var immutableString = "Hello";

// In the above code, a new object with string value is created.

immutableString = immutableString + "World";

// We are now appending "World" to the existing value.
</pre>

<p>On appending the "immutableString" with a string value, following events occur:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Existing value of "immutableString" is retrieved</li>
 <li>"World" is appended to the existing value of "immutableString"</li>
 <li>The resultant value is then allocated to a new block of memory</li>
 <li>"immutableString" object now points to the newly created memory space</li>
 <li>Previously created memory space is now available for garbage collection.</li>
</ol>
