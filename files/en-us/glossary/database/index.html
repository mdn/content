<p>A <strong>database</strong> is a storing system that collects organized data, to make some works easier like searching, structure, and extend.</p>

<p>In web development, most databases use the relational database management system (RDBMS) to organize data and programming in {{glossary("SQL")}}. Some databases, however, don't follow the former mechanism to organized data, which called NoSQL.</p>

<p>Some famous server-side RDBMS are <em>MySQL</em>(or <em>MariaDB</em> which is a fork of it), <em>SQL Server</em>, and <em>Oracle Database</em>. On the other hand, someÂ famous NoSQL examples are <em>MongoDB</em>, <em>Cassandra</em>, and <em>Redis</em>.</p>

<p>Browsers also have their own database system called {{glossary("IndexedDB")}}.</p>
