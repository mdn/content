In typography, **leading** is an amount of space included above and below text to provide spacing between lines. Historically, in physical typesetting, pieces of actual [lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead) were used to implement this spacing, which is where the name comes from.

In CSS, typographic leading is the difference between the content height and the line-height, generally set by the {{cssxref("line-height")}} property. Leading set via `line-height` provides spacing between lines, which can be negative. The space is distributed equally above and below the text, which is referred to as **half-leading**.

The area of a font above the cap baseline is referred to as the _over edge_. The area below the {{glossary("/Baseline/Typography", "alphabetic baseline")}} is referred to as the _under edge_. Likewise, the half-leading above and below a line is referred to as the _over leading_ and _under leading_, respectively.

The half-leading can be trimmed from the block-start edge and block-end edge of a text element's block container using the {{cssxref("text-box")}} properties.
