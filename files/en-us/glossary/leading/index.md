In typography, **leading** is an amount of space included above and below a font to contain its capital letters, ascenders, descenders, etc., and provide spacing between lines. Historically, in physical typesetting, pieces of actual [lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead) were used to implement this spacing, which is where the name comes from.

Digital fonts generally include an equal amount of space above and below the text, which is refered to as half-leading. The amount of space included varies between fonts.

The space at the start and end block edge of a font is referred to as over and under leading, respectively. The start and end boundaries of those areas are referred to as the over edge and under edge, respectively.
