<p><span class="seoSummary"><strong>Synthetic monitoring</strong> involves monitoring the performance of a page in a 'laboratory' environment, typically with automation tooling in an environment that is as consistent as possible.</span> With a consistent baseline, synthetic monitoring is good for measuring the effects of code changes on performance. However, it doesn't necessarily reflect what users are experiencing.</p>

<p>Synthetic Monitoring involves deploying scripts to simulate the path an end-user might take through a web application, reporting back the performance of the simulator experiences. Examples of popular synthetic monitoring tools include <a href="https://webpagetest.org">WebPageTest</a> and <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">Lighthouse</a>. The traffic measured is not of your actual users, but rather synthetically generated traffic collecting data on page performance.</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Real_User_Monitoring">RUM</a>, synthetic monitoring provides a narrow view of performance that doesn't account for user differences, making it useful in getting basic data about an application's performance and spot-checking performance in development environments. Combined with other tools, such as network throttling, can provide excellent insight into potential problem areas.</p>
