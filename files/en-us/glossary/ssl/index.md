Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, was the old standard security technology for creating an encrypted network link between a server and client, ensuring all data passed is private and secure. The current version of SSL is version 3.0, released by Netscape in 1996, and has been superseded by the {{Glossary("TLS", "Transport Layer Security (TLS)")}} protocol.
