The **canvas element** is part of [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5) and allows for dynamic, [scriptable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) [rendering](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendering_(computer_graphics)>) of 2D and 3D shapes and [bitmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap) images.

It is a low level, procedural model that updates a [bitmap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitmap) and does not have a built-in [scene graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph). It provides an empty graphic zone on which specific {{Glossary("JavaScript")}} {{Glossary("API","APIs")}} can draw (such as Canvas 2D or {{Glossary("WebGL")}}).
