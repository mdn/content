<p>An HTTP method is <strong>idempotent</strong> if an identical request can be made once or several times in a row with the same effect while leaving the server in the same state. In other words, an idempotent method should not have any side-effects (except for keeping statistics). Implemented correctly, the {{HTTPMethod("GET")}}, {{HTTPMethod("HEAD")}}, {{HTTPMethod("PUT")}}, and {{HTTPMethod("DELETE")}} methods are <strong>idempotent</strong>, but not the {{HTTPMethod("POST")}} method. All {{glossary("safe")}} methods are also idempotent.</p>

<p>To be idempotent, only the actual back-end state of the server is considered, the status code returned by each request may differ: the first call of a {{HTTPMethod("DELETE")}} will likely return a {{HTTPStatus("200")}}, while successive ones will likely return a {{HTTPStatus("404")}}. Another implication of {{HTTPMethod("DELETE")}} being idempotent is that developers should not implement RESTful APIs with a <em>delete last entry</em> functionality using the <code>DELETE</code> method.</p>

<p>Note that the idempotence of a method is not guaranteed by the server and some applications may incorrectly break the idempotence constraint.</p>

<p><code>GET /pageX HTTP/1.1</code> is idempotent. Called several times in a row, the client gets the same results:</p>

<pre>GET /pageX HTTP/1.1
GET /pageX HTTP/1.1
GET /pageX HTTP/1.1
GET /pageX HTTP/1.1
</pre>

<p><code>POST /add_row HTTP/1.1</code> is not idempotent; if it is called several times, it adds several rows:</p>

<pre>POST /add_row HTTP/1.1
POST /add_row HTTP/1.1   -&gt; Adds a 2nd row
POST /add_row HTTP/1.1   -&gt; Adds a 3rd row
</pre>

<p><code>DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1</code> is idempotent, even if the returned status code may change between requests:</p>

<pre>DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1   -&gt; Returns 200 if idX exists
DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1   -&gt; Returns 404 as it just got deleted
DELETE /idX/delete HTTP/1.1   -&gt; Returns 404</pre>
