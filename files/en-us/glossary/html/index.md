**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) is a declarative language that specifies webpage structure.

HTML is normally saved as an `.html` file, served by a {{Glossary("Server","web server")}}, and can be rendered by any {{Glossary("Browser","Web browser")}}.

## Brief history

In 1990, as part of his vision of the {{Glossary("World Wide Web","Web")}}, Tim Berners-Lee defined the concept of {{Glossary("hypertext")}}, which he then formalized the following year. The {{Glossary("IETF")}} began formally specifying HTML in 1993, and after several drafts released version 2.0 in 1995. In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the {{Glossary("W3C")}} to develop the Web. In 1996, the W3C took over the HTML work and published the HTML 3.2 recommendation a year later. HTML 4.0 was released in 1999 and became an {{Glossary("ISO")}} standard in 2000.

At that time, the W3C nearly abandoned HTML in favor of {{Glossary("XHTML")}}, prompting the founding of an independent group called {{Glossary("WHATWG")}} in 2004. Thanks to WHATWG, work on {{Glossary("HTML5")}} continued: the two organizations released the first draft in 2008 and the final standard in 2014.

## syntax

An HTML document is a plaintext document structured with [elements](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element). Elements are surrounded by matching opening and closing {{Glossary("tag","tags")}}. Each tag begins and ends with angle brackets (`<>`). There are a few empty tags that cannot enclose any text, for instance {{htmlelement("img")}}.

You can extend HTML elements with {{Glossary("attribute","attributes")}}:
