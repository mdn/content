<p>A <strong>block</strong> on a webpage is an {{glossary("HTML")}} {{glossary("element")}} that appears on a new line, i.e. underneath the preceding element in a horizontal writing mode, and above the following element (commonly known as a <em>block-level element</em>). For example, {{htmlelement("p")}} is by default a block-level element, whereas {{htmlelement("a")}} is an <em>inline element</em> — you can put several links next to one another in your HTML source and they will sit on the same line as one another in the rendered output.</p>

<p>Using the {{cssxref("display")}} property you can change whether an element displays inline or as a block (among many other options);<strong> blocks</strong> are also subject to the effects of positioning schemes and use of the {{cssxref("position")}} property.</p>
