A **relying party** is an entity that needs to control access to some resource, and to do so needs to authenticate other entities that are trying to access the resource. On the web a relying party is usually a website that allows users to sign in, and needs to authenticate users (for example by checking a password) before deciding whether to grant them access.

The website _relies on_ the validity of the credentials the browser presents when it grants access to its resources.
