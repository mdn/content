<p>Guard is a feature of {{domxref("Headers")}} objects (as defined in the {{domxref("Fetch_API","Fetch spec")}}, which affects whether methods such as {{domxref("Headers.set","set()")}} and {{domxref("Headers.append","append()")}} can change the header's contents. For example, <code>immutable</code> guard means that headers can't be changed. For more information, read <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Basic_concepts#guard">Fetch basic concepts: guard</a>.</p>
