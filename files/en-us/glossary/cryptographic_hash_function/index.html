<p>A cryptographic hash function, also sometimes called a <em>digest function</em>, is a {{glossary("cryptography", "cryptographic")}} primitive transforming a message of arbitrary size into a message of fixed size, called a {{glossary("digest")}}. Cryptographic hash functions are used for authentication, {{Glossary("digital signature", "digital signatures")}}, and {{Glossary("HMAC", "message authentication codes")}}.</p>

<p>To be used for cryptography, a hash function must have these qualities:</p>

<ul>
 <li>quick to compute (because they are generated frequently)</li>
 <li>not invertible (each digest could come from a very large number of messages, and only brute-force can generate a message that leads to a given digest)</li>
 <li>tamper-resistant (any change to a message leads to a different digest)</li>
 <li>collision-resistant (it should be impossible to find two different messages that produce the same digest)</li>
</ul>

<p>Cryptographic hash functions such as MD5 and SHA-1 are considered broken, as attacks have been found that significantly reduce their collision resistance.</p>
