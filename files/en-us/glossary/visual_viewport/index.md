The portion of the {{Glossary("viewport")}} that is currently visible is called the **visual viewport**. This can be smaller than the {{Glossary("layout viewport")}}, for example when the user has pinch-zoomed. The visual viewport is the visual portion of a screen excluding on-screen keyboards, areas outside of a pinch-zoom area, and any other on-screen artifact that doesn't scale with the dimensions of a page.
