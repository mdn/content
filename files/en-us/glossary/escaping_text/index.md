An **escape character** is a {{glossary("character")}} that invokes an alternative interpretation of the following character in a sequence, signaling that the following character should be interpreted differently.

In many programming languages, an escape character also forms some **escape sequences** that has a special meaning rather than the literal characters, marked by one or more preceding characters and possibly terminating characters.

- In {{glossary("JavaScript")}}, we can use the backslash (`\`) to escape characters like `\'`, `\"`, `\u0026`, etc.
- In {{glossary("CSS")}}, we can use the backslash (`\`) to escape characters like `\\`, `\n`, `\26`, etc. See [escaping characters](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/ident#escaping_characters) for more information.
- In {{glossary("HTML")}}, we can use {{glossary("character reference", "character references")}} like `&lt;`, `&#60;`, or `&#x3C;` to represent the less-than (`<`) symbol.
- In {{glossary("URL", "URLs")}}, we can use the percent sign (`%`) to escape characters like `%20`, `%3C`, `%3E`, etc.
