The hash function takes a variable-length message input and produces a fixed-length hash output. It is commonly in the form of a 128-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest". Hashes are very useful for {{glossary("cryptography")}} â€” they insure the integrity of transmitted data, and provide the basis for {{glossary("HMAC")}}, which enables message authentication.
