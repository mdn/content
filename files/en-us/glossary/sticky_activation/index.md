**Sticky activation** (or "sticky user activation") is a window state that indicates a user has pressed a button, moved a mouse, used a menu, or performed some other user interaction. It is not reset during the frame's lifetime after it has been set initially (unlike {{Glossary("Transient activation")}}).

See [Features gated by user activation](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/User_activation) for examples of APIs that require _sticky activation_.
