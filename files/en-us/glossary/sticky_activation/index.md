**Sticky activation** (or "sticky user activation") is a window state that indicates a user has pressed a button, moved a mouse, used a menu, or performed some other user interaction.

A page is considered "user activated" if a user is currently interacting with the page or has completed a touch, pointer, or keyboard interaction since page load. With sticky user activation, if activation is set it is not reset for the duration of the session (unlike {{Glossary("Transient activation")}}).

See [Features gated by user activation](/en-US/docs/Web/Security/User_activation) for examples of APIs that require _sticky activation_.

See the {{domxref("UserActivation.hasBeenActive")}} property to programmatically access the current window's sticky activation state.
