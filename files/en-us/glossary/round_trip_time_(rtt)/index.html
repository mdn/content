<p><strong>Round Trip Time (RTT)</strong> is the length time it takes for a data packet to be sent to a destination plus the time it takes for an acknowledgment of that packet to be received back at the origin. The RTT between a network and server can be determined by using the <code>ping</code> command.</p>
