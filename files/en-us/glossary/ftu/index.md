FTU (First Time Use) is the app that loads when you run a newly-installed version of {{glossary("Gecko")}} on a {{glossary("Firefox OS")}} device.

You can use FTU to set many important options (e.g. timezone, Wi-Fi details, default language, importing contacts), or take the "Phone Tour" to find out more about your device.
