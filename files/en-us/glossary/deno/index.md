**Deno** is a runtime environment for {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, {{Glossary("TypeScript")}}, and {{glossary("WebAssembly")}}.

Like {{glossary("Node.js")}}, Deno is based on the V8 JavaScript engine and enables developers to run JavaScript outside browsers. However, there are some notable differences between Node and Deno. In particular, Deno:

- Has built-in support for TypeScript.
- Restricts file system and network access by default.
- Includes a large standard library, including implementations of many Web APIs.
- Does not depend on a centralized registry, instead allowing modules to be loaded from URLs.
