<p>An encoding defines a mapping between bytes and text. A sequence of bytes allows for different textual interpretations. By specifying a particular encoding (such as UTF-8), we specify how the sequence of bytes is to be interpreted.</p>

<p>For example, in HTML we normally declare a character encoding of UTF-8, using the following line:</p>

<pre class="brush: html">&lt;meta charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;</pre>

<p>This ensures that you can use characters from just about any human language in your HTML document, and they will display reliably.</p>
