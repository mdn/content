In {{glossary("cryptography")}}, a ciphertext is a scrambled message that conveys information but is not legible unless {{glossary("decryption","decrypted")}} with the right {{glossary("cipher")}} and the right secret (usually a {{glossary("key")}}), reproducing the original {{glossary("Plaintext")}}. A ciphertext's security, and therefore the secrecy of the contained information, depends on using a secure cipher and keeping the key secret.
