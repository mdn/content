<p>SCM (Source Control Management) is a system for managing source code. Usually it refers to the use of software to handle versioning of source files. A programmer can modify source code files without being afraid of editing out useful stuff, because a SCM keeps track of how the source code has changed and who made the changes.</p>

<p>Some SCM systems include CVS, SVN, GIT.</p>
