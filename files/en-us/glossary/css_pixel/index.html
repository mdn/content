<p>The <strong>CSS pixel</strong>—denoted in {{Glossary("CSS")}} with the suffix <code>px</code>—is a unit of length which roughly corresponds to the width or height of a single dot that can be comfortably seen by the human eye without strain, but is otherwise as small as possible. By definition, this is the physical size of a single pixel at a pixel density of 96 DPI, located an arm's length away from the viewer's eyes.</p>

<p>That definition, of course, leaves a lot of wiggle room, as the terms "be comfortably seen" and "an arm's length away" are imprecise, varying from person to person. When a user is sitting at a desk in front of a desktop, the display is generally substantially farther away from their eyes than when they're on a cell phone, for instance.</p>

<p>As such, it generally suffices to say that when the unit <code>px</code> is used, the goal is to try to have the distance <code>96px</code> equal about 1 inch on the screen, regardless of the actual pixel density of the screen. In other words, if the user is on a phone with a pixel density of 266 DPI, and an element is placed on the screen with a width of <code>96px</code>, the actual width of the element would be 266 {{Glossary("Device pixel","device pixels")}}.</p>
