<p>A fork is a copy of an existing software project at some point to add someone's own modifications to the project.</p>

<p>Basically, if the license of the original software allows, you can copy the code to develop your own version of it, with your own additions, which will be a "fork".</p>

<p>Forks are often seen in free and open source software development. This is now a more popular term thanks to contribution model using Git (and/or the GitHub platform).</p>
