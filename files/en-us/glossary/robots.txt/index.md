A **robots.txt** is a file that is usually placed in the root of a website (for example, `https://www.example.com/robots.txt`).
It specifies whether or not {{Glossary("crawler", "crawlers")}} are allowed access to an entire website, or to specified resources.
A restrictive `robots.txt` file can prevent bandwidth consumption by crawlers.

A site owner can forbid crawlers to detect a certain path (and all files in that path) or a specific file.
This is often done to prevent these resources from being indexed or served by search engines.

If a crawler is allowed to access resources, you can define [indexing rules](/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/X-Robots-Tag#directives) for those resources via [`<meta name="robots">`](/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/meta/name/robots) elements (commonly referred to as a "robots tag") and {{HTTPHeader("X-Robots-Tag")}} HTTP headers.
Search-related crawlers use these rules to determine how to index and serve resources in search results, or to adjust the crawl rate for specific resources over time.
