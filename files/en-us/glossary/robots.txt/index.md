Robots.txt is a file which is usually placed in the root of any website. It decides whether {{Glossary("crawler", "crawlers")}} are permitted or forbidden access to the web site.

For example, the site admin can forbid crawlers to visit a certain folder (and all the files therein contained) or to crawl a specific file, usually to prevent those files being indexed by other search engines.
