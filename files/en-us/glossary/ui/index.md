**User Interface** (UI) is anything that facilitates the interaction between a user and a machine. In the world of computers, it can be anything from a keyboard, a joystick, a screen or a program. In case of computer software, it can be a command-line prompt, a webpage, a user input form, or the front-end of any application.
