A _mixin_ is a {{Glossary("class")}} (interface, in WebAPI spec terms) whose {{Glossary("method", "methods")}} and/or {{Glossary("property", "properties")}} are meant to be incorporated into other classes. Any class that implements a mixin gains that mixin's properties and methods. Thus, mixins provide a way to reuse code among classes.

For example, the `WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope` mixin provides methods and properties for both the {{domxref("Window")}} and {{domxref("WorkerGlobalScope")}} interfaces.
