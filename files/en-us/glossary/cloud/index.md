The **Cloud** refers to servers located worldwide that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers.

Instead of storing data or running programs on a local computer or server, users can access cloud resources to perform tasks: this is known as {{glossary("Cloud computing")}}.

Key features of the cloud include:

- Remote Access: Data and services are accessed remotely.
- Scalability: Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand.
- Availability: Services and data are typically accessible from anywhere with internet access.
