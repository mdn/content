**Cloud** refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers.
Instead of storing data or running programs on a local computer or server, users rely on these remote resources. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using {{glossary("Cloud Computing")}}, users and companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.

### Key features of the Cloud

- Remote Access: Data and services are accessed remotely.
- Scalability: Resources can be scaled up or down based on demand.
- Availability: Services and data are typically accessible from anywhere with internet access.
