<p>An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of features and rules that exist inside a software program (the application) enabling interaction with it through software - as opposed to a human user interface. The API can be seen as a simple contract (the interface) between the application offering it and other items, such as third party software or hardware.</p>

<p>In Web development, an API is generally a set of code features (e.g. {{glossary("method","methods")}}, {{Glossary("property","properties")}}, events, and {{Glossary("URL","URLs")}}) that a developer can use in their apps for interacting with components of a user's web browser, or other software/hardware on the user's computer, or third party websites and services.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
 <li>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/MediaDevices/getUserMedia">getUserMedia</a> API can be used to grab audio and video from a user's webcam, which can then be used in any way the developer likes, for example, recording video and audio, broadcasting it to another user in a conference call, or capturing image stills from the video.</li>
 <li>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Geolocation">Geolocation API</a> can be used to retrieve location information from whatever service the user has available on their device (e.g. GPS), which can then be used in conjunction with the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google Maps APIs</a> to for example plot the user's location on a custom map and show them what tourist attractions are in their area.</li>
 <li>The <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/overview/api">Twitter APIs</a> can be used to retrieve data from a user's twitter accounts, for example, to display their latest tweets on a web page.</li>
 <li>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API">Web Animations API</a> can be used to animate parts of a web page — for example, to make images move around or rotate.</li>
</ul>
