<p>XLink is a W3C standard which is used to describe links between XML and XML or other documents. Some its behaviors are left to the implementation to determine how to handle.</p>

<p>Simple XLinks are "supported" in Firefox (at least in SVG and MathML), though they do not work as links if one loads a plain XML document with XLinks and attempts to click on the relevant points in the XML tree.</p>

<p>For those who may have found XLink 1.0 cumbersome for regular links, XLink 1.1 drops the need to specify <code>xlink:type="simple"</code> for simple links.</p>

<p>XLink is used in <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/SVG">SVG</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/MathML">MathML</a>, and other important standards.</p>
