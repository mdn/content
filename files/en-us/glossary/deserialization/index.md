The process whereby a lower-level format (e.g. that has been transferred over a network, or stored in a data store) is translated into a readable object or other data structure.

In {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}, for example, you can deserialize a {{Glossary("JSON")}} {{Glossary("string")}} to an object by calling the {{Glossary("function")}} {{jsxref("JSON.parse()")}}.
