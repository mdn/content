Software {{Glossary("specification", "specifications")}} often contains information marked as  **non-normative** or _informative_, which means that those are provided there to help the readers to understand the specification better or to show an example or a best practice and not need to be followed as a rule. Sections that contain the official part of the specification that must be followed are often marked as {{Glossary("normative", "normative")}}.
