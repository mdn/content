<p>Software {{Glossary("specification", "specifications")}} often contains information marked as  <em>non-normative</em> or <em>informative,</em> which means that those are provided there for the purpose of helping the readers to understand the specification better or to show an example or a best practice, and not needed to be followed as a rule. Sections that contain official part of the specification that must be followed are often marked as {{Glossary("normative", "normative")}}.</p>
