**Time to First Byte** (TTFB) refers to the time between the browser requesting a page and when it receives the first byte of information from the server.Â  This time includes [DNS](/en-US/docs/Glossary/DNS) lookup and establishing the connection using a [TCP](/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP) handshake and [SSL](/en-US/docs/Glossary/SSL) handshake if the request is made over [https](/en-US/docs/Glossary/https).

TTFB is the time it takes between the start of the request and the start of the response, in milliseconds:

    TTFB = responseStart - navigationStart
