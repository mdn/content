A **grid column** is a vertical track in a [CSS grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout), and is the space between two vertical grid lines. It is defined by the {{cssxref("grid-template-columns")}} property or in the shorthand {{cssxref("grid")}} or {{cssxref("grid-template")}} properties.

In addition, columns may be created in the _implicit grid_ when items are placed outside of columns created in the _explicit grid_. These columns will be auto-sized by default, or can have a size specified with the {{cssxref("grid-auto-columns")}} property.

When working with alignment in [CSS grid layout](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout), the axis down which columns run is known as the _block, or column, axis_.
