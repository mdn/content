The **DOM** (Document Object Model) is an {{glossary("API")}} that represents and interacts with any {{glossary("HTML")}} or {{glossary("XML")}} document. The DOM is a document model loaded in the {{glossary("browser")}} and representing the document as a node tree, where each node represents part of the document (e.g. an {{Glossary("element")}}, text string, or comment).

The DOM is one of the most-used {{Glossary("API")}}s on the {{glossary("World Wide Web","Web")}} because it allows code running in a browser to access and interact with every node in the document. Nodes can be created, moved and changed. Event listeners can be added to nodes and triggered on occurrence of a given event.

DOM was not originally specified—it came about when browsers began implementing {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}. This legacy DOM is sometimes called DOM 0. Today, the WHATWG maintains the DOM Living Standard.
