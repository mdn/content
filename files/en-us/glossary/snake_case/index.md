**Snake case** is a way of writing phrases without spaces, where spaces are replaced with underscores `_`, and the words are typically all lower case. It's often stylized as "snake_case" to remind the reader of its appearance.

Snake casing is often used as a variable naming convention. The following names are in snake case: `left_shift`, `bitwise_invert`, `matrix_transpose`.

Note that snake case never contains upper case letters. Sometimes, constants are written in all-uppercase, such as JavaScript's {{jsxref("Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER")}}. This is not typically considered as snake case. Instead, it is sometimes called _screaming snake case_.

Snake case is the most popular convention in Python, Rust, and various other languages.
