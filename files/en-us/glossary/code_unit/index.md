A **code unit** is the basic component used by a character encoding system (such as UTF-8 or UTF-16). A character encoding system uses one or more code units to encode a Unicode {{Glossary("code point")}}.

In UTF-16 (the encoding system used for JavaScript strings) code units are 16-bit values. This means that operations such as indexing into a string or getting the length of a string operate on these 16-bit units. These units do not always map 1-1 onto what we might consider characters.

For example, characters with diacritics such as accents can sometimes be represented using two Unicode code points:

```js
const myString = '\u006E\u0303';
console.log(myString); // Ã±
console.log(myString.length); // 2
```

Also, since not all of the code points defined by Unicode fit into 16 bits, many Unicode code points are encoded as a pair of UTF-16 code units, which is called a _surrogate pair_:

```js
const face = 'ðŸ¥µ';
console.log(face.length); // 2
```

The {{jsxref("String/codePointAt", "codePointAt()")}} method of the JavaScript {{jsxref("String")}} object enables you to retrieve the Unicode code point from its encoded form:

```js
const face = 'ðŸ¥µ';
console.log(face.codePointAt(0)); // 129397
```
