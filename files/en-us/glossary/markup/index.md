A markup language is one that is designed for defining and presenting text. {{glossary("HTML")}} (HyperText Markup Language), is an example of a markup language.

Within a text file such as an HTML file, elements are _marked up_ using {{glossary("Tag","tags")}} which explain the purpose of that part of the content.

## Types of markup language

- **Presentational Markup:**
  - : Used by traditional word processing system with WYSIWYG (what you see it is what you get); this is hidden from human authors, users and editors.
- **Procedural Markup:**
  - : Combined with text to provide instructions on text processing to programs. This text is visibly manipulated by the author.
- **Descriptive Markup:**
  - : Labels sections of documents as to how the program should handle them. For example, the HTML {{HTMLElement("td")}} defines a cell in a HTML table.
