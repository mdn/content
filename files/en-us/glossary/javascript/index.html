<h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2>

<p>JavaScript (or "JS") is a programming language used most often for dynamic client-side scripts on webpages, but it is also often used on the {{Glossary("Server","server")}}-side, using a runtime such as <a href="https://nodejs.org/" rel="external">Node.js</a>.</p>

<p>JavaScript <strong>should not</strong> be confused with the {{interwiki("wikipedia", "Java_(programming_language)", "Java programming language")}}. Although <em>"Java"</em> and <em>"JavaScript"</em> are trademarks (or registered trademarks) of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries, the two programming languages are significantly different in their syntax, semantics, and use cases.</p>

<p>JavaScript is primarily used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through the {{Glossary("DOM")}}, manipulate data with {{Glossary("AJAX")}} and {{Glossary("IndexedDB")}}, draw graphics with {{Glossary("canvas")}}, interact with the device running the browser through various {{Glossary("API","APIs")}}, and more. JavaScript is one of the world's most commonly-used languages, owing to the recent growth and performance improvement of {{Glossary("API","APIs")}} available in browsers.</p>

<h2 id="Origins_and_History">Origins and History</h2>

<p>Conceived as a server-side language by Brendan Eich (then employed by the Netscape Corporation), JavaScript soon came to Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995. JavaScript enjoyed immediate success and {{glossary("Microsoft Internet Explorer", "Internet Explorer 3.0")}} introduced JavaScript support under the name JScript in August 1996.</p>

<p>In November 1996, Netscape began working with ECMA International to make JavaScript an industry standard. Since then, the standardized JavaScript is called ECMAScript and specified under ECMA-262, whose latest (eleventh, ES2020) edition is available as of June 2020.</p>

<p>Recently, JavaScript's popularity has expanded even further through the successful <a href="https://nodejs.org/" rel="external">Node.js</a> platform—the most popular cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment outside the browser. Node.js - built using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)">Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine</a> - allows developers to use JavaScript as a scripting language to automate things on a computer and build fully functional {{Glossary("HTTP")}} and {{Glossary("WebSockets")}} servers.</p>
