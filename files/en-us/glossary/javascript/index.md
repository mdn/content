## Summary

JavaScript (or "JS") is a programming language used most often for dynamic client-side scripts on webpages, but it is also often used on the {{Glossary("Server","server")}}-side, using a runtime such as [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

JavaScript **should not** be confused with the {{interwiki("wikipedia", "Java_(programming_language)", "Java programming language")}}. Although _"Java"_ and _"JavaScript"_ are trademarks (or registered trademarks) of Oracle in the U.S. and other countries, the two programming languages are significantly different in their syntax, semantics, and use cases.

JavaScript is primarily used in the browser, enabling developers to manipulate webpage content through the {{Glossary("DOM")}}, manipulate data with {{Glossary("AJAX")}} and {{Glossary("IndexedDB")}}, draw graphics with {{Glossary("canvas")}}, interact with the device running the browser through various {{Glossary("API","APIs")}}, and more. JavaScript is one of the world's most commonly-used languages, owing to the recent growth and performance improvement of {{Glossary("API","APIs")}} available in browsers.

## Origins and History

Conceived as a server-side language by Brendan Eich (then employed by the Netscape Corporation), JavaScript soon came to Netscape Navigator 2.0 in September 1995. JavaScript enjoyed immediate success and {{glossary("Microsoft Internet Explorer", "Internet Explorer 3.0")}} introduced JavaScript support under the name JScript in August 1996.

In November 1996, Netscape began working with ECMA International to make JavaScript an industry standard. Since then, the standardized JavaScript is called ECMAScript and specified under ECMA-262, whose latest (eleventh, ES2020) edition is available as of June 2020.

Recently, JavaScript's popularity has expanded even further through the successful [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) platform—the most popular cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment outside the browser. Node.js - built using [Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V8_(JavaScript_engine)>) - allows developers to use JavaScript as a scripting language to automate things on a computer and build fully functional {{Glossary("HTTP")}} and {{Glossary("WebSockets")}} servers.
