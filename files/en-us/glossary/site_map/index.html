<p><span class="seoSummary">A <strong>site map</strong> or <strong>sitemap</strong> is a list of pages of a web site.</span> Structured listings of a site's page help with <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO">search engine optimization</a>, providing a link for web crawlers such as search engines to follow. Site maps also help users with site navigation by providing an overview of a site's content in a single glance.</p>
