A **site map** or **sitemap** is a list of pages of a website.

Structured listings of a site's page help with {{Glossary("seo", "search engine optimization")}} (SEO), providing a link for web crawlers such as search engines to follow. Site maps also help users with site navigation by providing an overview of a site's content in a single glance.
