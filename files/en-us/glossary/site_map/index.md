A **site map** or **sitemap** is a list of pages of a web site.

Structured listings of a site's page help with [search engine optimization](/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO), providing a link for web crawlers such as search engines to follow. Site maps also help users with site navigation by providing an overview of a site's content in a single glance.
