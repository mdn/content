**Cloud computing** refers to the on-demand delivery of a wide range of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, analytics, and intelligence via the Internet â€” also known as **cloud services**.

Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet. Cloud services are provided by companies such as Google (Google Cloud Platform), Amazon AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Microsoft (Azure). Users can access cloud services with nothing more than a computer, operating system, and internet connectivity. They can use cloud-based services through a _pay-as-you-go_ pricing model, ensuring they only pay for what they use, making them highly efficient and adaptable solutions for businesses and individuals alike. This model enables faster innovation, flexible scalability, and significant cost savings.

The three main types of cloud computing are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Each type of cloud computing provides different levels of control, flexibility, and management.

- Infrastructure as a Service
  - : IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, including servers, storage, and networking, allowing users to manage their infrastructure. This gives users a high level of flexibility and control over the resources. Companies using IaaS can scale their server infrastructure rapidly without owning physical servers. Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS EC2), Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, and Google Compute Engine (GCE).
- Platform as a Service
  - : PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure (like servers, storage, and networking). Developers using PaaS can focus on writing code and application logic, without managing servers or operating systems. Examples include Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service, Heroku, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- Software as a Service
  - : SaaS delivers software applications over the internet, which users can access via a web browser. The underlying infrastructure, platform, and data are all managed by the provider. Businesses using SaaS don't need to install or manage software locally. Instead, they access the software (like email, CRM, or collaboration tools) directly from a web browser. Examples include Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, Github, and ChatGPT.
