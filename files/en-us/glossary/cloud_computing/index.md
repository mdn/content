**Cloud Computing** refers to the on-demand delivery of a wide range of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, analytics, and intelligence via the Internet.

This model enables faster innovation, flexible scalability, and significant cost savings. Users can access and utilize these services through a _pay-as-you-go_ pricing model, ensuring they only pay for what they use, making it a highly efficient and adaptable solution for businesses and individuals alike.

> **Note:** The {{glossary("Cloud")}} in Cloud Computing refers to the server infrastructure on which cloud services are built and hosted.

### Cloud Services

Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet. Users can access cloud services with nothing more than a computer, operating system, and internet connectivity.

### Cloud Service Providers (CSP)

Cloud Service Providers are the companies which provides these cloud services. Most popular cloud service providers are Google (Google Cloud Platform), Amazon AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Microsoft (Azure). They offer similar services with different price models, features and so on.

### Types of Cloud Computing

The three main types of cloud computing include Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS), Platform as a Service(PaaS), and Software as a Service(SaaS). Each type of cloud computing provides different levels of control, flexibility, and management so that you can select the right set of services for your needs.

#### Infrastructure as a Service

IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, including servers, storage, and networking, allowing users to rent and manage the infrastructure they need which gives the users highest level of flexibility and control over the resources.

> **Use case:** A company needing to scale its server infrastructure rapidly without owning physical servers might use IaaS.

**Examples:** Amazon Web Services (AWS EC2), Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine (GCE)

#### Platform as a Service

PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure (like servers, storage, and networking).

> **Use case:** A developer who wants to focus on writing code and application logic, without managing servers or operating systems, would use PaaS.

Examples: Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service, Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk

#### Software as a Service

SaaS delivers software applications over the internet, which users can access via a web browser. The underlying infrastructure, platform, and data are all managed by the provider.

> **Use case:** A business using SaaS doesn't need to install or manage software locally. Instead, they access the software (like email, CRM, or collaboration tools) directly from a web browser.

Examples: Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, Github, ChatGPT

### Cloud Deployment MOdels

A cloud deployment model essentially defines where the infrastructure for your deployment resides and determines who has ownership and control over that infrastructure. It also determines the cloud's nature and purpose. Cloud deployment models can be divided into five main types as Public Cloud, Private Cloud, Hybrid Cloud, Multi-Cloud and Community cloud.

#### Public Cloud

Shared, low-cost, scalable resources available to the public.

> **Use case:** Small to medium businesses or startups that need cost-effective, scalable solutions without managing physical hardware.

Examples: AWS (Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

#### Private Cloud

Dedicated infrastructure for a single organization with high control and security.

> **Use case:** Large enterprises or organizations with strict security and compliance requirements, such as banks or government agencies.

Examples: VMware Private Cloud, OpenStack, IBM Cloud Private

#### Hybrid Cloud

Combines public and private clouds for flexibility and scalability.

> **Use case:** Organizations that need to balance sensitive data security with the scalability of the public cloud, such as those with fluctuating workloads.

Examples: Microsoft Azure Hybrid Cloud, AWS Outposts, Google Anthos

#### Multi Cloud

It's a strategic approach to leverage the best tools from each cloud provider, ensuring the organization gets the maximum benefit from cloud computing.

> **Use case:** When companies or users need specific features only offered by certain cloud providers.

Examples: An e-commerce company using AWS for its Scalability, Google Cloud for Machine Learning functions and Microsoft Azure for better compliance with security standards.

#### Community Cloud

Shared infrastructure among organizations with common goals or compliance needs.

> **Use case:** Multiple organizations in the same industry (e.g., healthcare, education, finance) with shared concerns about compliance and security.

Examples: Cloud infrastructure for government agencies or healthcare institutions
