**Cloud computing** refers to the on-demand delivery of a wide range of computing services such as servers, storage, databases, networking, analytics, and intelligence via the Internet â€” also known as **cloud services**.

This model enables faster innovation, flexible scalability, and significant cost savings. Users can use cloud-based services through a _pay-as-you-go_ pricing model, ensuring they only pay for what they use, making them highly efficient and adaptable solutions for businesses and individuals alike.

## Cloud Services

Cloud services are infrastructure, platforms, or software that are hosted by third-party providers and made available to users through the internet. Users can access cloud services with nothing more than a computer, operating system, and internet connectivity.

## Cloud Service Providers (CSP)

**Cloud service providers** are companies that provide cloud services, such as Google (Google Cloud Platform), Amazon AWS (Amazon Web Services), and Microsoft (Azure).

### Types of Cloud computing

The three main types of cloud computing are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Each type of cloud computing provides different levels of control, flexibility, and management.

`Infrastructure as a Service`

IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet, including servers, storage, and networking, allowing users to manage their infrastructure. This gives users a high level of flexibility and control over the resources.

- **Use case:** A company needing to scale its server infrastructure rapidly without owning physical servers.

- **Examples:** Amazon Web Services (AWS EC2), Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, Google Compute Engine (GCE).

`Platform as a Service`

PaaS provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure (like servers, storage, and networking).

- **Use case:** A developer who wants to focus on writing code and application logic, without managing servers or operating systems.

- **Examples:** Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service, Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

`Software as a Service`

SaaS delivers software applications over the internet, which users can access via a web browser. The underlying infrastructure, platform, and data are all managed by the provider.

- **Use case:** A business using SaaS doesn't need to install or manage software locally. Instead, they access the software (like email, CRM, or collaboration tools) directly from a web browser.

- **Examples:** Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack, Github, ChatGPT.
