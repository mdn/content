<p><strong>FTP </strong>(File Transfer Protocol) was the standard {{glossary("protocol")}} for many years for transferring files from one {{glossary("host")}} to another over the Internet. Increasingly, though, teams and hosting accounts don't allow FTP and instead rely on a version control system like Git. You will still find it used on older hosting accounts, but it is safe to say that FTP is no longer considered best practice.</p>
