<p><em>Synchronous</em> refers to real-time communication where each party receives (and if necessary, processes and replies to) messages instantly (or as near to instantly as possible).</p>

<p>A human example is the telephone — during a telephone call you tend to respond to another person immediately.</p>

<p>Many programming commands are also synchronous — for example when you type in a calculation, the environment will return the result to you instantly, unless you program it not to.</p>
