<p><span class="seoSummary">The <strong>accessibility tree</strong> contains {{Glossary("accessibility")}}-related information for most HTML elements.</span></p>

<p>Browsers convert markup into an internal representation called the <em><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_object_model/How_to_create_a_DOM_tree">DOM tree</a></em>. The DOM tree contains objects representing all the markup’s elements, attributes, and text nodes. Browsers then create an accessibility tree based on the DOM tree, which is used by platform-specific Accessibility APIs to provide a representation that can be understood by assistive technologies, such as screen readers.</p>

<p>There are four things in an accessibility tree object:</p>

<dl>
 <dt><strong>name</strong></dt>
 <dd>How can we refer to this thing? For instance, a link with the text "Read more" will have "Read more" as its name (find more on how names are computed in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/">Accessible Name and Description Computation spec</a>).</dd>
 <dt><strong>description</strong></dt>
 <dd>How do we describe this thing, if we want to provide more description beyond the name? The description of a table could explain what kind of information the table contains.</dd>
 <dt><strong>role</strong></dt>
 <dd>What kind of thing is it? For example, is it a button, a nav bar, or a list of items?</dd>
 <dt><strong>state</strong></dt>
 <dd>Does it have a state? Examples include checked or unchecked for checkboxes, and collapsed or expanded for the <code><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary">&lt;summary&gt;</a></code> element.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Additionally, the accessibility tree often contains information on what can be done with an element: a link can be <em>followed</em>, a text input can be <em>typed into</em>, etc.</p>

<p>While still in draft form within the Web Incubator Community Group, the <strong><a href="https://wicg.github.io/aom/explainer.html">Accessibility Object Model</a> (AOM)</strong> intends to incubate APIs that make it easier to express accessibility semantics and potentially allow read access to the computed accessibility tree.</p>
