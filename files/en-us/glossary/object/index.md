In JavaScript, objects can be seen as a collection of properties. With the [object literal syntax](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_types#object_literals), a limited set of properties are initialized; then properties can be added and removed. Property values can be values of any type, including other objects, which enables building complex data structures. Properties are identified using _key_ values. A _key_ value is either a {{Glossary("String", "String value")}} or a {{Glossary("Symbol", "Symbol value")}}.

There are two types of object properties: The [_data_ property](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#data_property) and the [_accessor_ property](/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures#accessor_property).

> **Note:** It’s important to recognize it’s accessor _property_ — not accessor _method_. We can give a JavaScript object class-_like_ accessors by using a function as a value — but that doesn't make the object a class.
