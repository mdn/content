<p><strong>UX</strong> is an acronym that stands for User eXperience. It is the study of the interaction between users and a system. Its goal is to make a system easy to interact with from the user's point of view.</p>

<p>The system can be any kind of product or application that an end user is meant to interact with. UX studies undertaken on a web page for example can demonstrate whether it is easy for users to understand the page, navigate to different areas, and complete common tasks, and where such processes could have less friction.</p>
