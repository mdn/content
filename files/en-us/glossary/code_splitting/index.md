**Code splitting** is the practice of splitting the code a web application depends on — including its own code and any third-party dependencies — into separate bundles that can be loaded independently of each other.
This allows an application to load only the code it actually needs at a given point in time, and load other bundles on demand.
This approach is used to improve application performance, especially on initial load.

Code splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) and [Browserify](https://browserify.org/) which can create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime.
