A **credential** is an object which enables a system to make an {{glossary("authentication")}} decision: for example, to decide whether to sign a user into an account.

In web security, types of credential include:

- a password
- biometric data
- a token entered from a one-time SMS code
- the key used to make authentication assertions in a public-key system such as [Web Authentication](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Authentication_API)

The [Credential Management API](/en-US/docs/Web/API/Credential_Management_API) enables developers to create, store, and retrieve various types of credential.
