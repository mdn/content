<p><strong>DNS (Domain Name System)</strong> is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for Internet connected resources. DNS maintains a list of {{Glossary("domain name","domain names")}} along with the resources, such as IP addresses, that are associated with them.</p>

<p>The most prominent function of DNS is the translation of human-friendly domain names (such as mozilla.org) to a numeric {{Glossary("IP address")}} (such as 151.106.5.172); this process of mapping a domain name to the appropriate IP address is known as a <strong>DNS lookup</strong>. By contrast, a <strong>reverse DNS lookup</strong> (rDNS) is used to determine the domain name associated with an IP address.</p>
