**MathML** (an {{glossary("XML")}} application) is an open standard for representing mathematical expressions in webpages.  In 1998 the W3C first recommended MathML for representing mathematical expressions in the {{glossary("browser")}}. MathML has other applications also including scientific content and voice synthesis.
