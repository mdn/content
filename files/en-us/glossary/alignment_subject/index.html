<p>In <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Alignment">CSS Box Alignment</a> the <strong>alignment subject</strong> is the thing (or things) being aligned by the property.</p>

<p>For {{cssxref("justify-self")}} and {{cssxref("align-self")}}, the alignment subject is the margin box of the box the property is set on, using the writing mode of that box.</p>

<p>For {{cssxref("justify-content")}} and {{cssxref("align-content")}}, the writing mode of the box is also used. The definition of the alignment subject depends on the layout mode being used.</p>
