{{GlossarySidebar}}

Snap positions are points where the {{Glossary("scroll container", "scrollport")}} stops moving after the scrolling operation completes. Setting up snap positions allows to create a scrolling experience of paging through content instead of needing to drag content into view.

Snap positions are set up on a {{Glossary("scroll container")}}. See the [CSS Scroll Snap](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_scroll_snap) properties.
