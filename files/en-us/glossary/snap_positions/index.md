A [scroll container](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scroll_container) may set **snap positions** â€” points that the [scrollport](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scrollport) will stop moving at after a scrolling operation is completed. This allows a scrolling experience that gives the effect of paging through content rather than needing to drag content into view.

Defining Snap positions on the scroll container was introduced in the [CSS Scroll Snap specification](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scroll_Snap).
