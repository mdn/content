Snap positions are points where the [scrollport](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scrollport) stops moving after the scrolling operation completes. Setting up snap positions allows to create a scrolling experience of paging through content instead of needing to drag content into view.

Snap positions are set up on a [scroll container](/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scroll_container). See the [CSS Scroll Snap](/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scroll_Snap) properties.
