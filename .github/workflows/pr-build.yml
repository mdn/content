# Note that this workflow uses `get-diff-action` which is important.
# It gives us an environment variable called `GIT_DIFF` which is a string
# that is a list of file paths.
# If you want to do what this workflow does on your laptop you can simulate
# it like this:
#
#    export GIT_DIFF=`git diff --name-only main... | grep 'files/' | grep '\.html$'`
#    node content build --no-progressbar --files="${GIT_DIFF}"
#
# That way, you can behave on your laptop like, this action behaves here.
