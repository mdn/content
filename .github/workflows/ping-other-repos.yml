name: Ping other repos
# This workflow exists for this use case: When another repo wants to take
# some action each time an MDN PR is merged and a change is pushed to the
# MDN main branch. For example, other repos that pull in content directly
# from MDN as part of their own builds might want to automatically re-run
# their repo build scripts each time a change is pushed to MDN upstream.
#
# https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data/blob/main/.github/workflows/ping-other-repos.yml
# has the BCD equivalent of this workflow.
