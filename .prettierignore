# A full pass on all Markdown files is being performed.
# The following folders still need a full pass:
/files/en-us/mozilla/add-ons/**/*.md
/files/en-us/web/html/**/*.md
/files/en-us/web/javascript/**/*.md
/files/en-us/web/svg/**/*.md
/files/en-us/web/web_components/**/*.md

!/files/en-us/web/api/[a-w]*/**/*.md
