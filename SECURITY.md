# Security Policy

## Overview

This policy applies to MDN's website (`developer.mozilla.org`), backend services, and GitHub repositories in the [`mdn`](https://github.com/mdn) organization. Issues affecting other Mozilla products or services should be reported through the [Mozilla Security Bug Bounty Program](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/bug-bounty/).

For non-security issues, please file a [content bug](https://github.com/mdn/content/issues/new/choose), a [website bug](https://github.com/mdn/fred/issues/new/choose) or a [content/feature suggestion](https://github.com/mdn/mdn/issues/new/choose).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security issue, please report it privately via <https://hackerone.com/mozilla>.

If you prefer not to use HackerOne, you can report it via <https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/form.web.bounty>.

## Bounty Program

Vulnerabilities in MDN may qualify for Mozilla's Bug Bounty Program. Eligibility and reward amounts are described on <https://hackerone.com/mozilla>.

Please use the above channels even if you are not interested in a bounty reward.

## Responsible Disclosure

Please do not publicly disclose details until Mozilla's security team and the MDN engineering team have verified and fixed the issue.

We appreciate your efforts to keep MDN and its users safe.
