In general, we do not approve of copying content from other sources and putting
it on MDN. MDN should be made up of original content wherever possible. If we
receive a pull request and discover that it contains plagiarized content,
we will close it and request that the submitter resubmit the change with
the content rewritten into their own words.

If someone wants to donate an article to MDN that they previously published on
their blog or it makes sense to copy a complex reference sheet to MDN there may
be justification for republishing it. In these cases you should discuss your
plan with the MDN team first:

1. Include a comment on the relevant repo issue that explains your intention â€” say
   what you would like to copy (include the URL) and explain why you think this
   is appropriate.
1. If the content is published under a closed license:
   - If you hold the rights to the content, state this, and say that you are
     happy to republish it on MDN.
   - If you do not hold the rights to the content, include the author/publisher
     on the issue if possible, or include details of how they could be contacted
     so we can ask them for permission to republish the content.
1. If the content is published under an open license, say what it is, and link
   to the license so we can check whether it is compatible with [MDN's license](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/About#using_mdn_web_docs_content).
1. @-mention chrisdavidmills on the issue, so he can review the request.

Be warned that unless there is a good reason to republish the content, we will
probably say "no". The MDN writing team's decision is final.
