There are a lot of code examples on MDN, and you'll probably want to add
some as you contribute content to the project. There are four types of
code example used on MDN:

- [Static examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Code_examples#Static_examples)
  — plain code blocks, possibly with a screenshot to statically show the
  result of such code if it were to be run.
- [Traditional MDN "live samples"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Code_examples#Traditional_live_samples)
  — A macro that takes plain code blocks, dynamically puts
  them into a document inside an `<iframe>` element, and embeds it into the
  page to show the code running live.
- [GitHub "live samples"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Code_examples#GitHub_live_samples)
  — A macro that takes a document in a GitHub repo inside the [MDN organization](https://github.com/mdn),
  puts it inside an `<iframe>` element, and embeds
  it into the page to show the code running live.
- [Interactive examples](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Code_examples#Interactive_examples)
  — Our system for creating live interactive examples that show the
  code running live but also allow you to change code on the fly to see what
  the effect is.

For a complete description of this topic, see
[the MDN code examples page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Structures/Code_examples).

Also make sure that your code examples follow the
[MDN code example guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Guidelines/Code_guidelines).
