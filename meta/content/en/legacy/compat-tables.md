The browser compatibility table shown near the bottom of many of the
MDN document pages, for example on
[the JavaScript Array page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array#Browser_compatibility),
is generated from the `npm` package created from the <https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data>
repository. If you'd like to make or suggest a change to the content of
the browser compatibility table on any given MDN document page, you can either
use the `Report problems with this data on GitHub` link in the upper-right
corner of the table on the page itself to create an issue, or go to
<https://github.com/mdn/browser-compat-data> and
