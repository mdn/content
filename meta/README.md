# [MDN Web Docs for Contributors site generator](https://github.com/mdn/content/tree/main/meta)

This directory contains the tools and content for the [MDN Web Docs for Contributors site](https://mdn-contributor-docs.mozilla.org/), also known as the meta documentation. While MDN documents the web platform, this site documents MDN itself.

If you want to document an MDN tool or process, use this site generator and its content (found in this repository's `/meta/content/en/` directory). If you want to document a web platform technology, see [MDN Web Docs for Contributors](https://mdn-contributor-docs.mozilla.org/) instead.

## Get started

Before you author or develop this site, you need:

- A clone of the mdn/content repository
- Node.js
- Yarn 1

To get started:

1. Switch to the `meta` directory: Run `cd meta`.
2. Install the dependencies: Run `yarn`.
3. Start the development server: Run `yarn run start`.
4. Open the URL provided by the development server's `Web Server is available at` message.

Edit the Markdown files in the `content/en` subdirectory.

## Getting help

If you want to contribute more to this tooling and documentation or to get help, reach out to the MDN contributors via [mdn/content discussions](https://github.com/mdn/content/discussions) or via [Matrix chat](https://chat.mozilla.org/#/room/#mdn:mozilla.org).
