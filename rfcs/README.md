# MDN RFCs

MDN RFC (Request for Comment) documents are intended to concisely summarize a
proposal for a larger work item that we should consider doing on MDN. This
includes what problems are being solved by the work, what benefits it brings to
MDN and the wider web industry, how much effort it will take, and what the
work involves.

Once submitted, RFCs are used to assess and prioritize upcoming MDN work. They
are considered as part of our [Content opportunity assessment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Processes/Workstream_assessment_project#content_opportunity_assessment)
process.

## What should the RFC contain?

The RFC should contain the following:

- A title and opening paragraph that summarizes the work proposed by the RFC.
- Problem statement: A paragraph that explains why we should do this work, in
  the form of a problem statement â€” a problem that MDN/the web industry
  currently faces, and what we should do about it.
- Priority assessment: A list of criteria that each RFC is assessed against,
  with a description of how the RFC scores against each one. This section uses
  the [OWD prioritization criteria](https://github.com/openwebdocs/project/blob/main/steering-committee/prioritization-criteria.md).
- Proposed solutions: At a high level, what solution or solutions are being
  proposed to fix the problem stated earlier?
- Task list: A lower-level set of tasks that would need to be completed to
  implement the solution(s) detailed above. This obviously can't be 100%
  accurate at the planning stage; rough ideas are fine for now.

When creating a new RFC, use an existing RFC as a template.

## Submitting an RFC

Submit your RFC as a markdown file in this directory of the `content` repo,
as a PR.

## Getting feedback

Once written, an RFC document should be sent around to key stakeholders that
can provide the most valuable feedback on the document, for example MDN core
writers or engineers, [MDN PAB](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/MDN/MDN_Product_Advisory_Board)
members, [Open Web Docs](https://github.com/openwebdocs/) members, writers of
associated technology specifications, etc.

The MDN team are happy to help you with this; feel free to ask on submission.
